**Stock Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning**

I. OVERVIEW

The stock market is a nonlinear and dynamic system and the investor sentiment plays an important role in 
it. Researchers have demonstrated that the investor sentiment can drive the stock market. Robert J. 
Shiller found that the behavior of investors led to the 1987 stock market crash, popularly known as Black 
Monday. Hence a method for quantifying investor sentiment is required. Sentiment Analysis is a powerful 
tool that can be deployed to capture this sentiment. It involves extracting viewpoints and attitudes by 
analyzing textual data. Based on the extracted information, the bullish or bearish trend of the stock 
market can be predicted. This information helps us to decide whether to sell or buy stocks. 

II. FLOW OF THE PROJECT

The machine learning models are trained on the dataset prepared for the period 2012-2021 and the final 
portfolio is calculated using the prepared dataset for the period 2022-2023. 
1. Scrape training data: 
● Top 10 news headlines of each day for the period 2012-2021 is scraped from the website 
https://takemeback.to/ and CNN using BeautifulSoup. 
● The news from both the sources are combined to ensure minimum null values in the 
dataset. 
● Financial news articles and reports are also scraped for each day of the same period 
from New York Times using Selenium. 
● Python’s datetime module is used to iterate over each day from the period 2012-2021. 
2. Sentiment Analysis and Feature Extraction: 
● The dataset scraped is cleaned by removing punctuation marks and sentiment scores 
like positive score, neutral score and negative score are calculated by feeding the 
cleaned data to HuggingFace RoBERTa model.The model is run on GPU to reduce 
runtime significantly. 
● The final sentiment scores for each day is calculated by taking the mean of sentiment 
scores of each news headline of that day. 
● The day-of-the-week effect is applied to calculate the sentiment scores. According to this 
effect, a great number of news is released on the weekends. The behavior of investors is 
likely to change on Monday with such considerable news. Taking account of this effect, 
following formula is used in this project for calculating sentiment scores for every Monday 
in the dataset:

Smodified = e-2 SSaturday + e-1 SSunday + SMonday 
where S stands for sentiment score. 

● Lagged features are created for sentiment scores for past 7 days. 
● Moving averages are calculated for sentiment scores with a rolling window of 7 days. 
3. Training the Model: 
● Historical data is taken from Yahoo Finance for Amazon for the period 2012-2021. 
● Labels are created for each based on the following criteria: 
Label -
    0 if Close n < Close n-1 
    1 if Close n > Close n-1 
where Close n is the closing price for the nth day and Close n-1 is the closing price for (n-1)th 
day.

● Lagged features and moving averages are calculated for closing prices also as done 
earlier for sentiment scores. 
● Features extracted from the sentiment analysis are merged with this data. 
● Only the lagged features and moving scores are taken in the final training data for 
machine learning models and the target variable is Label. 
● The data is split into 80-20 ratio for training and testing ML models. 
● Classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random 
Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Support Vector Classifier and Linear Discriminant 
Analysis are used for training. 
4. Model Evaluation: 
● All the models used are evaluated based on the following metrics: 
○ Accuracy 
○ Precision 
○ Recall 
○ F1-Score 
○ ROC Curve Analysis
5. Calculating Portfolio: 
● A new dataset is prepared by scraping data for the period 2022-2023. 
● The dataset is preprocessed as done for the training data and the selected model is used 
to predict the target variable. 
● A trading strategy is devised and buy and sell points are identified combining the strategy 
and predicted output. 
● Trades are made for the stock and the final portfolio is calculated. 
● Portfolio metrics like sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, number of trades executed and 
win ratio are calculated. 

Sharpe Ratio  =   (𝑅𝑝 − 𝑅𝑓)/𝜎
where Rp = return of portfolio 
      Rf = risk-free rate 
      𝜎 =  standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return. 

Maximum Drawdown  =  (𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 − 𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒)/𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 x 100 
where trough value = minimum value of the portfolio in the trading period 
      peak value = maximum value of portfolio before reaching the trough value 

Win Ratio  =  (𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑠/𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑠) x 100 

III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRADING STRATEGY 
Overnight Trading 
● In this project, the type of trading technique adopted is ‘Overnight Trading’. It refers to 
trades that are placed after an exchange’s close and before its open. It is an extension of 
after-hours trading. 
● The input features for prediction by the model includes lagged features and moving 
averages for the positive and negative sentiment scores and closing price of the stock. 
● For example, if we are trading on the nth day, we have lagged features and moving 
averages for (n-1)th day to (n-7)th day and the increase or decrease of closing prices is 
predicted for the nth day. Finally the trades are executed using the closing price of (n-1)th 
day. 
Contrarian Trading 
● The other trading strategy involved is the ‘Contrarian Trading’ strategy. Contrarian trading 
is based on the principle that the market tends to overreact to news and events, causing 
price movements that may not accurately reflect the underlying fundamentals of the 
securities involved. In such scenarios these overreactions can create opportunities for 
profit. 
● In this project, the buy and sell signals are generated using this strategy. 
● For example, if the model predicts the market to go up on a day, a sell signal is 
generated for that day and if the market is predicted to go down, a buy signal is 
generated. Also, we trade aggressively, which implies we either use all cash at once to 
buy stocks when a buy signal is generated or sell all shares at once on a sell signal and 
wait for the next buy signal to reinvest.

IV. Portfolio Analysis 
Invested Amount - $30000 
Stocks in portfolio: 
● Amazon (AMZN) 
● Google (GOOGL) 
● Microsoft (MSFT)
Mean final returns is observed to be 139.57%.

Results: 
The mean final return is so high because of the high return rate for Amazon portfolio. This occurred because 
the ML model was trained on Amazon’s historical data. So if we consider it as an outlier, our final returns for a 
portfolio range from 40% - 50%. 
Limitations of the project: 
● There are fewer participants in the market after regular trading hours, leading to lower trading 
volumes. Due to lower trading volumes and liquidity, prices can be more volatile during overnight 
trading sessions. Even small trades can have a significant impact on the price of a security. 
● Significant price gaps can occur between the closing price of the regular trading session and the 
opening price of the after-hours session, and similarly, between the close of the after-hours 
session and the next regular session opening. 
● Strong market trends, driven by fundamental factors, can persist for extended periods, making 
contrarian trade challenging. This can result in significant losses if the prevailing trend continues 
longer than anticipated. 
● Successful aggressive trading often depends on precise market timing, which is challenging even 
for experienced traders.
