2022-01-03,"Michael W. Lucas made big plans to take a trip around the world in March 2020. He arranged to travel from his home in Detroit to Tokyo, then attend conferences in Hong Kong and Bangalore, India, before making a final stop in Paris.
But on his first attempt to buy plane tickets, this ambitious itinerary — costing $2,932.48 — got the attention of Capital One, which blocked the charges.

“I was both annoyed and pleased that the credit card company caught that someone was booking unusual flights,” said Mr. Lucas, a 54-year-old technology writer who is also an author of mystery novels. After calling the bank to explain his plans, the transactions went through smoothly. (The trip, however, was ultimately canceled because of the pandemic.)
Mr. Lucas’s fraud alerts were made possible by an invisible force tiptoeing into Wall Street: cloud computing. Before moving into the cloud, his bank, Capital One, was limited to tracking fraud using the bandwidth of the servers it owned. Now that it rents capacity from Amazon Web Services, the bank can use machine learning to crunch numbers faster — and on an enormous scale — to detect anything out of the ordinary.
As Mr. Lucas put it: “The cloud is a fancy word for ‘other people’s computers.’”

Banks see huge potential for cloud technology to make their systems faster, more nimble and responsive to the needs of their customers. Consumer banks can develop cloud-based tools to quickly introduce new features in mobile banking apps or detect fraud. Lenders can use the cloud to process loan applications and analyze underwriting decisions for everything from mortgages to corporate borrowing. They can use machine learning to detect money laundering. When volumes spike in financial markets, traders can use extra computing power to analyze price movements and handle bursts of client activity.
Still, the banking industry has been mostly slow to adopt cloud computing. Currently, major banks run their own data centers, which house computer servers that process vast troves of customer account data, payment records and trading logs. Running the machines is costly because they require a lot of electricity and also need to be kept in air-conditioned rooms.
While Wall Street leaders have long acknowledged the potential of cloud computing to cut costs, they have only allowed their firms to take halting steps. Executives have been hesitant because banks are tightly regulated by governments and any sudden changes involving consumer deposits or privacy aren’t possible. They’re also concerned that computing over the internet will open the door to cyberattacks. And some firms are held back by old computer systems that are difficult to revamp or retire, making the transition even more tricky.

David M. Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, is optimistic about financial-services firms moving into the cloud. However, “it’s got to be done with high levels of security and real protection of data and information,” Mr. Solomon said in an interview. “That’s why you’ve got to go slowly and you’ve got to go cautiously,” he said.

In North America, banks handle only 12 percent of their tasks on the cloud, but that could double in the next two years, the consulting firm Accenture said in a survey. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said the bank needed to adopt new technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud technology “as fast as possible.”

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Wells Fargo plans to move to data centers owned by Microsoft and Google over several years; Morgan Stanley is also working with Microsoft. Bank of America has saved $2 billion a year in part by building its own cloud. Goldman said in November that it would team up with Amazon Web Services to give clients access to mountains of financial data and analytical tools.
Cloud services enable banks to rent data storage and processing power from providers including Amazon, Google or Microsoft, which have their own data centers dotted around the globe. After moving to the cloud, banks can access their data on the internet and use the tech companies’ computing capacity when needed, instead of running their own servers year-round.
Seeing a big opportunity to sell cloud-computing services to Wall Street, some tech giants have hired former bankers who can use their knowledge of the rules and constraints under which banks operate to pitch the industry.
Scott Mullins, AWS’s head of business development for financial services, previously worked at JPMorgan and Nasdaq. Yolande Piazza, vice president for financial services at Google Cloud, is the former chief executive of Citi FinTech, an innovation unit at Citigroup. Bill Borden at Microsoft and Howard Boville at IBM are Bank of America alumni.

Cloud providers are “moving at a much faster development pace when you think of security, compliance and control structures,” compared with individual banks, said Mr. Borden, a corporate vice president for worldwide financial services at Microsoft. The cloud, Mr. Borden and the other executives said, enables companies to increase their computer processing capabilities when they need it, which is much cheaper than running servers on their own premises.
But glitches do occur. One week after Goldman teamed up with Amazon, an AWS outage halted webcasts from a conference hosted by the bank that convened chief executives from the biggest U.S. financial firms. The glitch also caused problems for Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, Disney’s streaming service and Ticketmaster. AWS and its competitor, Microsoft Azure, both had outages recently.

Banking regulators in the United States, including the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, have jointly underscored the need for lenders to manage risks and have backup systems in place when they outsource technology to cloud providers. The European Banking Authority warned firms about concentration risk, or becoming overly reliant on a single tech company.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees broker dealers — firms that engage in trading activity — has already moved all its technology to the cloud. The group previously spent tens of millions of dollars a year to run its own servers but now rents space on AWS servers for a fraction of that amount, said Steven J. Randich, FINRA’s chief information officer.
Mr. Randich estimated that without the cloud, FINRA would have had to bear at least $100 million in expenses to track market movements using its own data centers — especially as trading volumes have ballooned in recent years.
“We are all in,” Mr. Randich said. The use of web-based systems has enabled FINRA to process hundreds of billions of market records, and its surveillance staff to analyze unusual trading activity by pulling data in seconds or minutes, compared with hours earlier. But Mr. Randich added that “there’s a way to do it right and there’s a way to do it wrong,” and the wrong way can expose a company to security breaches.

Capital One is all too aware of the risks. In 2019, it suffered one of the largest-ever thefts of data from a bank after a hacker obtained the personal data of over 100 million people. The bank was fined $80 million by a regulator and ordered to strengthen its security controls as it moved information-technology operations into the cloud. It also agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit covering 98 million consumers for $190 million.
“Security of our customer data is of paramount importance, and we invested heavily in our cybersecurity capabilities to defend that,” said Mike Eason, Capital One’s chief information officer for data and machine learning in Richmond, Va.

Despite the breach, Capital One said it had experienced huge benefits from migrating to the cloud. It shut all eight of its data centers last year and runs its technology via AWS. As customers ramped up spending for the holidays, the bank used rented servers to handle a seasonal surge in transactions, without having to pay for all the servers year-round as it did before. It also plans to move most retail call-center operators to work permanently from home.

The new arrangement works well for Rosie Hardy, a call center worker for Capital One in Tampa. In March 2020, with the pandemic raging, Ms. Hardy packed up her tech gear into a big cardboard box and drove home to Gibsonton, Fla. Within an hour, she was back online from her spare bedroom bathed in natural light, fielding calls from the bank’s small-business customers.
Ms. Hardy and her colleagues were untethered from phone banks because of a service that routes calls through the cloud, enabling them to work remotely. “You couldn’t tell where I was. All I needed was internet access, and I picked up like we never left,” Ms. Hardy said."
2022-01-04,"OpenSea, one of the most talked-about blockchain start-ups in Silicon Valley, said on Tuesday that it had raised $300 million in new venture capital, making it the latest company to cash in on a rush to fund cryptocurrency start-ups.
The new round of funding, led by the investment firms Paradigm and Coatue Management, brings the start-up’s valuation to a staggering $13.3 billion just four years after it was founded. OpenSea previously raised more than $100 million from a host of investors, including the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz and the actor Ashton Kutcher, according to data provided by the company.
Founded in 2017, OpenSea was created as a marketplace for people to buy and sell so-called NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, which are unique pieces of digital code backed by blockchain technology.
NFT items can vary, but the most popular tokens are pieces of digital art created by artists who list their pieces for auction on the OpenSea site, similar to listing on eBay. Winning bids can sometimes reach hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Ether, a popular cryptocurrency and blockchain technology connected to most kinds of NFTs.

As crypto-focused start-ups have grown more popular in recent months, OpenSea has become the central place for enthusiasts to trade NFTs. That has attracted the attention of investors who are keen to place increasingly large bets on the busy cryptocurrency space.
More than $3 billion in private investment went into NFT companies in 2021, according to data compiled by PitchBook, a firm that tracks private investments. Overall, investors poured more than $28 billion into cryptocurrency and NFT start-ups around the world last year, PitchBook said.
“In 2021, the world woke up to the potential of NFTs to unlock utility and economic empowerment across a vast set of industries, communities and creative categories,” said Devin Finzer, one of the founders and the chief executive of OpenSea. “Our vision is to be the destination for these new open digital economies to thrive.”
Still, many cryptocurrency critics think the frenzy around NFTs and blockchain technology is a fad, plagued by questionable activity. Last week, there was a brief controversy surrounding OpenSea after one of its patrons claimed that $2.2 million worth of NFTs had been stolen from him. (OpenSea later froze the stolen assets and prohibited the items from being traded on its site.)
Those worries have not stopped technologists. Start-ups focused on cryptocurrencies and NFTs are recruiting droves of employees from big tech companies like Meta, Google and Amazon, luring them with the promise of working on new — and potentially lucrative — technologies. Last year, Brian Roberts, a former chief financial officer at Lyft, left the ride-hailing company to join OpenSea as its first chief financial officer. The company also recently hired Shiva Rajaraman, a former vice president of commerce for Meta, as its vice president of product.

The company said it planned to use the new funding to add to its more than 90 employees, while doubling the size of its trust and safety team. The company also plans to invest heavily in product development to make its blockchain technology more accessible to mainstream consumers, and will soon start a grant program to support creators and blockchain builders in the NFT space.
News that OpenSea was seeking funding was earlier reported by the tech newsletter Newcomer."
2022-01-05,"Twenty-five years after “Scream,” Neve Campbell is still seeing Ghostface everywhere she goes.
This past Halloween, Campbell brought her children to a pumpkin patch in Hollywood, where they saw fellow visitors dressed in the groaning Ghostface masks worn by the murderers who have tormented her character in these undying horror movies.
Though the costumed revelers didn’t seem to notice Campbell, she resisted her older son’s urgings to reveal that they were in the presence of Sidney Prescott, the intrepid “Scream” heroine she has played since 1996.
“My 9-year-old hasn’t seen the movies, but he obviously knows about them,” Campbell said. “And he was like, ‘Mom, you should go tell them!’ I’m not going to walk over and be like, ‘Hey, do you know who I am?’” She laughed and added, “Although it probably would be fun for them.”
Hearing Campbell’s tale, her two longtime “Scream” co-stars joked about how their connections to the films affected them at Halloween. Courteney Cox, who plays the strident TV personality Gale Weathers, said that she kept her own supply of Ghostface masks: “I bought five from Amazon.”

David Arquette said it was even easier to remind people of his screen identity as the hapless officer Dewey Riley. “Why do you think I have this mustache?” he asked.
At its release, “Scream” reinvented the slasher picture, populating it with photogenic cast members who were well-versed in the genre’s rules and tired of its clichés. It made a star of its screenwriter, Kevin Williamson, reinvigorated the career of its director, Wes Craven, and kicked off a cottage industry of imitators and parodies.
The slow-burn success of the first movie elevated its lead actors: Campbell, a star of the TV drama “Party of Five”; Cox, enjoying her first flushes of success from “Friends”; and Arquette, a scion of a family of character actors. Three sequels bonded them for life, and Cox and Arquette fell in love and got married.

But following “Scream 4” in 2011, the series seemed to grow tired. By then, Cox and Arquette had separated and would later divorce; Craven died in 2015. A “Scream” TV series only loosely connected to the movies ran for three years on MTV and VH1 but gained little cultural traction.

Now, after a decade-long absence from theaters, a new “Scream” — with no numerals or subtitles, from new directors and new screenwriters — will be released on Jan. 14. It is both a reboot and a sequel, introducing new characters (played by Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, Jack Quaid and others) to an audience equally accustomed to franchise do-overs like “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and art-house horror films like “The Babadook” and “Midsommar.”
The latest “Scream” also brings back Campbell, Cox and Arquette as the founding characters, who have grown well into adulthood and been altered in different ways by their past encounters with the various Ghostface killers. For the actors, the proposition of returning to “Scream” is, well, a double-edged one: a chance to rekindle old connections and remember what made the previous films great — tempered by the fear that they will squander the series’ legacy if they cannot duplicate past glories.
When she was approached about the new movie, Cox said, “I was really like, What? They want to do another ‘Scream’?” But as she considered it further, she thought, “Why not go back to something that was such a huge part of my life and play a character that was fun? They must have a real vision for this if they want to bring back the franchise and take the risk.”
As they spoke in a video interview at the end of November — Campbell and Cox together in one window, Arquette by himself in another — the actors shared a tentative intimacy, like old classmates encountering each other at a high school reunion. They traded goofy laughs as each claimed to have forgotten key details about the past “Scream” films and made self-deprecating jokes about their accomplishments.
Asked how she was hired, Cox said her manager suggested her. Or: “It could be that my manager said, ‘She’s not that good and I don’t think you should hire her.’ But who knows?”

What they agreed on about the first film was the brilliance of Williamson’s convention-busting script and their admiration for Craven, who previously made seminal horror movies like “The Last House on the Left” and “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” The cast was largely shielded from behind-the-scenes conflicts between him and Dimension Films, which produced the original “Scream” series and had reservations about Craven’s work on the first movie. Campbell said of the director, “He was very gentle and kind and quiet.”

“Scream” withstood a fourth-place opening weekend in December 1996, overshadowed by the animated hit “Beavis and Butt-head Do America.” Several days later, Campbell got a call from her agents. “I thought, Uh-oh, something’s wrong,” she recalled. “And they said, ‘It’s at $30 million.’” Her voice dropped to a whisper: “I was like, ‘Is that bad?’” In fact, the film would run until the summer and gross more than $100 million in the United States alone.
A sequel was already in production and released in December 1997. (“It was college next, wasn’t it?” Campbell asked. “You went to college,” Arquette affirmed.) “Scream 3” followed quickly in 2000, adding more layers of metacommentary as the characters’ brushes with death continue to inspire a hastily made movie-franchise-within-a-franchise called “Stab.”
With each entry, the “Scream” stars said, they never felt the pressure was on them to sustain the overall quality of the series. “In television, when I go out and do something new, it’s petrifying,” Cox said. “You feel nothing can live up to what you’ve done before. But in movies, we get the script and come to play our characters.”
But Williamson said that “Scream 4” left him and Craven feeling burned out. “The studio was second-guessing themselves and kept giving note after note after note,” the writer said. “I finally was like, ‘Guys, I don’t know what I’m writing anymore — I’m just typing.’”

After Craven’s death, he said, “in my heart, it was over. Without Wes, I didn’t think there would be a ‘Scream.’”
Years went by, and the Weinstein Company, which owned Dimension Films, collapsed after its co-founder Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault and harassment by numerous women. (He has since been convicted and sentenced for sex crimes and faces further charges.)
The rights for “Scream” were eventually acquired by Spyglass Media Group, which partnered with Paramount to produce a new entry written by James Vanderbilt (“Zodiac”) and Guy Busick (“Ready or Not”) and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett of the filmmaking group Radio Silence (“Ready or Not,” “V/H/S”).
Williamson, an executive producer on the new “Scream,” said that the project had his blessing. “My first thought was, Wait, they’re not going to ask me to write it? How dare they,” he said with a laugh. But after hearing the creative team’s plans for the film, he said, “They had it all figured out. I’m like, ‘OK, this works.’”
Naturally, this “Scream” sees another Ghostface once again plaguing the fictional California town of Woodsboro, requiring the return of Sidney, Gale and Dewey. But bringing back the actors who played them was hardly a certainty.
The biggest obstacle, they said, was the absence of Craven: “I don’t see how that happens — emotionally but also practically,” said Campbell. “Who’s going to do it as well as Wes?”

But one by one, the actors were placated by the film’s directors, who wrote them letters praising their past work and urging their involvement.

“It was weirdly the easiest and the hardest thing to do,” Gillett said. “It’s so easy to express our admiration for them as actors and for Wes and his work.” The challenge, he said, was that “there was a lot on the line and a lot of pressure.”
Bettinelli-Olpin said that, for example, in the letter they wrote to Campbell, “it was like, this movie doesn’t exist without you, full stop. We’re not trying to make it any other way.” (Asked what would have happened if any of the actors had declined, Gillett said, “We said that there would be a plan and then never explored what said plans were.”)
Williamson said he also had a conversation with Campbell while she was considering the film. “I don’t think this is her favorite genre to watch,” he said. “But she wanted my viewpoint and I told her the truth — I didn’t want to be part of it, and then I couldn’t imagine it happening without me.”

The invitation was particularly delicate for Arquette and Cox, who were asked to act out a story in which their “Scream” characters have split up, in circumstances mirroring the couple’s real life.
Outside the “Scream” films, Cox and Arquette continue to co-parent their 17-year-old daughter, Coco, and to share a personal shorthand. At one point in the video interview, when Arquette’s audio was garbled by a digital glitch, Cox joked, “It’s been so long, I can’t understand him anymore.” Arquette chuckled and replied, “I’m sorry, I’m mumbling.”
Asked if she hesitated to take the film because of its personal parallels, Cox answered, “I had no apprehensions. I was just so happy to be working with both of them.”
But Arquette acknowledged that being in a movie with Cox again was inherently awkward. “It’s been 25 years of our lives,” he said. “We’ve grown up together. We have a child together.” He explained, however, that he could not pass it up: “It’s a cathartic experience to just be able to act opposite Courteney.”
When the cameras rolled on their first scene together, it was a tearful moment, and not just because the script called for it. Cox said of Arquette, “He got very emotional while he was filming it. He said the next day the crew didn’t look at him.”
By way of explanation, Arquette gamely acted out the process of ripping out his still-beating heart and holding it in his hands. “I could tell some people aren’t comfortable with that level of emotion,” he said.

Arquette, who also provided the directors with some personal photographs of himself and Cox that were used in the movie, said the “Scream” shoot was often a moving experience for him.
“There were moments when I felt Wes’s spirit around a lot. There would be a wind blowing and I’d see Courteney’s hair move back. And then it’s just like” — he made an exaggeratedly mournful weeping noise. “It made it really easy to tap into those feelings,” he said.
There will of course be conversations about further entries if this “Scream” hits its targets, but for now, its veteran leads are satisfied to have carried their characters to the quarter-century mark.
Campbell said she was grateful to have played a horror-movie protagonist who is never depicted as a helpless victim. “I’m very lucky, as a woman, to have gotten a role where people come up to me and say, ‘Sidney Prescott inspired me — Sidney Prescott made me more courageous, made me less insecure, made me stand up for myself,’” she said.
Cox preferred to draw more pragmatic lessons from her “Scream” experience and the shifting identities of the people who have donned its telltale mask in each installment.
“There’s a deeper meaning to the fact that anybody could be Ghostface,” she said. “What it’s taught me is that you don’t go into a parking lot, ever, at night. You don’t go to the bathroom in a movie theater. And anybody could go off the deep end.”"

Justice Charles D. Wood has issued an ominous ruling that is clearly breaking with the tradition of a free press that has been established law stemming from the Pentagon Papers case.
In this current case there is not even a hint of a national security breach, yet the judge has allowed Project Veritas to stop The Times from publishing the organization’s memos. We should all be up in arms at what this means to the future of a free press. Only the most sensitive information that could endanger the country should be considered under prior restraint. This case most certainly doesn’t rise to that bar.
Given its name, Project Veritas, it is ironic that the organization is intent on preventing the truth from being printed. But truth may not be its goal.

The notion that journalists should be the arbiters of what to publish and when ignores the importance of the attorney-client privilege for purely selfish reasons, improperly cloaked in First Amendment jurisprudence. Justice Charles D. Wood’s decision should be affirmed by the Appellate Division.

Re “Bonds and Clemens Belong in Cooperstown,” by Jeff Novitzky (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 31):
Is there such a thing as an asterisk in the Hall of Fame?
Was our anger at the failings of Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens in part a misplaced disappointment with the system that enabled the use of performance-enhancing drugs and with ourselves for turning a blind eye? Have we done these two a grave injustice?
Or is the hubris of possibly the two greatest players of their day, maybe of any day, the ultimate basis for denying them entry into the pantheon?
I have struggled to reach my own conclusion, as I long felt that the Hall of Fame exclusion was the only retribution, the only punishment that fit the crime committed by two men who received adulation and riches while bending the rules of the game. But maybe I now can see that the fault was as much with ourselves as with the stars.
So let me now cast aside my doubts and grievances and cast my vote, with an asterisk, for Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens.

Re “With Biometrics, Your Face Is, or Will Be, Your Boarding Pass” (Travel, Dec. 24):
We shouldn’t be so quick to accept the argument that biometrics are “the future.” While the technology may serve the interests of the Transportation Security Administration and the airlines — large bureaucracies that process people on an industrial scale — it’s far less clear that they serve the full interests of individuals.
Biometrics, especially face recognition, allow people to be recognized and tracked en masse not only at the airport but outside it as well. They lead to racially disparate arrests and threaten to chill our freedoms through the total loss of anonymity in public. Cheerful assurances that their application will remain voluntary are not to be believed.
As the dangers of face recognition have become increasingly clear, cities and towns across the United States have enacted bans on government use, and major companies like Amazon and Microsoft have halted sales to law enforcement.
There’s nothing inevitable about this technology. The future is ours to create, and that future shouldn’t include mass biometric tracking.

Medina, Ohio"
2022-01-07,"There’s a moment near the end of J.R. Moehringer’s 2005 memoir, “The Tender Bar,” when the author realizes he’s circling the drain. The owner of his favorite bar, Steve, has died an alcoholic’s death, overserving himself, falling, hitting his head and lapsing into a coma. Seeking solace, the young Moehringer, fresh out of Yale, turns to his most seductive companion: booze.
“I no longer made any pretense of drinking to bond with the men, or to blunt the cares of the day, or to participate in male rituals,” Moehringer writes. “I drank to get drunk. I drank because I couldn’t think what else to do. I drank the way Steve drank at the end, to achieve oblivion.”
“The Tender Bar,” which has been adapted as an Amazon Prime movie, directed by George Clooney, isn’t strictly about alcoholism. It’s about community and family and the void left by an absent (alcoholic) father. But Moehringer’s words would make for a standard drunkalogue at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, of which I’ve attended many. “Oblivion” is a popular word there, and a popular destination among alcoholics. This is one of the smartest things about Moehringer’s memoir: It deftly captures that moment when the party comes to an end, when it’s just not fun anymore and it’s time to sink or swim. (Moehringer quit drinking when he was 25.)
But that moment never comes in the movie, mostly because J.R., played by Tye Sheridan, drinks without consequences, as does everyone else at the Long Island watering hole where his bartender uncle, Charlie (Ben Affleck), dispenses words of wisdom with his dry martinis. The closest the movie comes to acknowledging alcoholism is when J.R.’s ne’er-do-well father (Max Martini) enters the picture. A classic deadbeat dad, he disappears for years at a time, shows up to announce his sobriety, but explains that he can actually have the occasional cocktail because he’s not really an alcoholic. Then he beats up his girlfriend. He’s the movie’s designated alcoholic and also its villain.

“He’s somebody who’s making a big deal of his sobriety, and it’s like, ‘I’ve decided I can allow myself a cocktail,’” the “Tender Bar” screenwriter William Monahan said by phone. “Then that cocktail is like 10 million of them, resulting in domestic violence.”
Aside from J.R.’s dad, however, no one in the movie seems to have a drinking problem, despite spending all of their free time at a bar.
“George Clooney didn’t hammer on it,” Monahan said. “But the J.R. character does definitely have a point where he realizes he’s got to straighten up.”
Well, yes and no. In the movie, J.R. comes to Charlie concerned that he’ll end up like his old man. Charlie’s advice: Cut back on the drinking. And that’s that. We don’t see J.R. slam cocktails at Penn Station and pick up a few Budweiser tallboys for the ride to the bar, as he does in the book. Instead, his uncle tells him to cool it a little. Does he heed this advice? We never really find out.

Moehringer, who has gone on to write novels (“Sutton”) and other books (“Open,” with Andre Agassi), sees drinking as an inherently difficult subject to depict in film.

“It’s woven so tightly into the social fabric, and it’s such a central part of many rites and rituals, holidays and special occasions,” he told me via email. “Alcohol can be wonderful, enriching, spirit-enhancing, so it’s hard to think — unpleasant to think — that it can also be dangerous, and sometimes deadly. It doesn’t seem fair, this thing that makes us feel so good can also make us feel so bad. The paradox makes it hard to discuss.”
Yet that paradox has also provided the backbone for enough movies to make the cinema of alcoholism its own genre. Many of these films speak eloquently and thoughtfully to essential traits of the disease, from self-loathing to fundamental dishonesty to ravenous craving.
Some of these movies are quite recent. For instance, “Flight,” the 2012 film starring Denzel Washington as an alcoholic pilot who pulls off a daredevil landing while under the influence, is about the ease with which alcoholics lie to themselves and everyone else. Others belong to classic Hollywood. “The Lost Weekend” (1945) tells the terrifying story of a hopeless drunk futilely fighting the all-consuming obsession with drinking that defines alcoholism. These are brave films that cut to the quick of alcoholism’s cost.
Some of these themes emerge in Moehringer’s book, which takes care to spotlight the good, the bad and the ugly parts of life on a barstool, even if it isn’t specifically about alcoholism. But the movie doesn’t even bother to separate one of Moehringer’s barflies from another. They are, for the most part, mere faces in the crowd, even when they speak a line here and there. The book makes clear that Moehringer loved these guys. On the screen they barely even exist.
This is unfortunate. The people in a bar give the place character, even when they make you want to turn away, like the regular in the book who chokes J.R. half to death just because he’s sick of hearing him talk. Tender bars have blowhards who need to tell you about all the cool stuff they plan to do, and drunks who delight in telling you how drunk you are. Bars have personalities. Those personalities don’t have to be tragic, but sometimes, say in Steve’s case, they are.

“The Tender Bar” is a warm, fuzzy little movie, a first sip of a light beer. But for a film with the word “bar” in its title, it contains remarkably little insight about alcohol, where it’s consumed, and what it does.
It is quite tender. But it could use a little toughness."

2022-01-10,"Google wrongly claimed attorney-client privilege to protect documents subpoenaed in a National Labor Relations Board case filed by former employees who say the company fired them because of their unionization efforts, a labor judge has ruled.
The administrative law judge, Paul Bogas, whom the N.L.R.B. appointed as a special master to review the documents, said in a report on Friday that “this broad assertion is, to put it charitably, an overreach.”
The ruling is the latest legal blow to Google’s defense against a complaint, brought by the labor agency in December 2020, that said the company illegally fired and surveilled employees who were involved in labor organizing.
A Google spokeswoman, Jennifer Rodstrom, said in a statement on Monday that the matter had nothing to do with unionization but was about employees breaching security protocols. “We disagree with the characterization of the legally privileged materials referred to by the complainants,” she said.

Judge Bogas ruled in November that Google had improperly characterized 71 of 80 documents sought by the former employees as privileged. The latest report covers around 200 additional documents pertaining to communications around Google’s hiring of IRI Consultants, a firm known for its anti-union work, as part of Project Vivian, an effort to fight labor organizing at the company.
Google must hand over nearly all of those 200 documents, Judge Bogas ruled. He also ordered the company to produce for his review more than 1,000 additional documents that it logged as privileged.
Google’s argument that it had the right to withhold the documents was not “persuasive,” Judge Bogas said, because IRI assisted Google with messaging that did not include legal advice.
In one document that the judge said did not pass muster for confidentiality, a Google lawyer explained that the company wanted consulting help for Project Vivian “to engage employees more positively and convince them that unions suck.” The lawyer provided a long list of areas where IRI could help, including “understanding the current sentiment around labor organizing/unionization efforts at Google.” The lawyer did not mention assistance with legal help.
In another document that Google claimed was privileged, a different Google lawyer offered public relations advice but not legal counsel. The lawyer proposed that the company find a “respected voice” to publish an editorial about what a union would look like in a tech workplace to discourage employees of Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Google from forming one. A human resources director said that she supported the idea, but that it needed to be done without Google’s fingerprints. IRI then sent a proposed editorial to the Google lawyer.

Judge Bogas also chastised Google for marking documents as privileged just because it copied in a company lawyer, even though the communication did not seek legal advice.
“A company cannot cloak a document in privilege merely by providing a copy to counsel,” the judge wrote.
The New York Times reported earlier that Google encouraged employees to aggressively mark internal communication as “A/C Priv,” which is shorthand for “attorney-client privilege,” in the subject line even if they are not seeking legal advice.
Google denied that was the case, and said it informed employees that they should do that only when appropriate."
2022-01-11,"Amazon workers in Alabama will have another shot at voting to form a union this winter, as the National Labor Relations Board scheduled a mail-in election to start Feb. 4.
The agency told the workers on Tuesday that they will have until March 25 to submit their votes. The agency will count the ballots on March 28.
Workers at an Amazon warehouse near Birmingham, known as BHM1, had voted against forming a union last spring after a highly contentious and public campaign. The labor agency threw out the results after finding that Amazon improperly interfered with the election, opening the door for a new vote.
The agency told the workers on Tuesday that in the original vote, Amazon had “interfered with the employees’ exercise of a free and reasoned choice” by having a mailbox installed at the warehouse, “creating the appearance of irregularity,” and polling workers about their opinion. Amazon, which has said the mailbox was intended to make voting easier, has not appealed the decision to rerun the election.

The prominent organizing effort has been run by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. It has drawn national attention from politicians and other figures as it aims to form the first union at one of the nation's largest employers.
Barbara Agrait, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement that Amazon’s “employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join.” She added that the company looked forward to the workers “having their voices heard again.”
The union said in a statement that it had asked the agency to provide “a number of remedies that could have made the process fairer to workers” in the new election, but that the agency did not approve their requests. “We are deeply concerned that the decision fails to adequately prevent Amazon from continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election,” the union said.
The company, which has vowed to become “Earth’s best employer,” is facing labor pressure on multiple fronts. It has said it would spend $4 billion in the holiday quarter alone to deal with labor shortages. Workers in Staten Island are also trying to unionize, and last month Amazon and the labor board signed an unusually broad nationwide settlement giving workers more power to organize."

If you work for the right company, getting a coronavirus test isn’t difficult.

What testing shortage?
As the Omicron variant of the coronavirus surges across the country, tests are in short supply. But for a select group of employees at corporate America’s largest firms, tests are free and often readily available. These companies have been buying tests in bulk, some as part of their return-to-office protocols and others as a perk to offer workers peace of mind — even for those not yet coming into the office.
Unlike other company perks, like free snacks, virus tests are a vital public health tool. Some large corporations are sending out free weekly shipments to employees, while other businesses, like small restaurants, are struggling to safely stay open. Tests, like personal protective equipment and vaccines, have become the latest example of how a means to manage the coronavirus crisis can aggravate social and economic inequality.
The federal government has been slow to authorize rapid antigen tests, because it has held them to a high standard. (Other places, like Britain, were quicker to approve rapid tests as a public health tool, leading to faster production.) And unlike Washington’s approach to vaccines, the development of rapid tests has mostly been financed by private companies like Abbott. These companies, naturally, base manufacturing on projected profits. Abbott’s C.E.O. said last year that the company underestimated demand.
The result is a testing shortage, and a decentralized system in which schools, hospitals — and companies — are competing to get tests. “It doesn’t surprise me that many organizations who were recognizing they need these tests to stay in business were buying them,” said Joseph Allen, an associate professor at Harvard. “A smart testing strategy would have flooded the market with these, so they don’t have to be hoarded.” With testing kits scarce, some health experts are questioning the distribution of tests to white-collar employees who work from home.

The testing perks at big companies take many forms: Google will send its full-time employees in the U.S. free at-home Cue Health tests that retail for more than $70 each. BlackRock offers tele-health supervision as employees self-administer rapid tests for international travel (an option it began over the December holidays). TIAA has offered free at-home testing since late 2020, even though the majority of its employees have been working from home.
For others, it’s a tougher go: “We’re the epicenter of the epicenter, and I can’t get test kits anywhere,” said Thomas Grech, president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce.

The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
The U.S. may limit Medicare coverage of the contentious Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm. Government officials proposed paying for the expensive treatment’s use only for patients in approved clinical trials, a decision that could sharply curtail its reach.

The F.T.C.’s case against Meta becomes a reality
The Federal Trade Commission has made a breakthrough in its efforts to rein in Big Tech. Yesterday, a federal judge allowed most of the government’s refiled antitrust lawsuit against Facebook — now Meta — to proceed.

Only part of the case can go ahead. Judge James Boasberg, who last year threw out the F.T.C.’s initial case, said the agency’s latest claim that Facebook abused its monopoly power through “buy-or-bury” acquisitions was “far more robust and detailed than before.” But the judge said the agency’s case on Facebook’s management of third parties from its platform lacked enough evidence to go forward.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The F.T.C. has to prove that Facebook hurts customers, not just competitors, the judge said. That could give Facebook the upper hand in the case, because harm is usually described as higher prices, and Meta doesn’t directly charge the users of Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp. But Jason Klint, who heads Digital Content Next and is an expert on antitrust and data issues, said the judge also noted that if the government was able to show that Facebook harmed the “competitive process,” that would most likely prove, by extension, that it harmed consumers.
But the F.T.C.’s case is largely about the past, said the tech journalist Casey Newton. The agency claims that Facebook used the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to stifle competition. But those acquisitions happened in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Absent from the case are more recent acquisitions in the V.R. space. And in the time the government took to refile its case, Newton noted, TikTok has done more damage to Facebook’s social media dominance than the government is likely to do. Still, the F.T.C.’s case puts Meta on notice.

Mnuchin’s mail and the digital dollar
This time last year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was the target of the crypto industry’s ire for rules proposed in the Trump administration’s final days. The “midnight rule-making” incited a resistance movement, with industry groups generating a flood of comments from the public.
Now a CoinDesk investigation of hundreds of pages of Mnuchin’s communications reveal that, though he ignored or diverted many industry communications on the new rules, digital assets came up early and pretty often during the Trump administration.
“The emails show a lot of internal deliberations,” CoinDesk’s managing editor for global policy and regulation, Nikhilesh De, told DealBook. That includes an “ahead of the curve” 2018 message to Mnuchin from Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s adviser and son-in-law. “Really early on,” De notes, before most policymakers were talking about central bank digital currencies, or C.B.D.C.s, Kushner suggested a meeting to consider a digital dollar.

“My sense is it could make sense,” Kushner wrote of a C.B.D.C. Whether a meeting with Mnuchin took place is unclear. In 2019, China became intent on creating a digital yuan and C.B.D.C.s were something other governments could no longer ignore. Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, said yesterday that a report on a digital dollar promised in the fall would be out in weeks. Meanwhile, China’s digital yuan wallet recently became one of the country’s most downloaded apps within a week of release.
The Biden administration has been more active on digital assets, and seemingly more responsive to the industry. Mnuchin ignored many pleas, CoinDesk found, whereas the burgeoning crypto lobbying contingent in Washington is now getting through, pushing policy proposals in meetings with Biden administration officials and other leaders around the world.

2022-01-13,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers, dealing a blow to a key element of the White House’s plan to address the pandemic as coronavirus cases resulting from the Omicron variant are on the rise.
But in a modest victory for President Biden, the court allowed a more limited mandate requiring health care workers at facilities receiving federal money to be vaccinated.
The vote in the employer mandate case was 6 to 3, with the liberal justices in dissent. The vote in the health care case was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh joining the liberal justices to form a majority.
The employer decision undercut one of President Biden’s most significant attempts to tame the virus and left the country with a patchwork of state laws and policies, largely leaving companies and businesses on their own.

The president welcomed the ruling in his favor, saying in a statement that it would save the lives of health care workers and patients. But he said he was disappointed that the court had overturned the employer mandate, which he said was “grounded squarely in both science and the law.”
In both the employer and health worker cases, the justices explored whether Congress had authorized the executive branch to take sweeping actions to address the health care crisis.
The unsigned majority opinion in the employer case said a statute on workplace hazards did not justify a mandate that would have required more than 80 million workers to be vaccinated against the coronavirus or to wear masks and be tested weekly. It also stressed the novelty and sweep of the mandate issued by the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, saying Congress had not authorized the agency to act and describing its response as “a blunt instrument.”
The mandate “draws no distinctions based on industry or risk of exposure to Covid-19,” the majority opinion said, adding that it was “a significant encroachment into the lives — and health — of a vast number of employees.”
But the opinion said more tailored regulations may be lawful given that “most lifeguards and linemen face the same regulations as do medics and meatpackers.”

In a dissenting opinion, Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan expressed incredulity at the court’s willingness to frustrate “the federal government’s ability to counter the unparalleled threat that Covid-19 poses to our nation’s workers.”
Regulating safety in the workplace, the three dissenting justices wrote, is precisely what OSHA is commanded to do.
They agreed that the key issue in the case was that of institutional competence to address the health care crisis.
“Underlying everything else in this dispute,” they wrote, “is a single, simple question: Who decides how much protection, and of what kind, American workers need from Covid-19? An agency with expertise in workplace health and safety, acting as Congress and the president authorized? Or a court, lacking any knowledge of how to safeguard workplaces, and insulated from responsibility for any damage it causes?”

The wiser course, they wrote, would have been to defer to OSHA.
“In the face of a still-raging pandemic, this court tells the agency charged with protecting worker safety that it may not do so in all the workplaces needed,” the dissenters wrote of the majority’s actions in the case, National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor, No. 21A244. “As disease and death continue to mount, this court tells the agency that it cannot respond in the most effective way possible.”

OSHA issued the mandate in November, making exceptions for workers with religious objections and those who do not come into close contact with other people at their jobs. The administration estimated that it would cause 22 million people to get vaccinated and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations.
The ruling means that companies across the country must now decide between protecting employees, potentially losing staff members resistant to complying and running afoul of patchwork regulations.
Several major companies, like United Airlines and Tyson Foods, already have mandates, while others had held back and waited for legal battles to be resolved. Some companies have been anxious about losing employees at a time when workers are already scarce. While firms with mandates have said those worries largely have not come to fruition, a national requirement could have helped ease those concerns.
Walmart, Amazon and JPMorgan Chase, three of the largest employers in the United States, have yet to issue broad requirements for their workers. Some companies that have waited have cited concerns about the costs of setting up testing programs and pushback from unvaccinated employees.
That second mandate applies to workers at hospitals and other health care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Federal judges in Missouri and Louisiana had blocked the requirement, which has exemptions for people with medical or religious objections, in rulings that applied in about half of the states. It will now go into effect nationwide.
In an unsigned opinion in the case, Biden v. Missouri, No. 21A240, the majority wrote that the health care mandate issued by the secretary of health and human services “falls within the authorities that Congress has conferred upon him.”
The governing statute gives the secretary the general power to issue regulations to ensure the “efficient administration” of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and parts of the statute concerning various kinds of facilities generally also authorize the secretary to impose requirements to protect the health and safety of patients.
The majority wrote that the mandate “fits neatly within the language of the statute.”
The majority added that facilities that receive money from the Medicare and Medicaid programs must comply with many federal health and safety requirements.
“All this is perhaps why health care workers and public health organizations overwhelmingly support the secretary’s rule,” the majority wrote. “Indeed, their support suggests that a vaccination requirement under these circumstances is a straightforward and predictable example of the ‘health and safety’ regulations that Congress has authorized the secretary to impose.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, wrote that “scattered provisions” in the statute did not justify the mandate.
Without “exceedingly clear” congressional authorization, Justice Thomas wrote, the federal government should not be allowed to force health care workers “to choose between losing their livelihoods and acquiescing to a vaccine they have rejected for months.”
“These cases are not about the efficacy or importance of Covid-19 vaccines,” he wrote. “They are only about whether” the agency “has the statutory authority to force health care workers, by coercing their employers, to undergo a medical procedure they do not want and cannot undo.”
The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld state vaccine mandates in a variety of settings against constitutional challenges. The two cases decided on Thursday concerned a different question, that of whether Congress has authorized the executive branch to institute the requirements.
The majority opinion in the case on health care workers seemed to try to harmonize the two rulings.
“The challenges posed by a global pandemic do not allow a federal agency to exercise power that Congress has not conferred upon it,” the opinion said. “At the same time, such unprecedented circumstances provide no grounds for limiting the exercise of authorities the agency has long been recognized to have.”
Emma Goldberg and Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting."
2022-01-14,"When the Supreme Court justices emerged from the red drapes at the front of the courtroom last Friday and took their seats — to hear arguments about President Biden’s vaccine mandate — all but one of the justices there were wearing masks. The exception was Neil Gorsuch.
That Gorsuch would resist mask wearing is no surprise. He is a conservative judge with a libertarian streak who has spent his life around Republican politics. In conservative circles, masks have become a symbol of big-government subjugation.
But his decision not to wear one — while the other Republican appointees on the court all were — still felt surprising. The justices usually make an effort to treat one another respectfully. They disagree on the law, sometimes harshly, while maintaining productive and even warm relationships, like the famous friendship between Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
“When you’re charged with working together for most of the remainder of your life, you have to create a relationship,” Sonia Sotomayor said a few years ago, describing her welcoming of Brett Kavanaugh. “This is our work family.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Gorsuch had to know that his masklessness could make other justices uncomfortable, including the 83-year-old Stephen Breyer and the 67-year-old Sotomayor, who has diabetes, a Covid risk factor. Sotomayor sits next to Gorsuch on the bench and, notably, chose not to attend Friday’s argument in person. She participated remotely, from her chambers.
When Ruth Marcus of The Washington Post asked a Supreme Court spokesperson whether Sotomayor had done so because Gorsuch was maskless, Marcus got no response.
One of the few public comments from somebody close to Gorsuch came from Mike Davis, a conservative activist and former Gorsuch clerk. On Twitter, Davis defended his former boss by writing, “We know cloth masks don’t [work].” It was a statement that managed to be both exaggerated and beside the point.
Masks, especially medical masks like KN95 and N95 masks, reduce the spread of Covid, studies show. In response to that evidence, the Supreme Court tells lawyers and reporters in the courtroom to wear medical masks.
The effect of masks may not be as large as their advocates sometimes claim, and masks can impede communication. So I recognize that well-meaning people can disagree about when they should be worn. Still, Gorsuch’s lack of a mask inside the courtroom seemed needlessly risky and disdainful of his colleagues.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Wearing a mask is the decent thing to do,” Marcus wrote in her Washington Post column, “especially when you are around vulnerable individuals.” This week, Gorsuch again appeared without a mask at the court.
His decision seems emblematic of a country where partisan loyalty can trump Covid reality. It also seems emblematic of a court on which the justices are increasingly willing to behave as partisan actors rather than impartial judges.
And if you’re a liberal reader who’s tempted to believe that those descriptions apply only to Republicans — or a conservative reader who’s frustrated that I have focused on Gorsuch — I hope you will read the rest of today’s newsletter.

‘Wildly incorrect’
During the first hour of last Friday’s two-hour argument, Sotomayor listed the evidence of Covid’s continuing threat, to illustrate the benefits of a vaccine mandate. (Yesterday, the court ruled in the case, blocking Biden’s vaccine mandate for large employers, while allowing a narrower one for health care providers. Gorsuch opposed both mandates, while Sotomayor favored both.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In making the case for mandates last week, Sotomayor first noted that Covid cases were surging and hospitals were near capacity. She then turned her attention to children: “We have over 100,000 children, which we’ve never had before, in serious condition and many on ventilators.”
More on Covid-19
Vaccine Side Effects: All vaccines have at least occasional side effects, but thousands of Americans who say they were injured by Covid vaccines believe their cases have been ignored.
Airborne Diseases, Redefined: After a drawn-out global controversy over the coronavirus, the W.H.O. has updated its classification of how pathogens spread through the air.
Four Years Later: Covid was declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020, a moment that changed the world. But even as the threat has faded, the pandemic has reshaped life for many Americans.
That last sentence is simply untrue.
PolitiFact called it “way off.” Khaya Himmelman of The Dispatch described it as false and misleading. Daniel Dale of CNN wrote that Sotomayor had made “a significant false claim.” Glenn Kessler, The Washington Post’s fact checker, called it “wildly incorrect.”
Fewer than 5,000 U.S. children were in the hospital with Covid last week, and many fewer were in “serious condition” or on ventilators. Some of the hospitalized children probably had incidental cases of the virus, meaning they had been hospitalized for other reasons and tested positive while there.
Covid, as regular Morning readers have heard before, is overwhelmingly mild in children, even those who are unvaccinated. The risks are not zero, and they have risen during the current wave of infections, especially for children with major underlying health problems. But the risks remain extremely low.
Consider these numbers: Over the past week, about 870 children were admitted to hospitals with Covid, according to the C.D.C. By comparison, more than 5,000 children visit emergency rooms each week for sports injuries. More than 1,000 are hospitalized for bronchiolitis during a typical January week.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Similarly, the risk of Covid hospitalization for children — even in recent weeks — has been much lower than the risk from the respiratory virus known as R.S.V., as the epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina has shown.
Or consider this: Vaccinated elderly people are at much more risk of severe Covid illness than unvaccinated children.
Sotomayor’s statement may not have been central to the case. But it was not a random error, either. Many other Americans on the left half of the political spectrum have also been exaggerating Covid’s risks to children. As the authors of a Gallup poll last year wrote, “Republicans consistently underestimate risks, while Democrats consistently overestimate them.”
I understand that these exaggerations often stem from an admirable desire to protect children from harm. But the result has been the opposite: The pandemic’s disruptions have led to lost learning, social isolation and widespread mental-health problems for children. Many American children are in crisis — as a result of pandemic restrictions rather than the virus itself.
Last week’s Supreme Court session was striking because it highlighted both halves of the country’s partisan-based self-deceptions. Many conservatives are refusing to wear masks — or, even worse, refusing to be vaccinated — out of a misplaced belief that Covid is harmless. Many liberals are sensationalizing Covid’s risks out of a misplaced belief that it presents a bigger threat to most children and vaccinated adults than continued isolation and disruption do.

Who will host the Oscars?
The Oscars haven’t had a host since Jimmy Kimmel in 2018. That’s changing this year, organizers announced this week, though they haven’t confirmed who will be stepping into the role.
Hosting the Academy Awards is a tough gig: It’s tricky to achieve the right balance of seriousness and humor in an hourslong broadcast. There have been great hosts, like Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal, and strange ones, like an animated Donald Duck in 1958.
But many have struggled with the job, including seasoned comedians like David Letterman (“the gold standard of Oscar bombing,” The Atlantic wrote), and Hollywood stars like James Franco and Anne Hathaway (a disastrous attempt to attract younger viewers). In 2019, the show went hostless after the comedian Kevin Hart dropped out amid backlash over his past homophobic tweets.
The ideal host is a star with mass appeal who can help boost the show’s ratings, which reached an all-time low in 2021. Organizers are apparently considering Tom Holland, who starred in “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” The Hollywood Reporter writes. Award nominations will be out on Feb. 8, and the ceremony will air on March 27. — Sanam Yar, a Morning writer

2022-01-16,"Joe Biden was Barack Obama’s vice president. His Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, was Obama’s pick to lead the Federal Reserve. The director of Biden’s National Economic Council, Brian Deese, was deputy director of Obama’s National Economic Council. His chief of staff, Ron Klain, was his chief of staff for the first two years of the Obama administration and then Obama’s top Ebola adviser. And so on.
The familiar names and faces can obscure how different the new administration, in practice, has become. The problems Biden is facing are an almost perfect inversion of the problems Obama faced. The Obama administration was bedeviled by crises of demand. The Biden administration is struggling with crises of supply.
For years, every conversation I had with Obama administration economists was about how to persuade employers to hire and consumers to spend. The 2009 stimulus was too small, and while we avoided a second Great Depression, we sank into an achingly slow recovery. Democrats carried those lessons into the Covid pandemic. They met the crisis with overwhelming fiscal force, joining with the Trump administration to pass the $2.2 trillion CARES Act and then adding the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill and the assorted Build Back Better proposals on top. They made clear that they preferred the risks of a hot economy, like inflation, to the threat of mass joblessness.
“We want to get something economists call full employment,” Biden said in May. “Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, we want employers to compete with each other to attract work.”

That they have largely succeeded feels like the best-kept secret in Washington. A year ago, forecasters expected unemployment to be nearly 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021. Instead, it fell to 3.9 percent in December, driven by the largest one-year drop in unemployment in American history. Wages are high, new businesses are forming at record rates, and poverty has fallen below its prepandemic levels. Since March 2020, Americans saved at least $2 trillion more than expected. And that’s not just a function of the rich getting richer: a JPMorgan Chase analysis found the median household’s checking account balance was 50 percent higher in July 2021 than in the months before the pandemic.

It is easy to imagine the wan recovery we could’ve had if the mistakes of 2009 and 2010 had been repeated. Instead, we met the pandemic with tremendous, perhaps excessive, fiscal force. We fought the recession and won. The problems we do have shouldn’t obscure the problems we don’t.
But we do have problems. Year-on-year inflation is running at 7 percent, its highest rate in decades, and Omicron has shown that the Biden administration wasted months of possible preparation. It is not to blame for the new variant, but it is to blame for the paucity of tests, effective masks and ventilation upgrades.
The conversations I have with the Biden administration’s economists are very different from the conversations I had with the Obama administration’s economists, even when they’re the same people. Now the discussion is all about what the economy can produce and how fast it can be shipped. They need companies to make more goods and make them faster. They need more chips so there can be more cars and computers. They need ports to clear more shipments and Pfizer to make more antiviral pills and shipping companies to hire more truckers and schools to upgrade their ventilation systems.
Some of these problems reflect the Biden administration’s successes. (Read my colleague Paul Krugman for more on this.) For all the talk of supply chain crises, many of the delays and shortages reflect unexpectedly strong demand, not a pandemic-induced breakdown in production. Supply chains are built to produce the goods that companies think will be consumed in the future. Expectations were off for 2021, in part because forecasters thought demand would slacken as people lost work and wages, in part because the fiscal response was massively larger than anyone anticipated and in part because when people couldn’t go out for meals and movies, they bought things instead. Overall spending is more or less on its prepandemic trend, but the composition of spending has changed: Americans purchased 18 percent more physical goods in September 2021 than in February 2020.

Now the Biden administration fears that its supply problems will wipe out its demand successes. In recent remarks, Biden took aim at those who would lower prices by breaking the buying power of the working class. “If car prices are too high right now, there are two solutions,” Biden said. “You increase the supply of cars by making more of them, or you reduce demand for cars by making Americans poorer. That’s the choice. Believe it or not, there’s a lot of people in the second camp.”
He’s right, but this is a practical fight, not just an ideological one, and the Biden administration is making its own mistakes. His administration is suffering right now from directly mismanaging Covid supplies. It did an extraordinary job in its first months, flooding the country with vaccines. Today, any adult who wants one, or three, can get the shots. But vaccines aren’t the only public health tool that matters, and there was every reason to believe the Biden administration knew it. The American Rescue Plan had about $20 billion for vaccine distribution, but it had $50 billion to expand testing and even more than that to retrofit classrooms so teachers and children alike would feel safe. Where did that money go?
Getting the pandemic supply chain right would help ease every other supply chain, too. If Americans could move about their lives more confidently, they could buy services instead of things, and if companies could test and protect their work forces more effectively, they could produce and ship more goods.
But the Biden administration hasn’t fully embraced its role as an economic planner. When Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, was asked about testing shortages in December, she shot back, “Should we just send one to every American?”
Psaki’s snark soon became Biden’s policy. The administration is launching a website where any family can request four free tests. That’s a start, but no more than that. For rapid testing to work, people need to be able to do it constantly. But because the administration didn’t create the supply of tests it needed months ago, there aren’t enough tests for it or anyone else to buy now. Part of this reflects the ongoing failure of the Food and Drug Administration to approve many of the tests already being sold in Europe.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The same is true, I’d argue, about masks. There’s simply no reason every American can’t pick up an unlimited supply of N95s and KN95s at every post office, library and D.M.V. Instead, people are buying counterfeit N95s on Amazon and wearing cloth masks that do far less to arrest spread. Now the Biden administration is moving toward supplying masks. But more needs to be done: How about ventilation? How about building the vaccine production capacity needed to vaccinate the world and prevent future strains from emerging? How about building capacity to produce more antiviral pills so that the next effective treatment can ramp up more quickly?
For decades, Democrats and Republican administrations alike believed the market would manage supply. We live in the wreckage of that worldview. But it held for so long that the U.S. government has lost both the muscle and the confidence needed to manage supply, at least when it comes to anything other than military spending. So Biden’s task now is clear: to build a government that can create supply, not just demand.
This may not be the presidency Biden prepared for, but it’s the one he got.

2022-01-18,"SEATTLE — Microsoft plans to buy the powerhouse but troubled video game company Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion, its biggest deal ever and one that places a major bet that people will be spending more and more time in the digital world.
The blockbuster acquisition, announced on Tuesday, would catapult the company into a leading spot in the $175 billion gaming industry. Games on virtually every kind of device, from bulky consoles to smartphones, have gained even greater popularity during the pandemic. Technology companies are swarming around the industry, looking for a bigger share of attention and money from the world’s three billion gamers.
In an industry driven by big franchises, Activision makes some of the most popular titles, including Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Yet the company has been roiled in recent months by an employee revolt over accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination.
Microsoft framed the deal as strengthening the company’s hand in the so-called metaverse, the nascent world of virtual and augmented reality. The metaverse has attracted huge amounts of investment and talent, though so far is more of a buzzword than a thriving business. Facebook renamed its parent company to Meta late last year to underscore its commitment.

But the focus on the futuristic metaverse belies the significance of the deal in the present: The acquisition helps Microsoft gain on its rival Sony in the long-running battle for gamers’ attentions and wallets by offering top titles. It also helps the software giant stay ahead of powerful newer competitors in gaming, like Amazon and Google.
Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft’s gaming business, said that whatever the metaverse may end up being, “gaming will be at the forefront of making that mainstream.” For now, he said, the acquisition is about gaining a stronghold in mobile gaming, where Microsoft barely competes, and a studio that produces hugely popular games. He called Call of Duty “one of the amazing entertainment franchises on the planet.”
Federal regulators may raise concerns about the acquisition, as Democrats and Republicans alike have pushed to limit the power of technology giants. On Tuesday, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission announced a new effort to broaden how they should determine if deals are anticompetitive.
Microsoft is valued at more than $2.3 trillion, second only to Apple. The takeover of Activision would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony, the company said. Microsoft now makes Xbox consoles and owns studios that produce hits like Minecraft.
The game industry has been consolidating rapidly. A force behind that — and one that could grab the attention of regulators — is the arms race for exclusive content. Microsoft sometimes makes the games it owns available only on its own devices, such as its Xbox console, and unavailable on those made by competitors, like Sony’s PlayStation.

When asked whether Activision games like Call of Duty would become exclusive to Xbox, Mr. Spencer would say only that “our goal is to allow the content to reach as many players as possible.”
Microsoft has been hunting for ways to spend its immense cash reserve — more than $130 billion — to expand its consumer business. It has looked at acquiring the booming social network TikTok and the popular chat app Discord.
In Activision, which faces accusations that senior executives ignored sexual harassment and discrimination, Microsoft found a target under stress. The allegations have weighed on Activision, with its shares falling 27 percent since California sued the company in July over the claims.
The game maker’s shares rose more than 25 percent in trading on Tuesday. Microsoft’s shares fell by 2 percent.

The transaction may be seen as a victory for Bobby Kotick, Activision’s longtime chief executive, whom some critics had sought to force out over the controversy. Mr. Kotick negotiated a big premium for investors — Microsoft is paying $95 a share, roughly 45 percent above his company’s stock price before the announcement, though only slightly more than the trading price before the scandal broke.

Mr. Kotick will stay in his role until the deal is complete. Then the expectation is that he will step down as chief executive, though he could move into an advisory role, according to two people with knowledge of his plans, who would speak only anonymously because the talks were private.
The controversy at Activision began last summer when a California employment agency sued the company over accusations of fostering a toxic workplace culture in which women were routinely sexually harassed and discriminated against. In the ensuing months, employees staged protests, launched social media campaigns and called for executives to resign.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Some top leaders at Activision did leave, including J. Allen Brack, the head of the Blizzard Entertainment subsidiary, and the company pledged $250 million toward increasing employee diversity and said it would strengthen anti-harassment policies. But when The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Mr. Kotick had known for years about accusations of harassment against employees and in some cases had not taken action, calls for his resignation only grew.
Doing a deal with Activision is something of an about-face for Microsoft, which as recently as November was questioning the company’s culture. In an email to Xbox employees that was earlier reported on by Bloomberg and confirmed by the company, Mr. Spencer wrote in November that he was “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at Activision. On Tuesday, he appeared alongside Mr. Kotick to praise the deal, and Mr. Kotick said that he felt the two companies had “similar values and think about our cultures similarly.”

Mr. Spencer said Microsoft “sat down with Bobby and the team and looked at the plan that they have in place,” adding that company culture was always a work in progress. “We are very supportive of the progress that he and the team are making.”
Current and former Activision employees who have been leading the efforts to get the company to reform its culture did not think the purchase was likely to prompt change in the short term, especially because the sale may face a long review from regulators.
The deal could take 12 to 18 months to close, Mr. Spencer said.
“We will continue to fight for improvement and stress proper employee representation,” said Jessica Gonzalez, a former Activision employee and one of the organizers of the ABetterABK activist movement. She added that “this doesn’t change anything.”
Game companies, flush with cash since the pandemic increased the industry’s profits, have been consolidating rapidly. The previous record for the biggest merger in the game industry was set just last week, when Take-Two Interactive, the creator of games like Grand Theft Auto, announced plans to buy the mobile game publisher Zynga for more than $11 billion.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Last year, Electronic Arts and Take-Two engaged in a bidding war over Codemasters, a racing game company that eventually went to EA for $1.2 billion. Microsoft made another splashy purchase in 2020 when it bought ZeniMax Media and its slate of gaming studios for $7.5 billion.
Activision itself was the product of serial deal-making by Mr. Kotick over decades, rolling up smaller game studios. It took shape in its current form when Activision — then known primarily for producing titles for traditional gaming consoles — agreed to combine with the gaming unit of France’s Vivendi to expand into multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft.
Activision later bought King, the European gaming company behind Candy Crush, to expand into mobile games. King produced $1 billion in operating profit during the latest 12-month period.
“Scale truly is a tremendous benefit in the world of gaming,” said Hope Cochran, King’s former chief financial officer, who is now a managing director at Madrona Venture Group. “You want to build a community, and you need enough people to build it.”
Activision’s gaming efforts are facing headwinds. Players panned the most recent Call of Duty release, and releases of titles like Diablo and Overwatch have been delayed. Still, Activision remains quite profitable, reporting $639 million in profit in its most recent quarter.

Mr. Kotick characterized the deal as a calculation that Activision did not have the tools to keep up with big tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Tencent in the rapidly evolving gaming landscape.
“We realized it was going to be an increasingly competitive world with resources that we just didn’t have,” he said.

2022-01-19,"Amazon Prime Video’s long-gestating “Lord of the Rings” series, which will make its debut on the streaming platform in September, officially has a name: “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.”
In addition to revealing the title on Wednesday, Amazon announced that the series would take place thousands of years before the events of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy of films adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien’s novels by the director and producer Peter Jackson.
The streaming series, more than four years in the making, represents the most ambitious effort since Amazon began investing in original programming.
The company bought the rights to “The Lord of the Rings” for more than $200 million in November 2017, when there was a power vacuum in the executive wing of its streaming division. Roy Price, then the head of Amazon Studios, was forced to resign a month before the deal, after a producer had accused him of sexual harassment. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, was involved in the negotiations, Variety reported. (Mr. Bezos, who tweets infrequently, promoted the series in a Twitter post on Wednesday.)

The development of the series has been the responsibility of Jennifer Salke, the executive who took charge of Amazon Studios in February 2018. Ms. Salke tapped J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay to be showrunners of the series in July 2018, and production has been underway in New Zealand, where Mr. Jackson filmed his trilogy.
The showrunners said in a statement that “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” was “a title that we imagine could live on the spine of a book next to J.R.R. Tolkien’s other classics.”"
2022-01-20,"Written and directed by Aimee Long, “A Shot Through the Wall” considers the modern dilemma about race and policing in the United States from the perspective of a Chinese American police officer in New York. When a rookie, Mike Tan (Kenny Leu), chases a teenager through an apartment building in Brooklyn, Mike accidentally fires his gun, killing a Black man.
After the shooting, Mike is seen agonizing over his actions, though his immigrant parents, Chow and May (Tzi Ma and Fiona Fu), are supportive. At work, his superiors assure him everything will blow over — until a video revealing Mike’s identity goes viral, prompting widespread demands for justice and the possibility of a sentence that includes jail time. Mike then seeks the help of a high-powered attorney who encourages him to flaunt his Black girlfriend, Candace (Ciara Renée), to blunt any accusations of racism.
Though attentive to calls for police accountability, and the media’s role in reducing complex issues into simple narratives, Long’s schematic script ramps up theatrics at the expense of more challenging insights.

Nevertheless, the brisk, eventful melodrama has an undeniably absorbing appeal, and the strongest moments in the film occur when Long illuminates Mike’s family life with subtle details about the relationship between two generations of Chinese Americans — as when May’s English is smugly corrected by her daughter.
Alienated and desperate upon realizing the exploitative strategies he needs to perform in order to avoid a conviction, Mike illegally purchases a weapon and betrays his loved ones before coming to his senses. By the final act, however, Long pulls the rug out from under us in a way that implausibly drives home the film’s perfunctory ideas about gun violence, police incompetence and the victimhood of communities of color.

2022-01-21,"Google asked a federal court on Friday to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit led by the State of Texas, the first time it has sought to have one of the government competition cases against it thrown out in the United States.
In a filing, Google said the state had failed to show that it engaged in anticompetitive behavior and hadn’t proved that an agreement between Facebook and Google, a core part of the case, violated the law.
“We’re confident that this case is wrong on the facts and the law, and should be dismissed,” said Adam Cohen, the company’s director of economic policy.
The Texas lawsuit argues that Google has obtained and abused a monopoly over the labyrinthine set of systems that allow publishers to auction off ad space to marketers. The states argue that Google misled publishers and advertisers about the nature of the ad auctions, allowing it to pocket more of the money flowing through its ad systems. And they say the company used a deal with Facebook to maintain its dominance when the publishers tried to develop an alternative system.

“Despite amassing a lengthy collection of grievances, each one comes down to a plea for Google to share its data or to design its products in ways that would help its rivals,” Google said in its filing.
Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, said in a statement: “Google’s motion attributes their monopoly status to pure success on the merits. The company whose motto was once ‘Don’t Be Evil’ now asks the world to examine their egregious monopoly abuses and see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil.”
Google faces pressure from governments around the world. In addition to the lawsuit from Texas and more than a dozen other states, the federal government and a different group of states have sued the company, arguing it has abused a monopoly over online search. On Thursday, a Senate committee endorsed an antitrust law meant to crack down on some of its practices — along with Amazon’s and Apple’s — and European lawmakers in Brussels are considering their own new digital antitrust rules.
Google is also not the first tech giant to try to get a recent government antitrust case dismissed. Last year, Facebook asked a federal court to throw out lawsuits filed against it by the Federal Trade Commission and a collection of states. The judge in the case initially agreed. But the F.T.C. refiled its lawsuit, and the judge said this month that it could move forward. The states have appealed."

What’s Up? (Jan. 16-22)
Microsoft Strikes a Deal
Microsoft on Monday announced plans to buy the video game company Activision Blizzard for almost $70 billion, its biggest deal ever. The company said the acquisition would help it compete in the so-called Metaverse, the nascent virtual world where some technologists believe we’ll soon live second lives. But Microsoft’s more immediate objective is probably to strengthen its gaming platform. Just as Netflix acquires content to compete for streaming viewers’ attention and subscription fees, Microsoft’s purchase of Activision — the maker of popular games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush — may bolster the library of games for Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft’s $10-a-month Netflix-style video game subscription service. The size of the deal, and the possibility that Microsoft could make some popular Activision titles exclusive to its platform, could bring renewed antitrust scrutiny to the company from federal regulators.
A Clash of Technologies
Airlines warned early in the week that a major expansion of fifth generation cellular service planned for Wednesday could disrupt flights. Unlike previous generations of wireless service, 5G technology uses radio frequencies similar to the ones used by the devices pilots depend on to determine a jet’s altitude, and for years, experts have said it could interfere with that equipment. Flight cancellations and chaos were ultimately avoided by a last-minute decision by AT&T and Verizon to restrict 5G service near airports. President Biden said that federal officials would continue to work with wireless companies, airlines and aviation manufacturers to find a “permanent, workable solution.”
Intel Invests in U.S. Chip Making
Intel plans to build a $20 billion chip manufacturing complex in Ohio, a move that has implications for geopolitics and the supply chain. During the pandemic, manufacturing disruptions and labor shortages caused a shortage of chips, which are mostly manufactured in Taiwan. Legislation that passed in the Senate last year would provide $52 billion in subsidies for the chip industry to help the United States compete with China on innovation by expanding its stake in a foundational technology. Intel plans to start construction in Ohio later this year and to begin producing chips there by 2025. Patrick Gelsinger, Intel’s chief executive, has said Intel might invest as much as $100 billion over a decade in its next U.S. manufacturing campus, with the speed and scope of the expansion depending partly on the availability of federal grants.

What’s Next? (Jan. 23-29)
A ‘New Normal’? Maybe.
Some public health experts hope that as the Omicron wave of the coronavirus recedes, the pandemic could become more manageable. What this would mean for the precautions that businesses take to keep their workplaces safe remains unclear, and policies have continued to shift. In a poll of Manhattan businesses employing 215,000 white-collar workers, almost one-quarter said they didn’t know when their offices would reach half their capacity. Businesses in the hospitality industry say they are struggling to decide when workers who test positive for the virus can return to work. And after the Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s mandate for large employers to require vaccines or testing, Starbucks scrapped a plan to make these requirements for its 200,000 workers.

A Big Push for Big Tech Bills
President Biden and other top Democrats have said that reining in Big Tech is a priority, but lawmakers are running out of time before the midterm elections, when Democrats could lose control of Congress. Over the next few months, they plan to push a handful of proposed laws that reduce the power of companies like Amazon, Alphabet and Meta. On Thursday, a Senate committee voted to advance one such bill that would prohibit tech platforms from promoting their own products over those of others. Other legislation aims to strengthen privacy, make it easier to break up the big tech giants, address misinformation and regulate artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. Most have a long shot at passing: Though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle mostly agree that Congress should do something to increase competition in the tech industry, they have different ideas on how to go about it.
The Fed Meets
Fed officials will meet for the first time this year starting on Tuesday, and at the top of the agenda is fighting inflation. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said this month that the economy no longer needed as much help, and with prices continuing to climb at a record pace, economists expect it to raise interest rates three or four times this year. The Fed has also begun winding down its bond-buying program, which it used to stoke growth during the pandemic. In other economic news that will be watched closely this week: The government will announce on Thursday how much the U.S. economy grew in the fourth quarter.

Taylour Paige — so electrifying as the title character of last year’s “Zola” — shines brightly in a very different kind of role, in this wonderful comedy-drama from the writer and director Stella Meghie. Paige stars as Jean, a boho Brooklyn novelist whose career, love life and family seem to implode simultaneously. Sherri Shepherd, Gloria Reuben, Michelle Hurst and Erica Ash co-star as the women of the Jones family, and their dialogue crackles with the text and subtext of these lifelong relationships, with running jokes, passive insults and hidden resentments aplenty. It’s sparklingly funny and breezily executed, and Paige is a tremendous presence, charismatic and likable even when she’s making a mess of things.

This Sundance sensation is a heart-wrenching story of grief, pain, regret and struggle. The director and co-writer Jordana Spiro tells the story of Angel (Dominique Fishback, of “The Deuce” and “Judas and the Black Messiah”), released from jail on the eve of her 18th birthday and torn between getting her life together and finishing the crime that put her there. Spiro adopts a no-nonsense approach, digging into the nuts and bolts of the probationary process and the various ways in which the deck is already stacked against her protagonist; Fishback takes a similar tack, eschewing showy moments for a lived-in authenticity. It’s an unforgettable performance in a quietly powerful movie.

What could have been an exploitative leer-fest or a soppy melodrama is played as neither; Heller respects her protagonist, mistakes and all, and makes her journey one of both self-discovery and self-flagellation.

The perils and quandaries of drone warfare have been pondered by documentary filmmakers and op-ed writers, but this frightening, tightly constructed thriller from the director Gavin Hood (“Rendition”) sifts those questions through the customarily jingoistic lens of the military thriller, with gripping results. Aaron Paul stars as a drone pilot working in concert, and then in conflict, with the icy colonel who’s calling the shots; she’s played, with ferocious precision, by Helen Mirren. Alan Rickman co-stars, in one of his final screen roles, as her superior.
‘Outrage: Way of the Yakuza’ (2011)
Stream it on Amazon.
The writer, director and actor Takeshi Kitano takes another deep dive into the pulpy world of Japanese gangsters, detailing a pair of uneasily aligned crime families and the ins and outs of their various criminal enterprises. The expected double-crosses, bloody betrayals and all-out war ensue, but Kitano’s script wittily pinpoints the conflict’s origins in grievances, slights and grudges; these may be aging men of gravitas and power, but they’re all petty, insecure teenagers at heart. Kitano has been making crime films for so long that he does so with a wink — he uses our expectations to either serve his story or subvert it, both to great effect. The violence is inventive; the dialogue slyly funny. And Kitano’s direction is as stylish as ever.

Before he was trotting the globe in pricey Netflix movies with The Rock and Wonder Woman, Ryan Reynolds was making action films on a much smaller scale — in fact, this ingenious thriller from the director Rodrigo Cortés is about as small as they get. It begins with Reynolds waking up to discover he’s buried alive in a wooden coffin, with only a cellphone and a minimum of supplies, and must figure out how to escape before his oxygen runs out. Not many actors can hold an entire film as the only character onscreen; Reynolds makes his desperation and fear palpable and haunting.
‘Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives’ (2017)
Stream it on Netflix.
A music executive whose unerring ear for stars and hits rarely failed him over half a century, Clive Davis had a hand in the ascendancy of everyone from Aretha Franklin to Bruce Springsteen and Whitney Houston. Chris Perkel’s celebratory documentary is a decidedly hands-on affair; Davis tells much of his own story, and rarely in terms that are anything less than glowing. But what the film lacks in self-reflection, it makes up for in sheer entertainment value. Davis is a marvelous storyteller, spinning his yarn as if he were merely happy to be there, and the music is, unsurprisingly, first-rate.
‘Limelight’ (2011)

The filmmaker Billy Corben (best known for his series of “Cocaine Cowboys” documentaries) directs this profile of Peter Gatien, the colorful New York nightclub impresario behind such iconic ’80s and ’90s venues as Limelight, Palladium and the Tunnel — places where recreational drugs and casual sex were as omnipresent as the thumping dance music. Corben molds his filmmaking to the story he’s telling, instinctively tuning in to the furious energy and fast pace of the period."
2022-01-25,"Scott Conger, the mayor of Jackson, Tenn., campaigned on a modest promise to improve local infrastructure. He planned to build sidewalks, open a senior center and repair the aging storm-water disposal system in his city of 68,000, about halfway between Nashville and Memphis.
But as he begins his fourth year in office, Mr. Conger, 38, has adopted a new favorite cause: cryptocurrencies. He has pledged to give city employees the option of converting their paychecks into Bitcoin and has outlined plans to install a digital mining network in a deserted wing of City Hall. The aim, he said, is to make Jackson a Southeastern tech center.
Like many Americans, Mr. Conger discovered crypto during the pandemic and soon fell down an internet rabbit hole. His plans have turned him into something of a celebrity in the crypto world, a strange distinction for the leader of a midsize industrial hub where Pringles potato chips are manufactured.
“Bitcoin is a great financial equalizer,” Mr. Conger declared this month in an interview at City Hall. “It’s a hedge against inflation. It can bridge that wealth gap.”

The ballooning popularity of Bitcoin and other digital currencies has given rise to a strange new political breed: the crypto mayor. Eric Adams, New York’s new mayor, accepted his first paycheck in Bitcoin and another cryptocurrency, Ether. Francis Suarez, Miami’s mayor, headlines crypto conferences. Now even mayors of smaller towns are trying to incorporate crypto into municipal government, courting start-ups and experimenting with buzzy new technologies like nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, to raise money for public projects.
Their growing ranks reflect the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies, which are highly volatile and have fallen in value in recent days. The mayors’ embrace of crypto is also a recognition that its underlying blockchain technology — essentially a distributed ledger system — may create new revenue streams for cities and reshape some basic functions of local government.
“Mayors rationally want to attract high-income citizens who pay their taxes and impose few costs on the municipality,” said Joseph Grundfest, a business professor at Stanford. “Crypto geeks fit this bill perfectly.”
But as with many ambitious crypto projects, it’s unclear whether these local initiatives will ultimately amount to much. So far, most are either largely symbolic or largely theoretical. And the mayors’ aims are partly political: Crypto boosterism has a useful bipartisan appeal, garnering popularity among both antigovernment conservatives and socially liberal tech moguls.

“You can do these things because you want to be associated with dudes with AR-15s, or you want to be associated with Meta,” said Finn Brunton, a technology studies professor at the University of California, Davis, who wrote a 2019 book about the history of crypto. “A lot of it is hype and hot air.”

In Jackson, Mr. Conger has become a frequent guest on crypto podcasts, where he is hailed as a leader in “the army of Satoshi,” a reference to Bitcoin’s shadowy founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. A broad-shouldered former college football player, Mr. Conger sometimes goes to work wearing socks emblazoned with tiny orange Bitcoins.
But his crypto ambitions have already encountered obstacles. While he’s close to establishing a system for city employees to invest a portion of their paychecks in Bitcoin, his mining proposal has proved impossible to institute under existing laws.
Mr. Conger wants to use public money to plug a bank of computers into the Bitcoin network, an energy-guzzling process that could generate new coins for the city. He has even found a place to put the hardware: a suite of rooms in City Hall that have remained unfinished since the building opened in 1998. But a state law limits the types of assets that cities can invest in, partly to protect residents from market volatility. Mr. Conger and other local officials are working on new legislation to add Bitcoin to the list of permissible investments.
In many ways, Mr. Conger is following in the footsteps of Miami’s Mr. Suarez, who has emerged as the crypto-bro-in-chief of mayors. (The two men occasionally text; Mr. Conger’s communications director calls it a “Bitcoin bromance.”) Mr. Suarez has positioned Miami as a “crypto capital” and thrown his support behind MiamiCoin, a crypto token that anyone can buy or mine, with a portion of the proceeds flowing into city coffers. He recently jousted on Twitter with Mr. Adams of New York over which of them loves crypto more.

“Every time I would talk about crypto, my analytics would go through the roof,” Mr. Suarez, 44, said in an interview. “The analytics went crazy.”
Mr. Suarez now styles himself as a kind of crypto diplomat. After taking over this month as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan coalition of city mayors, he urged members to sign a “crypto compact” calling on the federal government to eschew overly aggressive regulation of the industry.
Last month, Mr. Suarez had a private Zoom call with Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who has called for increased scrutiny of crypto.
“It was kind of funny,” Mr. Suarez said. “He said, ‘I think I should have done a little bit more homework.’ It was his own way of saying that I really knew what I was talking about.” (The S.E.C. declined to comment.)

Mr. Suarez’s vice chair at the Conference of Mayors is a fellow crypto enthusiast, Hillary Schieve, who’s in her second term as the mayor of Reno, Nev. Last year, she announced plans to turn a popular whale sculpture in downtown Reno into an NFT, a unique digital item that can be traded by crypto investors. The goal, Ms. Schieve said, was to funnel the profits into Reno’s arts scene.
“It would be great to cut out the middleman,” Ms. Schieve said of her embrace of crypto. “I’m not a big fan of banks.”
A decentralized city government built on blockchain technology has been a longstanding goal of crypto fans. Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, the blockchain behind Ether, wrote a blog post on the topic in October. And last year, a group of crypto investors bought 40 acres of land in Wyoming, aiming to build a blockchain city run by a decentralized network of investors, each of whom would vote on important decisions.
For now, most crypto-enthused officials are focused on comparatively modest projects. Mark Wheeler, chief information officer for Philadelphia, became fascinated with crypto in 2018 after hearing about an effort in Cook County, Ill., to list property records on a decentralized database.

“Improving the quality of property-data management inside city government is like the white whale that I’ve been trying to catch,” he said.
Mr. Wheeler stopped listening to NPR in the morning, tuning into crypto podcasts instead. In November, he invited crypto experts to propose initiatives for Philadelphia; the original Bitcoin white paper is now posted on the city’s website.
The fervor has spread to small-town America. Last year, Jalen Nelson, a 26-year-old crypto enthusiast, cold-emailed 2,000 U.S. mayors, hoping to engage them in discussions about blockchain technology. He got one response — from Chris Swanson, the mayor of Two Harbors, Minn., a town of about 4,000 on the shore of Lake Superior.
Mr. Swanson was taken with the idea of forming a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO — a collective of crypto investors — that would pool money to fund projects in Two Harbors in exchange for some kind of voting power over the new initiatives.
“Trying to get something built can be really complicated, and you end up going to the same pools of money over and over and over again,” said Mr. Swanson, 44. “The projects that the community wants to see could get done quicker.”

Mr. Nelson, who recently moved to San Antonio from California, has never set foot in Two Harbors, where winter temperatures can drop well below zero. (On a recent Zoom call, he chose a tropical background, with palm trees swaying in the breeze. “I told Chris I would visit him in the warmer months,” he said.) For now, the project remains entirely theoretical.
But with the mayor’s backing, Mr. Nelson is planning to establish a trust fund that would serve as the basis of the DAO. “I’m dreaming,” he said. “Two Harbors could turn into Disneyland.”

Back in Jackson, Mr. Conger said he just wanted to make the city a place where his children would be comfortable settling down after college. He comes from a respected local political family: His grandfather served as Jackson’s mayor, and a great-great-great-grandfather ran the city in 1861 and 1871, when mayors served one-year terms.
Still, Mr. Conger acknowledged that some Jackson residents were skeptical of his crypto ambitions.
“I don’t know that I’d want my retirement in that,” said Bobby Maness, 54, an electrician, as he sat down for lunch at a local burger joint this month. “What I worry is, when I get there, will it be worth anything?”

Mr. Conger has no such concerns.
On a table in his office, he keeps what looks like a copy of the Jane Austen novel “Pride and Prejudice.” Although he remembers studying the book in high school, Mr. Conger is not an Austen fan, and the book is not actually a book. It’s a decorative box he found on Amazon, concealing a safe where he stores his personal Bitcoin wallet."

Market messages
Stock markets took investors on another wild ride yesterday, plunging, recovering and then dropping again. Futures are looking up today, but what does that mean after a week of such swings in stocks?
The Fed’s latest policy announcement should provide some clarity, with uncertainty over what the central bank will say a key source of the recent volatility, according to market watchers. Economists do not expect Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, to raise interest rates at the end of the Fed’s two-day meeting this afternoon. But details about rate increases, which many expect to begin in March, will be closely watched, as will other hints about the bank’s efforts to unwind other pandemic stimulus programs.
The big question: How aggressively will the Fed act to fight inflation? Moving more forcefully risks denting economic growth, something stock investors appeared to be fretting about this week. Powell’s comments “will provide some much-needed clarity on where the Fed officials’ heads are,” said Anu Gaggar, a strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network.

The jitters in stocks haven’t been reflected in other major markets, and some strategists think that those markets might give a better signal of what’s next for the economy, given the remarkable run-up in stock prices during the pandemic. Here’s what’s been happening away from the ups and downs of stocks:
Government bonds, which in many ways are more closely tied to the Fed and the economy than stocks, appear to be taking developments in stride. Yields fell over the past week, which is normally a sign of nerves, but not by much. “The bond market is not willing to move decisively in one direction or another because the economy is still in pretty good shape,” Vincent Deluard, a strategist at StoneX Group, told DealBook.
Corporate bonds have also remained in check, which suggests that investors aren’t overly nervous about the prospects for economic growth (a key factor in company creditworthiness). In 2008, for instance, corporate bond spreads — the difference between company debt yields and their government equivalents — rose 4 percentage points. In early 2020, spreads rose by nearly 3 percentage points. Over the past two months, corporate spreads are up less than a fifth of a percentage point. The recent re-pricing in bonds has been “pretty orderly,” said Eddy Vataru, a bond fund manager at Osterweis.
Oil prices are up 30 percent over the past two months. That’s partially because of fears of war in Ukraine, which could disrupt Russia’s supply of oil to world markets (more on that below). But if oil investors believed the global economy, in general, was headed for a significant slowdown, prices would be expected to fall.

Microsoft beats profit expectations. The software maker reported record fourth-quarter earnings, though its shares briefly tumbled in postmarket trading before recovering, because the details disappointed some shareholders. Nevertheless, investors hope the report will presage rosy results from other tech giants.
The I.M.F. cuts growth estimates for China and the U.S. The institution warned that the world’s two biggest economies would suffer from higher inflation, pandemic shutdowns and supply chain problems. One such problem: The Commerce Department said that the U.S. faced an “alarming” shortage of computer chips.
The Biden administration withdraws its coronavirus vaccine mandate for large companies. The Labor Department’s move came after the Supreme Court found the rule unconstitutional. In other pandemic news, a New York appeals court judge reinstated the state’s indoor mask mandate, and California will again require employers to provide extra paid sick leave to workers recovering from Covid.
Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting returns to Omaha. After two years of virtual events, Warren Buffett’s conglomerate plans to hold this year’s shareholder gathering, known as “Woodstock for Capitalists,” in person on April 30.

Follow the bouncing Bitcoin
The I.M.F. urged El Salvador yesterday to end its recognition of Bitcoin as legal tender. Adopting a cryptocurrency in this way “entails large risks for financial and market integrity, financial stability and consumer protection,” the fund’s executive board wrote.
The price of Bitcoin has fallen by more than 50 percent from its peak in November, and the crypto market as a whole has lost more than $1 trillion in value over that time. For some prominent institutions that have bought into crypto, from El Salvador’s government to some multinational corporations, the downturn could prove costly — and may create regulatory headaches.

Will Bitcoin bounce again? A year ago, when the meme-stock frenzy was about to morph into a crypto boom, Bitcoin was worth just over $30,000. Since then, it has twice more than doubled in price and then given up the gains. Crypto evangelists like President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, Elon Musk of Tesla and Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy seem undeterred.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
El Salvador has spent about $85.5 million on Bitcoin since adopting the cryptocurrency as legal tender in September, including a $15 million purchase a few days ago, during the latest dip. The country has paid an average of about $47,500 per Bitcoin, and the current price is about $37,000, meaning that the Salvadoran investment has lost about 23 percent of its value. “Most people go in when the price is up, but the safest and most profitable moment to buy is when the price is down,” Bukele said on Twitter, where he announces Bitcoin purchases and rebukes critics of this investment strategy. “It’s not rocket science.”
MicroStrategy is also unmoved by the downturn. The business intelligence software company has spent about $3.75 billion on Bitcoin, an investment now worth about $4.5 billion. The company’s finance chief told The Wall Street Journal yesterday that it would keep on buying.
But holding crypto is an accounting hassle. In December, the S.E.C. told MicroStrategy to revise how it reports the value of its hefty Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy argued that the crypto should be treated like other assets, with gains and losses recognized immediately. The S.E.C. treats Bitcoin like intangibles, with losses reflected by impairments but gains recognized only upon a sale. (Tesla, which bought $1.5 billion in Bitcoin last year, reports quarterly results today and may face questions on the value of its holdings.) From an accounting perspective, then, holding on to crypto can only ever be a neutral or losing proposition.
In other crypto news, the market drop hit the price of an NFT sold by Melania Trump in an auction that ended today.

How businesses are preparing for a war in Ukraine
Tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to escalate. Russia has mobilized about 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine, and U.S. intelligence suggests that Ukraine’s military would not be able to stop a potential invasion.
A military flare-up would threaten to destabilize the already volatile region, with serious consequences for the security structure that has governed Europe since the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago. That would have major implications for businesses around the world.

Sanctions: In the event of an invasion, the U.S. and its allies have threatened to impose sanctions against Russia far beyond those implemented in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea. They would be directed at cutting off the largest Russian financial institutions that depend on global financial transfers, limiting technology exports in the aerospace and arms industries, and potentially banning the export of any consumer goods to Russia. A trade group representing Chevron, G.E. and other big American companies that do business in Russia recently asked the White House to consider giving U.S. companies “safe harbors or wind-down periods” as it considers imposing sanctions.
Energy supplies: Russia provides about a third of the gas and crude oil imported by the E.U. The Biden administration said yesterday it was working with energy suppliers from the Middle East, North Africa and Asia to bolster supplies to Europe in the coming weeks. The theory is that, once they are reassured about energy supplies, European allies will be more willing to go along with sanctions, if it comes to that.
Operations in Ukraine: A number of American and European companies have moved their software development to Ukraine, which exports more than $5 billion worth of I.T. services every year. If Russia invades, these companies may face major disruptions. Many global tech deals have a Ukrainian element, such as Hitachi of Japan buying GlobalLogic of the U.S. for $9.6 billion last year: GlobalLogic employs more than 5,700 people at offices across Ukraine.

2022-01-27,"In most modern cars and S.U.V.s, dashboard navigation systems help motorists plot a road trip, give them a route to client meetings or lead them to their children’s away soccer games. But where is a Lamborghini Huracán driver headed?
Wherever that may be, a new navigation system starting in 2022 models will help get the car there — and hopefully with greater certainty. A console-mounted app called What3words is coming to these Lamborghinis, and it will be the first of its kind to incorporate Amazon’s voice-activated Alexa feature.
Previously available in other cars, but without Alexa, the What3words system divides the world into 57 trillion 10-foot (3-by-3-meter) squares and assigns each a unique three-word address code randomly chosen from a customized standard dictionary.
“The Huracán app is significant,” said Chris Sheldrick, chief executive of What3words, which is based in London. “So many drivers struggle with inputting the address and wind up at the wrong location.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Aimed at enhancing both the speed and accuracy of car navigation systems, What3words is said to overcome common issues such as duplicate street names. To cite a few: There are 367 Park Streets in California; Australia has 521 George Streets; and in Greater London, there are 14 Church Roads.
“Traditional addresses often aren’t suitable for voice input,” Mr. Sheldrick added, “and a lot of the time, the best spots don’t have any addresses at all.”
For example, a Huracán driver wishing to view San Francisco Bay from the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge would first call up an image of the bridge on the What3words screen, then identify the coded, 10-foot square corresponding to that location. After voicing the code aloud — in this case “scar-milk-focus” — the driver would follow Alexa’s guidance to that exact spot.
The Rise of Electric Vehicles
Affordable Models: More efficient manufacturing, falling battery costs and intense competition are lowering sticker prices for battery-powered vehicles to within striking distance of gasoline cars.
Keeping China Out: President Biden wants to shield American producers of electric vehicles from cheaper Chinese options. Here are the policy and political considerations of Biden’s efforts.
Retiring the Malibu: General Motors said that it would stop making the Chevrolet Malibu, the last affordable sedan in its U.S. model lineup, to produce more electric cars.
Tesla’s Pullback: The automaker led by Elon Musk is no longer planning to take the lead in expanding the number of places to fuel electric vehicles. It’s not clear how quickly other companies will fill the gap.
The navigation system is part of Lamborghini’s push to meet customer expectations beyond horsepower. This year reportedly will be the company’s last to offer internal combustion engines only — in 2023 it is expected to debut hybrid models, with all-electrics coming later in the decade. (All of this technology and prowess may be paying off for Lamborghini, which in 2021 posted its best year ever, delivering 8,405 cars.)
“We start with the car and its driver,” said Luca Giardino, head of connectivity for Lamborghini. “The Huracán links computer software and hardware in ways that enhance that relationship. What3words allows greater focus on the pure driving experience — without the distraction of being uncertain whether or not you will arrive at the correct destination.”

Mr. Sheldrick, a former music promoter and organizer, developed What3words in response to frequent address difficulties faced by his touring musicians. For example, he recalled an incident in Italy when a driver unloaded a truckload of instruments an hour north, rather than an hour south, of Rome. On another occasion, a frantic keyboard player called him from somewhere in London and said, “Don’t panic, Chris, but we may have just sound-checked the wrong wedding.”
Mr. Sheldrick contacted a school friend who is a mathematician in hopes of developing a system that would be as precise as GPS latitude and longitude coordinates but easier and faster to use. Shortly after their talk, the friend created the application’s first three-word address algorithm on the back of an envelope.

“Lamborghini is a trailblazer in being the first to implement this system,” said John Scumniotales, Alexa Automotive’s head of product. “They certainly won’t be the last. We’re excited to see how this partnership progresses.”
Huracán drivers do not pay to use the system — What3words charges a flat fee to Lamborghini and other companies that buy the app.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“People around the world are using What3words addresses to find, share and describe places faster and more easily,” Mr. Sheldrick said, “from festivalgoers to delivery drivers, event organizers and postal services.”
Voiceless versions of the What3words technology have been adopted in selected models by other carmakers, including Mercedes-Benz, Lotus, Tata Motors and Ford. The app is free to download on Apple iPhones and iPads and on Android platforms, which can then integrate with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
“This could be really convenient when I’m trying to figure out which parking lot to use when I go to my son’s football games,” said Chris Gerdes, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford and co-director of the university’s Center for Automotive Research.
While advanced navigation tools like What3words hold promise, Mr. Gerdes said he remained skeptical that they would propel automakers on a speedy path to fully autonomous cars. Creating and orchestrating the intricate mosaic of automated cameras and sensors, machine learning tools and algorithms needed to achieve reliable self-driving cars are far greater technical challenges, he said.
“A successful autonomous system requires that the self-driving vehicle be constantly aware of other objects and conveyances” — and how they’re moving, Mr. Gerdes said.

While widespread self-driving ability may still be in the future, complex computer applications and electronics are finding increasing use in high-end “driver’s cars.”
The $200,000 V-10 Huracán, for example, with 602 horsepower and a 0-to-60 acceleration time of 2.5 seconds, fairly bristles with computer-assisted performance. Its “predictive system” adjusts for driver inputs in a way that can even correct for gear-shifting errors.

And Mr. Gerdes said Lamborghini representatives had recently visited Stanford to view a demonstration of the center’s autonomous racecars.

The growing embrace of technology is notable. The former Ferrari chief Sergio Marchionne once famously described the idea of an electric vehicle’s wearing the prancing horse badge as an “almost obscene concept.” But in 2013 came the 963-horsepower La Ferrari, the company’s first car to use a hybrid drive system featuring a V-12 internal combustion engine and two electric motors.
Last year, Ferrari added a third electric motor to its SF90 Stradale for a boost to 983 horsepower. The Purosangue, the automaker’s much-anticipated, first-ever S.U.V., is widely expected to offer a plug-in hybrid when introduced this year.
“If you look at where modern cars are going, I definitely think autonomous operation will become part of the future enthusiast car experience,” Mr. Gerdes said. “It will be very possible to build cars that enthusiasts love to drive when they want to and then can switch to autonomous operation when they don’t.”
The Patrick Ottis Company in Berkeley, Calif., is widely ranked among the world’s premier restorers of vintage Ferrari automobiles and motors. Mr. Ottis said that in May he will “mark a half-century of repairing Ferrari internal combustion engines.”
His shop is keeping pace with Ferrari’s updates. “We’ve just taken on a talented Ferrari mechanic with 40 years’ experience,” Mr. Ottis said. “He’s totally conversant with all the new models, including La Ferrari.

2022-01-28,"When an Israeli company released a new spyware product known as Pegasus in 2011, it changed cyberwarfare. Pegasus could reliably decipher the communications of smartphones without the phone’s user knowing and without the cooperation of AT&T, Apple or any other company.
Mexico’s government bought Pegasus — from NSO Group, the Israeli start-up that created it — and used it to capture El Chapo, the drug lord. European investigators used the product to break up a child sex-abuse ring and stop terrorist plots.
But Pegasus also created some problems, and they quickly started becoming clear, too. Governments could use it to monitor and suppress critics and political opponents. Mexico was an example: It deployed the spyware not only against El Chapo but also against dissidents and journalists. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates used it against civil rights activists.
The F.B.I. bought a version of Pegasus in 2019, according to a new Times Magazine investigation by Ronen Bergman and Mark Mazzetti. Since then, U.S. officials across the Trump and Biden administrations have debated whether to use it within this country as well as abroad.

Even so, the American government’s copy of Pegasus continues to sit in a New Jersey office building, ready to be turned on if the federal government changes its policy.
Ronen’s and Mark’s story is full of other revelations, too:
Israel has used Pegasus as a diplomatic sweetener. It gave the U.A.E. and Bahrain access to it, which helped lead to the Abraham Accords, the 2020 pact in which the Arab countries normalized relations with Israel. At one point, Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, threatened to block a crucial part of the deal unless Israel renewed Saudi Arabia’s license to use Pegasus.
The C.I.A. bought a copy of Pegasus for Djibouti, to assist it in combating terrorism — despite the country’s record of human rights abuses, including the torture of dissidents.
Pegasus has helped knit together right-wing nationalist governments around the world, with Hungary, India and Poland collaborating on its use. Benjamin Netanyahu, then Israel’s prime minister, decided not to order Poland’s Pegasus system to be cut off even after the country passed laws that many in Israel saw as Holocaust denial, and the Polish prime minister spoke of “Jewish perpetrators” among those responsible for the genocide.
In addition to these fascinating details, the story underscores a larger point about cyberwarfare. As Ronen and Mark write:
Cyberweapons have changed international relations more profoundly than any advance since the advent of the atomic bomb. In some ways, they are even more profoundly destabilizing — they are cheap, easily distributed and can be deployed without consequences to the attacker. Dealing with their proliferation is radically changing the nature of state relations, as Israel long ago discovered and the rest of the world is now also beginning to understand.
More than 75 years after the invention of nuclear weapons, only nine countries appear to have a usable one. But dozens of countries already have cyberweapons. “Everybody seems to want them,” Mark told me, “and this gives enormous power to the countries who sell them and can use them for diplomatic advantage.”
It has also led to a huge increase in government spying, for good and for ill.

A baseball debate goes on
Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens both failed to make the Baseball Hall of Fame this week, in their 10th and final year on the ballot. But the debate over their candidacies — both their undeniable statistical greatness and their presumed steroid use — is hardly over.
There are two paths to the Hall of Fame. In the first, sportswriters vote on candidates, and a player must receive at least 75 percent of the vote. Bonds received 66 percent this year, and Clemens 65 percent. The voters who kept them out of the Hall of Fame have, in effect, labeled them cheaters. In the second, a group called an era committee — composed mostly of Hall of Fame players and baseball executives — will evaluate players from 1988 onward. That group votes later this year.
Many writers, fans and players say Bonds and Clemens deserve to be inducted. For one thing, some current Hall members have their own history of cheating: Pitcher Gaylord Perry was inducted in 1991 despite doctoring baseballs, and for decades much of the league used amphetamine pills known as “greenies.” For another, Bonds and Clemens weren’t simply great players; they were among the best ever, dominating the sport at a time when many others used performance-enhancing drugs.
Some players accused of doping have already gotten in, including David Ortiz, who was elected this week. Others, such as Alex Rodriguez and Manny Ramirez, have not, though they remain on next year’s ballot. — Matthew Cullen, a Morning writer

What’s Up? (Jan. 23-29)
The End of Near-Zero Interest Rates
After nearly two years of near-zero interest rates, the Federal Reserve signaled that it would probably raise them in March. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said officials no longer thought that America’s rapidly healing economy needed so much support, given that inflation is running far above policymakers’ target and the tight labor market. By making it more expensive to borrow money to buy a house or car, the Fed hopes the higher interest rates will cool demand and eventually help rein in inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, was 5.8 percent in December, the fastest pace since 1982 and one that could be disastrous for the political prospects of President Biden and his fellow Democrats in the November midterm elections.
Market Turbulence
Whether you held traditional stocks, cryptocurrencies or a combination of both, it was a stressful week to be an investor. Stocks swung wildly as uncertainty about upcoming interest rate increases — how many and how quickly — came at the same time as positive signs about growth in the American economy last year. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, continued its dramatic fall before inching up slightly, though its value remained just above where it was last summer. Bitcoin’s value is now about half of its peak in November.
Slowing Economies
The International Monetary Fund released new predictions for 2022, showing slower economic growth than it had previously predicted, driven mostly by issues with the world’s two largest economies, China and the United States. Compared with the 5.9 percent growth experienced in 2021, the I.M.F. predicted that global growth this year would be 4.4 percent, down from its earlier prediction of 4.9 percent. The demise of President Biden’s Build Back Better legislation coupled with reduced economic support from the Fed and persistent supply chain issues contributed to the lower expectations for the United States, while China’s economy continues to struggle with its disruptive “zero Covid” approach and a troubled real estate sector.

To Boycott or Not to Boycott?
The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics begin this week, as China is under increasing scrutiny for human rights abuses, including allegations of forced labor in Uyghur communities in Xinjiang. The United States, Britain, Canada and Australia have announced they will not be sending government officials to Beijing, in a diplomatic boycott of the Games. Many of the world’s most famous brands, however, will still be there, including Visa and Coca-Cola. Corporations’ reluctance to boycott the Games could soften the political blow of the diplomatic boycotts.

The State of the Job Market
The Labor Department will release its report on January’s employment figures on Friday, indicating the state of the job market at the year’s outset and the extent to which the Omicron variant has affected it. Last month’s report showed that 199,000 jobs were added to the economy in December, the smallest gain of 2021. But with the unemployment rate at 3.9 percent, people who are looking for jobs are having little trouble finding them. Employers, however, continue to struggle to attract workers, with demand for them far outweighing supply. The Labor Department will also release data on the number of Americans who voluntarily left their jobs in December. A record 4.5 million Americans quit their jobs in November.
Another Vote on an Amazon Union
Workers at an Amazon warehouse in Birmingham, Ala., will begin voting in a mail-in election to decide whether to form a union. Last spring, workers there voted against unionization before the National Labor Relations Board threw out the vote, citing improper interference from Amazon. If the vote for unionization succeeds this time, it would be the first union at the online retailer, which employs about a million people in the United States. Amazon workers at a warehouse in Staten Island are also pushing for a union vote. And Starbucks workers recently voted to unionize at two locations.

China’s pandemic controls may outlive the virus
During the coronavirus pandemic, China has honed its powers to track and corral its 1.4 billion citizens, backed by upgraded technology, armies of neighborhood workers and broad public support.
The foundation of the controls is the country’s health code. Based on location, travel history, test results and other health data, people are assigned a color — green, yellow or red — that determines whether they are allowed into buildings or public spaces. Legions of local officials now have the power to quarantine residents or restrict their movements.
Now, officials are turning their sharpened surveillance against other risks, including crime, pollution and “hostile” political forces. This amounts to a potent techno-authoritarian tool for Xi Jinping, China’s leader, as he intensifies his campaigns against corruption and dissent.

Concerns: Zan Aizong, a former journalist in Hangzhou, said that more surveillance could help the authorities break up dissenters’ activities. He has refused to use the health code, but it means that moving around is difficult, and he finds it hard to explain his reasoning to workers at checkpoints.

U.S. plays hardball with Russia
In an effort to deter an invasion of Ukraine, President Biden has threatened punishing sanctions on Russia that could cause a stock market crash, severe inflation or other forms of financial panic that would inflict pain on Russia’s people and could roil other major economies, particularly those in Europe.
The pain caused by the sanctions could also foment anger against Vladimir Putin, Russia’s leader. But resilience is part of Russia’s national identity, and three reactionary security officials dedicated to restoring Soviet glory have Putin’s ear.
Yesterday, in a sign of hope for further diplomacy, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said the country had sent an “urgent demand” to NATO to clarify its stance, days after the U.S. and its allies formally rejected Moscow’s demands.
Some analysts warn that Russia might retaliate over the sanctions by cutting off natural gas shipments to Europe or by carrying out cyberattacks against American and European infrastructure. Ukrainian officials criticized the Biden administration for its warnings of an imminent Russian attack, saying they had needlessly spread alarm.

U.S. allies retake control of prison in Syria
Kurdish-led forces regained full control of a prison in northeastern Syria yesterday in the most intense urban combat involving American soldiers in Iraq or Syria since the self-declared ISIS caliphate fell in 2019.
On Saturday, Kurdish-led counterterrorism forces backed by U.S. Special Operations troops went house to house in the narrow alleys of the Ghweran neighborhood of Hasaka, a majority-Arab city, throwing flash grenades into homes where they believed ISIS fighters were hiding. Clearing operations to find ISIS sleeper cells continued yesterday.
Journalists for The Times saw several dozen bodies, some dressed in orange prison jumpsuits, being removed over the weekend by Kurdish militiamen near the prison, an indication of the scale of fighting.

Background: The latest round of fighting began this month after an attack by ISIS on the prison, which housed more than 3,000 ISIS members and almost 700 minors. The Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish militia, said that the remaining militants in the prison were believed to be holding teenage detainees — “cubs of the caliphate” — as human shields.

A second year of Sundance at home
The Sundance Film Festival — virtual for the second year in a row — wrapped this past weekend. “At a time when many of us are worried about the health of movies,” the film critic A.O. Scott writes, “it offers proof of life.”
Among the notable films: Jesse Eisenberg’s directorial debut, “When You Finish Saving the World,” about an Indiana teenager struggling with romance; “Navalny,” a suspenseful documentary about the Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny; “Nanny,” which subjects its protagonist, a Senegalese immigrant living in New York, to supernatural and psychological scares; and Mariama Diallo’s “Master,” a campus drama about a Black student and a Black professor in hostile surroundings.
One of Scott’s favorite films was Sara Dosa’s “Fire of Love,” which tells the story of a French couple who studied volcanoes. The film’s scenes of violent eruptions and serene lava flows were captured by the couple’s cameras before their deaths in 1991.

2022-02-01,"These days, there is so much uncertainty surrounding Google’s parent company, Alphabet: a global pandemic, fears of inflation gripping the U.S. economy, restive employees challenging management, and regulators and politicians seemingly bent on taking their pound of flesh.
But one thing has not changed. Alphabet continues to make money. Lots of it.
On Tuesday, Alphabet reported a 36 percent increase in profit, to $20.64 billion, in the last three months of 2021 on revenue of $75.32 billion, up 32 percent from a year earlier. The earnings were above analysts’ estimates of $19 billion in profit and $72.3 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by FactSet.
Alphabet shares jumped 8 percent in aftermarket trading from a closing price of $2,752.88. The company also announced plans for a 20-for-1 stock split — a move that is usually cheered by the market because it makes each share more affordable.
Five days after Apple posted a record quarterly result, Google’s blockbuster earnings were more proof that the tech giants continue to make massive profits in the face of supply chain constraints, concerns about inflation and a prolonged pandemic.

Google’s strong results were a reminder of the underlying power of its business and how, regardless of the circumstances surrounding it, the company will continue to thrive as long as people are active on the internet.
Google search remains the preferred on-ramp to the internet. YouTube is an essential online destination for entertainment, information and music. While it lags Amazon and Microsoft, Google is well positioned to capitalize on the seismic shift of businesses outsourcing technology infrastructure to the cloud.
With a firm foundation, Google has made slight tweaks to fortify its strongholds.
The company has made changes to how it allows retailers to list products in an effort to entice more users to start on Google or YouTube when shopping online. In a recent survey, Morgan Stanley found that the percentage of people starting shopping searches on Google and YouTube had increased since May, while the percentage of Amazon Prime users starting searches on Amazon had decreased.
While Facebook and other internet companies felt the sting of tighter privacy controls implemented by Apple on its devices, Google’s advertising business, which includes ads on YouTube, continued to expand, growing 32 percent in the quarter, to $61.2 billion.
YouTube has introduced short — less than 60 seconds — videos to rival TikTok and appeal to a younger audience. Google said it has more than tripled the number of salespeople at its Cloud unit since 2019 as part of a push to expand into new industries and forge partnerships. Google Cloud revenue rose 45 percent, to $5.5 billion, while the unit’s losses narrowed to $890 million, down from a loss of $1.24 billion a year earlier.

Google said it hired 6,500 employees during the quarter, raising its total head count to 156,500 people. Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, said she expected the “strong pace of hiring” to continue in 2022.
She also noted that she expected a “meaningful increase” in capital spending this year, including the cost of building or retrofitting office buildings.
On a conference call, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s chief executive, took a question about potential antitrust legislation being discussed in Congress. Mr. Pichai said he was concerned the proposals could “break” a wide range of Google services and hurt the company’s ability to protect users.
He also echoed an argument made by Meta, the parent company of Facebook, that the proposals targeting Big Tech “can hurt American competitiveness” because they could disadvantage U.S. companies."
2022-02-02,"As Google extended its dominance as a search engine over the past two decades, the Czech Republic stood out as a surprising holdout.
People in the European nation preferred Seznam, a search engine started in Prague in 1996, two years before Google. For about 15 years, the company’s focus on its local market provided a feel-good story about a hometown underdog prevailing against a rising global titan.
But when smartphones became commonplace, most of them with Google installed as the default search, Seznam’s luck ran out. Google today controls more than 80 percent of the Czech search market, and Seznam is a marginal search engine with more of a focus on media.
Since its fall, Seznam has been a continual thorn in Google’s side, including when it joined a complaint against the search giant that led to a record fine. Now it is also helping to inspire laws to crimp the power of companies like Google, with consequences that go far beyond the Czech Republic.

European lawmakers are putting the final touches on a law aimed at protecting businesses like Seznam by preventing large tech companies from unfairly bundling services to box out rivals. It would require Google and other tech giants to make services from smaller firms more easily available to users.
The new rules, expected to pass by June, would affect how Apple and Google operate app stores, Amazon sells products online, and Meta and Google sell online advertising.
The debate in Europe is being closely watched in countries including the United States, where the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have also proposed updating competition rules targeting the world’s largest tech companies.

This wave of new regulation is a sign of the worldwide concern that some companies have reached such a scale that new competitors cannot emerge, giving the platforms outsize influence over business and society. The internet, once seen as creating a decentralized way for a constellation of businesses to reach users around the world, is controlled by a shrinking number of corporate behemoths. There is less room, policymakers fear, for smaller companies to thrive.

“We are an example of the consequences,” said Michal Feix, a former chief executive of Seznam, who now leads its policy and legal work as an outside consultant. Without the new laws, he said, “you just can’t compete.”
Google said its success in the Czech Republic was the result of building a superior service. Czechs “choose our products because they help people find the information they’re looking for — and because we make thousands of improvements every year,” Google said in a statement.
In the Czech Republic, Seznam’s history traces to early enthusiasm about the internet.
Ivo Lukacovic, the founder and owner of Seznam, recalled a childhood without much money; his family had no car or color TV. As a teenager in 1989, when the country was still part of Czechoslovakia, he joined classmates in mass demonstrations, known as the Velvet Revolution, that contributed to the fall of the ruling Communist Party.
“The regime collapsed, and the era of economic freedom began,” Mr. Lukacovic said on a recent blustery morning outside Prague. “Since I played with computers, I went to university,” he added.
At 22, Mr. Lukacovic dropped out of Czech Technical University in Prague after creating Seznam, which means “list” in Czech. It started as a recommendation site of 10 or so Czech websites to visit. A search engine was added in 1998; email, maps and other services arrived in the years after.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The company continued to grow after Google opened in the country in 2006. Seznam’s search engine was tailored to Czech speakers, and it added services like unlimited email storage to keep up with Google’s offerings. In 2008, the Czech Republic, whose population of 10.5 million is about the size of North Carolina, was the only place in the 31-country European Economic Area where Google was not the leading search engine.
By 2010, Seznam’s position began to change. Google had invested considerably in improving its non-English language services and tried to endear itself to Czech citizens through efforts like digitizing the ancient books held at the 18th-century Baroque library in Prague’s Old Town.
But Seznam felt something more underhanded was at work.
Google owned Android, the operating system used on most of the world’s smartphones. And it had a deal with Apple that made its search engine the default choice on the iPhone. As internet browsing habits moved from personal computers to smartphones, Seznam was at a disadvantage.
Google offered Android free to phone manufacturers like Samsung and LG, but it required the companies to preinstall apps like Google Search and the Chrome browser if they wanted access to the Google Play app store.

Seznam approached handset manufacturers about getting its search service included on phones, but they told Seznam that Google already had deals in place, Mr. Feix said. The biggest drops in Seznam use came every Christmas, he said, when people unwrapped new smartphones with Google apps installed.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In 2012, Seznam went to Czech regulators. And a year later, it joined other companies in filing a complaint with European Commission investigators accusing Google of breaking antitrust laws by using Android to block competition.
The effort was successful, leading to a record fine of 4.34 billion euros, or about $5.1 billion at the time, against Google. The commission said Google had used Android to “cement the dominance of its search engine.” Seznam is named or cited at least 24 times in the decision, which is still under appeal.
But for Seznam, the 2018 decision was too late. The company surrendered its lead in the Czech search market around the summer of 2014, according to Toplist, a market research firm. It now has only about 11 percent of the market. Other research firms said Seznam might have lost its lead as early as 2011, just as smartphone use was exploding.
Last year, Seznam sued Google for roughly $400 million for lost revenue it claims is related to Google’s anticompetitive practices. Google is fighting the suit.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Google, with its preinstalled services, became a de facto standard,” Mr. Feix said. “Seznam was unable to compete on Android devices and missed that critical time frame of mobile adoption.”
In the European Union, policymakers point to Seznam’s experience as evidence of the need for stronger and swifter intervention in the digital economy.
The new antitrust law, the Digital Markets Act, would speed up tech-related competition investigations and require tech companies of a certain size to give users access to rival services. The penalties could be up to 10 percent of a company’s global revenue, worth about $18 billion for Google. On new Android smartphones, users would be able to choose an alternative search engine or browser to use, a remedy that was also included in the 2018 penalty against Google in the Android case.
“Europe will be the first in setting these kinds of rules,” said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition and digital policy. “Maybe others will take the inspiration so there can be a global movement.”
As its search engine business shrank, Seznam turned itself into a media company to survive. At its offices in downtown Prague, where there’s a climbing wall for employees to scale, Seznam operates radio stations and a news website that is one of the most visited in the country. The offices also house a broadcast studio and a space to produce news and culture podcasts. The company is profitable and employs about 1,500 people in the Czech Republic.

And few are likely to feel sorry for Mr. Lukacovic, who is one of the richest people in the Czech Republic. A pilot, he owns a small airport just outside Prague, where he stores collector planes, including a restored 1930s Lockheed Electra that he and his brother restored and flew across the Atlantic Ocean.
But the experience with Google helped teach him an important lesson, he said.
“There’s no fairness in business,” he said. “There’s no justice, no fairness. The stronger will win.”"
2022-02-03,"Jack Reacher is one popular action hero. Hatched by the British writer Lee Child, Reacher has so far righted wrongs in 26 novels and a slew of short stories; the books have collectively sold more 100 million copies worldwide.
Their readers form a surprisingly wide-reaching bunch, and include the novelist Margaret Drabble and the “His Dark Materials” author Philip Pullman. But ask any of them the first thing that comes to mind about Reacher, and the answer is likely to be that he’s big. Real big. Reacher is a 6’5” bruiser who clocks in at around 250 pounds, most of that muscle.
The creators of the new Amazon series “Reacher,” based on the first book, “Killing Floor,” from 1997, were aware they had to get that sheer mass right or risk displeasing fans, who were largely skeptical, to put it mildly, of Tom Cruise’s casting in two earlier Reacher adaptations.
“I know a lot of people had their thoughts on the movies,” said Nick Santora, the series’s showrunner. “When I sat down with the studio, we just started talking about Reacher’s epic and mythical size. It was always a conversation that he would be big — we needed to find an actor that fits the books.”

“Meeting Lee was one of the most nerve-racking experiences of my life,” Ritchson said of Child. “He’s lived with this character for 25 years. Am I going to be enough?”

“But that doesn’t mean that Tom Cruise didn’t do a fantastic job,” Santora quickly added.
Enter Alan Ritchson, a 6-foot-3 actor with biceps the size of Serrano hams, fresh from three seasons of playing the crime-fighting Hawk on the “Titans” series. Child was impressed.
“Before I was a writer, I worked nearly 20 years in television, so I know what goes on,” Child said in a recent video call. As the production advanced, he could see that “it was turning out better than I could dream.”
“How often does that happen?” he added. “Almost never. And that was down to Alan principally — not to make him too bigheaded.”
As for Ritchson, 39, he was downright starry-eyed. And intimidated — not usual for a man his size.
“Meeting Lee was one of the most nerve-racking experiences of my life,” he said in a joint call with Child. “He’s lived with this character for 25 years. Am I going to be enough?”

Finding an actor who would be credible as an imposing, hyper-analytical, seemingly indestructible ex-military police officer — a man who doesn’t technically have super powers but might as well — was an important box to check, but not the only one. A major appeal of the Reacher books is their familiarity: Over the years, they have amassed a canon of beloved recurring details, and it was important for the TV team to get them right.
“We had a list of dos and don’ts,” Santora said. “Don’t ever ask for cream and sugar in Reacher’s coffee; he drinks black coffee. Don’t ever have Reacher treat a woman as a second-class citizen because she might be smaller than he is — the truth is, everyone’s smaller than he is. There’s this very nice simplicity to the man, even though he’s a complex character.”

Ritchson, who had done his homework, came to the role of a similar mind. “I want to be as authentic as possible,” he explained, “and I don’t want to be ridiculed by the many die-hard fans who are going to remember that detail from the book and think that we got it wrong.”
And when there was any uncertainty, Santora had access to the ultimate authority: Child himself, who was an executive producer and involved in the entire process.
Having the creator on tap was handy, especially when it became clear that filling an eight-episode arc would require beefing up the plot of “Killing Floor.” The novel has Reacher — who is essentially homeless and rambles around the country, mostly by bus, with just the clothes on his back and a toothbrush — stumbling into some very bad people in a fictional Georgia town. For the TV series, Santora and his writers imported a key character from other novels.

They also added a small subplot involving a dog.
“We wanted to show a little bit of Reacher that’s not in the book but true to him,” Santora said. “And it also shows Reacher’s morality.”

“I deliberately made Reacher much more of an old-fashioned guy,” said Child, whose Jack Reacher books have collectively sold more 100 million copies.

Child did not mind (and approved the changes). After all, word-for-word adherence to the source material may not, in itself, translate automatically to good television, especially since there is a huge potential audience out there that has not read a single line about Reacher.
“It was a very faithful adaptation, in my opinion, compared to a lot of other stuff that you see,” Child said, “but it’s absolutely inevitable that you need to bring in other things to explain the character.”
“This is not necessarily about the book readers — we already got them,” he added. “We’ve got to keep them happy, which I think we totally have done, and at the same time make a show that anybody can just drop in and love.”
One thing about Reacher that does not need explaining to the book’s fans — or to newcomers, after about half the pilot — is that he is a fighting machine who always ends up in a brawl or three. The outcome is as predictable as Reacher’s coffee order, but still, it had to be clear that he does not relish violence for violence’s sake.

“He wouldn’t go out and seek a fight,” the supervising stunt coordinator, Buster Reeves, said in a video chat. “He’s always the biggest guy in the room and he knows it, so when he got into an altercation, he wouldn’t go overboard to take out an opponent. He would just do what was necessary.”
Even if you are new to the Reacherverse, you might have figured out by now that he is on the side of good. Child usually compares Reacher to the knights-errant who wandered Europe in the Middle Ages, or the samurais of ancient Japan. (The writer has long said that he set his books in the United States to give Reacher more room to roam.)
Creating him was partly a reaction against the troubled anti-heros that had become so fashionable that a kind of one-upmanship was setting in.
“The detective was an alcoholic, which was great the first time out, a real issue, real characterization,” Child said of some contemporary noir stories. “But then the next guy is a divorced alcoholic. Then a divorced alcoholic whose teenage daughter hates him. Then a divorced alcoholic whose teenage daughter hates him, and he’s accidentally shot a kid in the dark so he has to go and live in a cabin in the woods for the rest of his life.
“So I deliberately made Reacher much more of an old-fashioned guy. I wanted to get rid of misery because, ultimately, nobody likes miserable people.”

In hindsight, Child also seemed to anticipate a renewed desire for shedding some of modern life’s unnecessary baggage, which may also help explain why many women are drawn to the books.
“The character is a perfect female fantasy,” Jenny M. Davidson, an English and comparative literature professor at Columbia University and a Reacher superfan, wrote in an email. “The man we want to be with, of course, but also the man we want to be — someone with no domestic ties, none of the burdens of emotional labor, none of the vulnerability that we all really do have in our ordinary day-to-day lives.”
And now the TV series brings him to life as a wish-fulfillment action hunk.
“He just travels; he sees things he wants to see; he eats food he wants to eat,” Santora said. “He talks to people he wants to talk to and ignores the people he has no interest in talking to. He’s kind of living everyone’s dream life!”"
2022-02-04,"For nearly two years, home buyers have been shopping in conditions ripe for regret. Prices have soared, inventory has plunged and competition has been brutal in markets across the country. With fixer-uppers fetching multiple offers, buyers must make snap decisions about what is often the biggest financial investment of their lives.
Invariably, someone makes a choice they wish they hadn’t.
“There are all kinds of craziness happening,” said Marilyn Wilson, a founding partner of the WAV Group, a consumer research company, who described open houses so crowded they felt like nightclubs, with buyers getting 15 minutes to tour a home. “Sometimes people don’t remember, did it have three bedrooms or four? You might get the house, but it might not be the house you want because you’re just in this desperate state.”
The pandemic has turned out to be a historically miserable time to buy a home. Many buyers entered the market looking for a home to solve some of the problems the pandemic created. They wanted more space for Zoom rooms and home gyms. They wanted bigger and better backyards to entertain outdoors.
These expectations ran headlong into the reality of shopping in a frenzied sellers’ market where the pickings were slim and the prices astronomical. Surveys by the WAV Group and Zillow found about three quarters of recent buyers expressed some regret. In the Zillow survey, released on Feb. 4, the findings paint a picture of homeowners second-guessing the choices they made and wishing they’d had more time, more patience or considered living somewhere else. About a third of respondents regret buying a house that needed more work than they anticipated, 31 percent wish the home they bought was bigger and 21 percent thought they overpaid.

“Pandemic era buyers faced unprecedented conditions, they had far fewer homes to choose from, they had far more competition for the homes that were for sale,” said Amanda Pendleton, Zillow’s home trends expert. “A lot of buyers ended up in this home that was maybe not what they expected.”
Buyers stepping into the 2022 market have much to learn from those who shopped before them. Market forecasts predict that conditions won’t change significantly this spring. If anything, they might get tougher. At the end of December, inventory fell to a record low, according to the National Association of Realtors. Zillow projects that home prices will rise another 16 percent in 2022, on top of the 20 percent rise in 2021. Rising interest rates will likely push some buyers out of the market, but they could be replaced with others looking to escape rising rents or shoppers who sat on the sidelines last year, waiting for some stability.
Many successful buyers ended up with homes that they liked, and are happy to own a place. For some of them, that meant making an offer that managed to stand out in a bidding war. For others, it meant recalibrating their expectations during their search to avoid disappointment.
Recent buyers — those who are remorseful and others who are content with their homes — have some sage advice about how they would do it differently if they had to do it all over again.

The Risk of the Impulse Buy
Celeste Mohan and Zach Flynn did not set out to buy a farmhouse with a barn and two cows. But after they lost a bidding war for a rundown house in Boca Raton, Fla., the couple jumped on the 2,660-square-foot house in Lake Wales, a town of 16,000 about an hour from Orlando. They bought it last July for $349,000.
Ms. Mohan, 25, and Mr. Flynn, 29, a teacher, felt pressured to buy because the rent on their one-bedroom in Boca Raton was about to jump 22 percent, to $1,900 a month. With their $400,000 budget, their options were restricted to fixer-uppers, with fierce competition. After their bidding war defeat, the couple headed for the country. The farmhouse, set on five acres on a lake, seemed like an ideal alternative: quiet, pastoral, and charming.

“There really wasn’t much hesitation at that point. We’re defeated, we’re exhausted, we’re anxious,” said Ms. Mohan, a curriculum developer for an educational company. “We really just wanted to own a house.”
Almost immediately, the couple regretted their decision. The property felt eerily quiet and isolated, and maintaining five acres and two cows was more work than they anticipated. “You see these people on Instagram with their farm life,” Ms. Mohan said. “Nobody tells you what actual hard work that is and how time consuming it is.”

Before the summer ended, the couple had given the cows to the neighbor, had moved back to Boca Raton and rented a new apartment. Rather than try to sell the farmhouse, they hope to turn it into an Airbnb. “Right now we’re paying rent and a mortgage, which is really uncomfortable,” Ms. Mohan said. They married in December and are expecting a baby in March, adding to their financial stress.

What they learned: In hindsight, Ms. Mohan wishes she and Mr. Flynn had spent more time evaluating their goals before giving up on Boca Raton. If they had been more clear on what they wanted, they would have known that their wish list included staying in a younger, livelier community. “I also would’ve told myself and Zach to honestly try harder for a house in Boca and to not get so worried about the competition,” she said.
The Cost of Being House Poor

Three months into the pandemic, Stephanie DiSantis felt claustrophobic working from home in her 800-square-foot townhouse in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle.
So, like millions of other Americans, she started looking for a bigger space. She set her maximum budget at $900,000, but soon realized that if she wanted to stay in the central neighborhood, she would have to pay more. She pushed her budget up to $1.3 million, reassessing her priorities.
“I decided, I’ve done a lot of traveling, I’ve had a lot of fun. I’ve done the thing where I’m like, ‘I’m hungry for pasta, I’m going to go to Rome for three days,’” said Ms. DiSantis, 47, who works for Amazon. “I can stop doing that. I can afford to be a little house poor.”
In October 2020, while she was in Massachusetts visiting family for a month, a 2,570-square-foot house dropped the list price to $1.45 million, over her maximum budget, but within reach. After her friends, her broker and an inspector vetted it in her absence, her offer at full asking price was accepted.
She returned to Seattle in November, seeing the house she’d only seen on video in person for the first time. “When I first saw it, I cried,” she said of the house with views of the Puget Sound. “I fell in love.”

The house gave her more space, but at a significant financial cost. In 2021, her priorities shifted, and she suddenly felt the burden of a huge mortgage. “I got super burned out at work,” she said. “I remember thinking, ‘Man, if I was still in that townhouse, I could just quit my job for a year and be fine.’ The mortgage was so low, I could take a year off, I could relax, I could refuel and now I really can’t. ”

More Work Than Expected
When Travis Parman got a new job in Lexington, Ky., he figured the housing market there would be more forgiving than the one in Nashville, where he had been living. “I thought it would be cheap and easy,” said Mr. Parman, 49, who started his job at AppHarvest, a tech start-up, in November 2020. “What I actually found out was that Lexington tends to be low on inventory.”
Mr. Parman started his search in November 2020. His husband, Andrew Kung, 43, a surgeon with the Navy, lives on a military base in Jacksonville, N.C., visiting on weekends. With a budget of $1 million, Mr. Parman imagined that he could find a picturesque historic property to be his forever home. Instead, he found extremely limited options. And the properties that were available were a far cry from the stately homes he envisioned.
“I walked into a lot of situations that were disasters,” he said.
Frustrated, he reset his expectations. Rather than look for the perfect home, he would find one that could work for the next five years. In a few years, when the market cooled, he could reassess. “The compromise that I made was really saying: ‘This is going to require a renovation, but it’s cosmetic,’” he said.

With a more measured goal in mind, he found a 3,600-square-foot four square style house in a historic neighborhood close enough to the office that he could bike to work. With canary yellow walls, dated track lighting and decorative kitchen tiles adorned with herbs, it seemed like a house that only needed modest upgrades, the types of improvements that let a homeowner put their own stamp on a space. He closed in January 2021, figuring the renovations would take three months.

But not all repairs are immediately visible, or caught during an inspection. By summer, the central air conditioning, which was 20 years old, failed. Replacing it cost $5,000. The spring revealed a dead 100-year-old pin oak on the property, another $5,000 bill, although the city shared in the cost of removal.
His list of simple upgrades to the décor collided with pandemic delays and cost increases. He struggled to find dining tables, light fixtures and wall coverings. “We wound up having to, in many cases, choose second, third or fourth options because materials or pieces just weren’t available,” he said. The three-month job has stretched to nearly a year.
What he wanted: A historic home in excellent condition in Lexington for under $1 million
What he bought: A four-bedroom home in need of repairs in Lexington for $653,000
What he learned: Mr. Parman learned that even minor improvements can take longer than expected, and not all larger problems are immediately apparent. In hindsight, he said he wished he’d researched the life span of the mechanicals, like the air conditioning, to avoid unexpected bills.
However, he found that by lowering his expectations for the kind of home he needed, he was able to find something that he could live with for the next few years.
“This does not have to be your forever home,” he said. “This does not have to be perfect.”
It just has to work for now.

Steph Vaye had to adjust her wish list when she was looking for an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “I had this expectation of the size of my apartment and I thought it was going to be larger,” she said.

After spending almost a year traveling through Mexico and Costa Rica, Steph Vaye returned to New York in September 2021 eager to buy an apartment. She had two requirements: the apartment had to be in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and it could not be a studio.
Three days after Ms. Vaye, 29, started her search, an apartment came on the market that checked all her boxes. Listed for $599,000, it had an open kitchen and a large balcony. “This was a dream apartment,” she said.
She offered the full asking price, but with multiple offers already on the table, she bumped hers up to $655,000, over her $650,000 budget. Her offer was rejected anyway.

“I’m a single woman. I was competing against couples who might have double my income,” said Ms. Vaye, who works for nate, a shopping app.
The first rejection motivated her. “Once you start looking, it becomes an addiction and you just want to move,” she said.
Her broker, Molly Franklin, a saleswoman at Corcoran, showed her six more apartments in Williamsburg, and she bid on three. Two needed work. The third, at 484 square feet, was tiny, far smaller than any of the other options. But it had a balcony and was in a luxury building with an elevator, roof deck and a swimming pool.
“I had this expectation of the size of my apartment,” she said. “I thought it was going to be larger.”
Listed for $569,000, the apartment was well within her budget. Unlike the other options, it did not need work. She initially thought she’d be willing to renovate, but once the options were in front of her, she realized she wasn’t up for the work. “I was not prepared to remodel,” she said. “I needed something that was turnkey.”

She decided she could live with the tiny size because the apartment had an open floor plan, storage space and the amenities gave her options to entertain elsewhere. She closed on the apartment in November 2021.

2022-02-05,"As a kid growing up in the Minneapolis suburbs during the ’90s, Nick Green’s kitchen cupboard was not like his friends’ kitchen cupboards. There were no salty snacks, no sugary cereal, no soda. Even Honey Nut Cheerios were verboten.
His mother, part of a large Mexican American family, had seen how the modern diet led to so many health problems for her relatives, and resolved to raise her own children with minimal processed foods.
Mr. Green said being deprived of traditional sweets and snacks was frustrating — and that he raided his friends’ kitchens when he had the chance — but that he was ultimately grateful for the strict diet early in life, believing it gave him good habits and good health.
It also gave Mr. Green the foundation of a billion-dollar idea.
After graduating from Harvard College, briefly working for McKinsey & Company and selling a test preparation company he founded, Mr. Green teamed up with a few other like-minded entrepreneurs to start Thrive Market, an online marketplace for healthy and eco-friendly food and household goods, in 2013.

Today, Thrive, which is still privately held, has more than a million members who pay $60 a year for the privilege of ordering chickpea pasta, plant-based cleaning products and organic wine.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
What was your childhood like and your family’s diet like?
I grew up very middle class in Minnesota. It was the era of not just the food pyramid with bread on the bottom, but fortified junk food, two-liter bottles of soda at the dinner table, that kind of thing. And I had a very different household. My mom came from a large Mexican American family. And she saw family members struggling with diabetes, with obesity, heart disease and cancer.
She was really obsessed with changing that trajectory for our family, and I saw how hard she had to work to do it. There wasn’t a healthy retailer nearby. So we were that weird house on the block that had no sugared cereal, no good snacks, no soda.
As a kid and a teenager, didn’t that drive you crazy?
Yeah. I was the total glutton if I went to a friend’s house.

Were you focused on food professionally from the get-go?
There was a period when I got out of the house where I definitely wasn’t focused on it. I wouldn’t call my college years particularly healthy. But as I got into my 20s and I started working hard, I very much realized how much diet and exercise made a difference in my ability to maintain that pace. I was doing Paleo back in 2007 before it was a thing. I was fasting.
What’s the biggest professional mistake you ever made, and what did you learn from it?
The biggest professional mistake I ever made was actually the summer I decided to get a real job. After my junior year at Harvard, everybody was doing consulting or investment banking, and I decided I needed to also. So I spent the summer at McKinsey and the people were amazing. The work was interesting, but it just didn’t inspire me the way that entrepreneurship did. So it was actually the mistake that clarified my path most, because if I could go to a place that had the pedigree, it had amazing people and was intellectually stimulating and it still wasn’t filling me up, I knew I had to start something myself.
What happened when the pandemic hit? A lot of businesses fell off the cliff.
The acute phase of the pandemic was a really unique moment. You went from some people thinking about their health to literally everybody thinking about health. You went from some people shopping online to everybody shopping online. So we had to respond by scaling.
One of the big challenges initially was, how do we keep our fulfillment centers operating and our workers safe? Two-thirds of our employees are in those fulfillment centers, and they were truly the heroes of that acute phase.
Beyond all the craziness of that acute phase, the pandemic has accelerated secular trends we were already betting on as a business. People are more socially in tune and more focused on the environment, more conscious of health today than they were two years ago. And then e-commerce. We’ve had two years of people habituating more and more in the direction of shopping online. And I think a lot of that behavior has stuck.

What do you think the biggest obstacle to getting people to eat healthy is these days in America?
There are multiple barriers. One is just cost. Organic and natural products tend to be priced at a premium. Another is geography. Half of Americans don’t live within driving distance of a healthy retailer. But I think the biggest one is more emotional barriers. Where do I start? Can I trust these products? It’s overwhelming. It’s intimidating. If you go onto Amazon and search for almond butter, you’re going to find 9,000 results. Where do I go with that?
We want to break down each of the barriers to conscious living. We want to make it affordable. We also want to make it really easy and really seamless.
I’m surprised you didn’t mention the fast-food industry and the relentless marketing of unhealthy food.
Look, that’s going to be there. These are big businesses with a lot of money and they can dominate the airwaves. What’s encouraging to me is that in spite of that, you have this shift in attitudes. You have more people wanting to get healthy and you have more people becoming more conscious of social and environmental issues. And that awakening is not something that is just on the coasts or just with affluent consumers.
Are you aware of any sort of partisan or political dynamics among your member base?
That’s honestly not important to us. I think that getting healthy transcends political lines. Everyone wants their families, their communities to do better. And the causes that we allow our members to shop by also tend to transcend politics. Some, like local, and family owned, and kosher, are even traditionally associated with more conservative values. We think about ourselves as really a platform. It’s not about imposing our political values or catering to one type of group. It’s about letting people vote with their dollars for what they care about most.

You’ve hired quite a bit over the last 20 months or so, and this is a mission-driven company. How do you make sure that you’re getting the right people when you can’t actually meet them?
It’s really important to get the right people in our fulfillment centers. We’re not looking to be a revolving door. We want to provide long-term work and that means providing good pay, but also good benefits, an opportunity to earn equity, a culture where they feel respected and valued. I think that is really unique to typical fulfillment center jobs, and it’s given us a big advantage in attracting really talented people who are really connected and work hard for us and stick around.
As for how do you hire somebody when you’re not going to meet them in person? It’s extraordinarily hard. You just don’t build relationships over email and Slack. And there is something, we believe, that is really important in actually being physically present.
What do you think is one of the biggest misconceptions people have about what makes for good leadership today?
People probably overemphasize the importance of decisiveness and action. Both are very important as a leader. But I think very often, just as important is listening and seeking perspectives. I’ve had a number of humbling mistakes that I’ve made, most of which were because I moved too fast and thought I had the answer. And I’ve been consistently amazed when I go into the organization to get feedback, how insightful and how much knowledge and understanding and perspective there is when you listen to your people.

How do you explain the anti-vaccine, anti-authoritarian conspiracy-theories streak among some wellness influencers? Where does that come from?
I think it has less to do with health and more to do with politics. Unfortunately, some of these topics that should be questions of personal health or public health have gotten wrapped up in politics and become issues of freedom and just the political dynamics. The whole, you know, mask vs. no mask, vaccine versus no vaccine, it’s really sad that these are issues where we’re not looking at efficacy and at facts, and instead we’re looking at political affiliations and tribalism.
Is that “Collapse” by Jared Diamond on your bookshelf?
Yeah. I read that like a decade ago, and I think it’s relevant again.
In what particular regard? Environmental collapse? Or are you thinking about the state of our democracy, for example?
All of the above. Not to say that we’re on the brink in any of those dimensions, but I do think it’s a reminder that things that look like they can go on forever don’t necessarily. I think we’re seeing some of that with where things have gone politically in our country. I think we’re seeing it certainly with threats to the environment."
2022-02-06,"Adrian Jean Pineda had an entry-level job at a Home Depot in 2018, working as a vault associate in Tempe, Ariz., in charge of counting the money from registers, placing it in sealed bags and depositing it at a local Wells Fargo Bank.
Over the next four years, however, the bank found $100 bills from the store’s deposits with “PLAYMONEY” written as a serial number — a clear sign of prop currency, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court.
The problem continued, losses ballooned and, in December, Home Depot contacted the U.S. Secret Service. The agency charged Mr. Pineda last month with swapping $387,500 of the store’s real cash with fake bills.
“He was just in a really good position to do the crime,” Frank Boudreaux Jr., the special agent in charge with the U.S. Secret Service’s office in Phoenix, said on Sunday. He added that it was rare that someone would pass so much counterfeit money before being caught.

Messages left at phone numbers listed as belonging to Mr. Pineda were not immediately returned on Sunday. A manager at the store where Mr. Pineda worked declined to be interviewed, and a company representative could not be immediately reached.
The scheme began in January 2018, according to the complaint, and started to unravel late last year after Home Depot detected a large number of fake bills coming from one particular store, Mr. Boudreaux said.
Mr. Pineda bought from Amazon prop $100 bills, which are used for parties and pranks and in television and movie productions. The bills are accurately scaled to size and contain text found on real ones. He brought to work about $800 to $1,200 of the fake currency at a time, Mr. Boudreaux said.
After cashiers brought Mr. Pineda the day’s receipts from the registers, he would swap real bills with fake ones, shoving crumpled fistfuls of real money into his pocket, the complaint said. Video surveillance cameras caught him doing this at least 16 times, the complaint said.
The prop bills, which cost $8.96 for a pack of 100 individual $100 bills, look “highly realistic,” Mr. Boudreaux said. They feature a perfectly printed Benjamin Franklin and, next to his face, a vertical blue line, similar to the 3-D security ribbon found on actual bills.

But the similarities stop when it comes to texture. Real bills, which are made of cotton and linen, have a thicker feel. Fake bills feel papery, like a page out of a notebook, Mr. Boudreaux said.
Still, the prop bills that Amazon and other stores sell do cause trouble for investigators. “I wish they didn’t sell it,” Mr. Boudreaux said.
Peter Kadushin, an Amazon spokesman, said in a statement on Monday that the company’s policy forbids imitation currency “that is not prominently and permanently marked ‘COPY’ in the English language.”
As Mr. Pineda racked up more and more real money, his lifestyle began to exceed the typical budget for someone in his position, Mr. Boudreaux said. For instance, he paid for a personal trainer and a new car.
“It was evident that he was spending much more than he was making,” said Mr. Boudreaux, who did not know how much Mr. Pineda was earning.

When Mr. Boudreaux and his colleagues began their investigation, they subpoenaed Mr. Pineda’s Amazon records and found a peculiar and revealing statistic. The total worth of all the fake bills Mr. Pineda had bought was roughly the same as the total loss attributed to fake money at the Home Depot store.
“So that kind of tied it all together,” Mr. Boudreaux said.
At about 4 a.m. on Jan. 31, Mr. Pineda arrived at work to begin his shift. That’s when a Home Depot manager confronted him, according to the complaint, which said that Mr. Pineda admitted to the manager that he had indeed been swapping the money.
Mr. Pineda was charged with a violation of the federal code known as uttering of counterfeit U.S. currency, according to a news release. Mr. Pineda, who is scheduled to appear in court on Monday, has agreed to pay restitution, Mr. Boudreaux said.
At the time of Mr. Pineda’s arrest, Secret Service agents seized $5,000 in counterfeit money and recovered $5,300 in genuine currency. An additional $22,000 in real currency was recovered at Mr. Pineda’s home.
Mr. Pineda was able to get away with the scheme for so long, Mr. Boudreaux said, because “he bypassed the first layer of counterfeit detection — the cashier.”"
2022-02-07,"The White House on Monday released a report outlining several dozen steps it intends to take to promote union membership and collective bargaining among both public and private sector employees.
The report is the product of a task force that President Biden created through an executive order in April. A White House statement said the president had accepted the task force’s nearly 70 recommendations.
Many of the steps would make it easier for federal workers and employees of contractors to unionize, including ensuring that union organizers have access to employees on federal property, which does not always happen today.
The report also recommends creating preferences in federal grant and loan programs for employers who have strong labor standards, preventing employers from spending federal contract money on anti-union campaigns and making employees aware of their organizing rights.

When the task force was created, some White House officials indicated that they supported considering labor union membership as a factor in awarding government contracts, but the task force recommendations generally did not emphasize this approach.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
Under federal procurement law, the government generally cannot deny contracts to companies it deems hostile to labor unions. But it may be able to consider a company’s posture toward unions as a factor in certain narrow cases — for example, when labor strife resulting from an aggressive anti-union campaign could substantially delay the provision of some important good or service.
The executive order Mr. Biden signed creating the task force required it to submit recommendations within 180 days, at which point the president would review them.
One key premise of the task force was that the National Labor Relations Act, the 1935 law that protects federal labor rights, explicitly encourages collective bargaining and yet, according to the Biden White House, no previous administration had explored ways that the executive branch could do so systematically.
The ambition of the task force was twofold: to enact policies for federal agencies and contractors that encourage unionization and to model best practices for employers in the public and private sectors.

The president’s task force will submit a second report describing progress on its recommendations and proposing additional ones in six months.
Union officials and labor experts consider Mr. Biden to be among the most pro-labor presidents ever. He moved quickly to oust Trump appointees viewed as unsympathetic to labor and to undo Trump-era rules that weakened protections for workers, and signed legislation that secured tens of billions of dollars to stabilize union pension plans.
Mr. Biden has occasionally used his bully pulpit to urge employers not to undermine workers’ labor rights or bargaining positions, as when he warned against coercing workers who were weighing unionizing during a prominent union election at Amazon last year. He later called Kellogg’s plan to permanently replace striking workers “an existential attack” on its union members.
Last week, Mr. Biden signed an executive order requiring so-called project labor agreements — agreements between construction unions and contractors that set wages and working conditions — on federal construction projects worth more than $35 million, a move that the White House estimates could affect nearly 200,000 workers. He previously signed an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour from $10.95.
But despite Mr. Biden’s backing, and polls showing widespread public support for unions, the rate of union membership nationwide remains stuck at a mere 10 percent, its lowest in decades.
The Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, which Mr. Biden supports, would make it easier to unionize by preventing companies from holding mandatory anti-union meetings and imposing financial penalties on employers that retaliate against workers seeking to unionize. It passed the House in March but remains a long shot in the Senate. Democrats may seek to pass some of its provisions along party lines this year."
2022-02-08,"WASHINGTON — The House on Tuesday approved the most significant overhaul of the Postal Service in nearly two decades, seeking to address the beleaguered agency’s financial woes and counter pandemic-era mail delays that became a flash point in the 2020 elections.
The service has teetered on the brink of insolvency for years, as repeated efforts to revamp its structure and finances have stalled in Congress. In 2020, a slowdown of mail delivery and a series of operational changes ahead of the election, in which a record number of votes were cast by mail because of the pandemic, prompted intense scrutiny and helped set off a renewed effort to address the agency’s troubles.
The House approved the measure 342 to 92.
A companion bill in the evenly divided Senate has bipartisan backing, including more than a dozen Republican co-sponsors, signaling sufficient support for the measure to move through that chamber and become law.
“I expect to move quickly to vote on these critical reforms that will help ensure the Postal Service’s long-term success,” said Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan and a champion of the companion bill, in a statement.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said in a statement that the Senate would take up the bill in the coming weeks
The Biden administration also signaled its support for the measure in a statement on Monday, saying it backs “efforts to strengthen the United States Postal Service, including by providing postal employees with the dignity, fair pay, and employer-provided benefits they have earned.”
Despite being a popular mainstay of American life, the Postal Service regularly fails to turn a profit, with 2020 marking the 14th consecutive year it incurred a net annual loss. Its revenue comes mostly from the sale of postage and other products, and without congressional action, lawmakers warned the agency could run out of cash by 2024.
During a meeting with the Postal Service’s Board of Governors on Tuesday, Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, called the bill “long overdue legislation,” according to a transcript of the meeting. He praised lawmakers involved in the measure and expressed optimism that the Senate would soon take up the bill, which he described as “legislation that is vital to the United States Postal Service and the American people.”

To address the financial strain on the agency, the bill requires retired employees to enroll in Medicare when they are eligible and removes a mandate, first imposed by a 2006 law, that the agency cover its future health care costs decades in advance. The Postal Service estimates that those two changes will save the agency about $50 billion over a decade, according to a fact sheet provided by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, whose leaders led efforts to draft the legislation. The committee said it would be the most significant overhaul of the agency in nearly two decades.

The measure also would require the agency to publish delivery data that customers could search using a street address, ZIP code or post office box, as well as mandating the agency maintain a delivery standard of at least six days a week. A 10-year strategic plan issued by the Postal Service in March that proposed reducing hours and lengthening delivery times drew immediate pushback from Democrats.
In the months leading up to the 2020 election, Democrats also sparred with Mr. DeJoy, a Trump megadonor, over a series of cost-cutting measures that eliminated overtime for carriers, reduced post office hours and removed postal boxes. He decided to suspend those changes until after the 2020 election after criticism that they could curtail vote-by-mail efforts amid the pandemic.
The bill passed on Tuesday also would expand special rates for local newspaper distribution, and would also require regular reports to Congress about the agency’s financial state.
The legislation was led by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the oversight committee, and its top Republican, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky.

“It’s an American value — I wanted to do everything I could to preserve it,” Ms. Maloney said in an interview. “It’s a problem that needed to be fixed.”
In remarks on the House floor, Mr. Comer noted that the legislation is projected to save federal dollars with its reforms, adding that “this targeted bill addresses the immediate needs of the Postal Service to help it succeed into the 21st century.”
Lawmakers collected a series of letters of support from companies and outside groups to illustrate the widespread support for the legislation, including from Hallmark Cards and the Greeting Card Association.
Brian Huseman, the vice president of public policy at Amazon, said the legislation would “ensure the agency can continue to provide reliable service to the American people and serve as an excellent delivery and logistics provider in the years ahead.”"
2022-02-09,"The family at the center of the poignant comedy “The Fabulous Filipino Brothers” is a raucous and big-hearted bunch. The Abasta siblings are prone to bickering, but they’re just as quick to offer support. The chemistry apparent in this portrait of a tight-knit Filipino American family isn’t faked: The Abastas are played by real siblings, the Bascos, who have been working in film and television for decades. One of them, Dante Basco, directs, and he and his brother Darion wrote the story together.
The movie revolves around preparations for a Filipino wedding in their hometown, Pittsburg, Calif. The film’s structure is episodic, following the siblings one at a time as they prepare for, attend and recover from the wedding. Derek Basco plays Dayo, the eldest brother, who has taken on responsibility for the food at the reception. Dante Basco is Duke, a successful businessman who is tempted to change his life after an encounter with a former lover. David (Dionysio Basco) is the party boy and, most movingly, there is Darion Basco as Danny, the depressed middle child whose spirits are revived by a date with a woman he meets online Teresa (Liza Lapira). The one sister, Doris (Arianna Basco), acts as the movie’s narrator.
The plot is loose, more oriented toward hanging out with its characters than in driving them to revelations or catharsis. But the director ties the eclectic siblings together through the dialogue, which frequently contemplates the family’s Filipino identity, and through the use of color. Every frame is flush with warm, saturated color, and the vibrant quality of the images conveys joyous generosity. The most poignant appeal of this movie is the feeling it creates of being welcomed into a family that radiates all things bright and good.

2022-02-10,"The retailer Kohl’s is under increasing pressure on multiple fronts. On Thursday, the activist investment firm Macellum Advisors, which has been fighting for changes at Kohl’s for more than a year, sought to take over the retailer’s board as part of its push to persuade the company to sell itself.
Kohl’s has recently received takeover approaches but rejected them as too low. Last week, it said it had hired the investment bank PJT Partners and Goldman Sachs to field any further interest. It also put in place a “poison pill” provision that makes it harder for an acquirer to put a bid directly to Kohl’s shareholders. It made an exception for “qualified” offers, which requires the bids to be fully financed, among other conditions.
In its push for a sale, Macellum said it was convinced “more than ever” that the retailer’s board needed to be refreshed — it has proposed a slate of 10 candidates. Macellum, which owns about 5 percent of Kohl’s shares, struck a settlement with the retailer in April that included the addition of three new directors to its 14-seat board. All members of Kohl’s board, aside from its chief executive, Michelle Gass, are independent. The chairman, Frank Sica, is not standing for re-election to the board.
Kohl’s called Macellum’s effort to take control of its board “unjustified and counterproductive.”
Several potential suitors for Kohl’s have recently emerged:
Acacia Research, which is backed by the activist investment firm Starboard Value, last month offered $9 billion, which was 37 percent higher than Kohl’s market value at the time.
The private equity firm Sycamore Partners has also expressed interest in bidding.
Leonard Green & Partners, a private equity firm, has reached out to Kohl’s about a potential bid, first reported by the DealBook newsletter. The firm, which has deep retail expertise, previously tried to lead a management buyout of Nordstrom.
Like most department stores, Kohl’s has struggled to fend off competition from online retailers and brands themselves, which are increasingly sidestepping department stores altogether. It has worked to carve out a place for itself by focusing in part on athleisure wear, which makes up more than a quarter of its sales.

Analysts have lauded Kohl’s for creative use of its real estate, like partnerships with Amazon and Sephora, to rethink profitability of its more than 1,000 stores. But they have also warned about the potential impact of supply chain challenges on sales.
Kohl’s in November reported a 16 percent jump in quarterly revenue. Its shares are up more than 20 percent this year, fueled by the takeover interest."

2022-02-12,"Walmart said on Friday that fully vaccinated employees would no longer have to wear masks unless state or local rules required it. The change is effective immediately, the giant retailer said in a memo to its staff.
Unvaccinated employees must continue to wear masks in its stores and offices until further notice, the memo said.
Walmart said it had made the decision after closely monitoring Covid trends across the country. It came at the end of a week in which Democratic governors from Connecticut to California began to lift statewide masking policies as coronavirus cases fueled by the Omicron variant were dropping precipitously, and it is in line with similar announcements from other companies. Amazon said on Thursday that vaccinated employees in warehouses in states that had dropped mask mandates could opt out of wearing masks as well.
Walmart, which has about 1.6 million employees in the United States alone, was among the first private employers at the start of the pandemic to mandate that its workers wear masks. The company eased the mask requirement for vaccinated workers and shoppers for several months in the spring before reimposing it yet again for some workers when the Delta variant posed a significant threat. Then, in December as new cases driven by Omicron began to surge, the company again required masks for all workers.
The company also said that a pandemic sick-pay plan that had been in place for the past two years to cover Covid-related illnesses would end on March 31, unless it was required by state or local governments. The memo also said that daily health screenings before each shift would no longer be necessary for workers, except those in California, New York and Virginia."
2022-02-13,"In 2009, Anthony Casalena was listening to a lot of podcasts, especially one called “This Week in Tech,” a round table where tech reporters gathered to talk about things like Farmville, Foursquare and the iFart app.
Though the website building business he started in his dorm room six years before had yet to make a profit, he decided to make a big bet. He spent around $20,000 for an ad on the show to tell listeners about Squarespace.
“It was so expensive compared to anything else I had done,” he said over Zoom from his vacation house in Montauk, N.Y., in September. By this fall, he was working on an ad campaign on a somewhat larger scale — including the Sunday Super Bowl ad starring Zendaya.
How Squarespace went from podcast spots to Super Bowl ads shows that his 2009 bet was right. Podcasts could sell.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
To find out if that gamble on his first podcast ad on This Week in Tech worked, Squarespace built one of the earliest post-purchase surveys, the ones companies now pepper customers with. When he looked at the results, Mr. Casalena was shocked. A third of the company’s new subscribers had heard of its product from the ad on This Week in Tech.
“So we became pioneers in trying to find every emerging show host we could before they’re super popular,” Mr. Casalena said. Everyone at Squarespace started hunting for podcasts to advertise on.
When a podcast host ad-libbed their promotional copy — and particularly if they stressed that using the Squarespace promo code supported their show — the return on the ad spending was enormous. And, according to a former Squarespace employee, when that host was Joe Rogan, the return was almost unbelievable.
Other people later discovered the same about Mr. Rogan, who started podcasting the same year Squarespace started advertising. In 2020 Spotify offered him a reported $100 million for his show.
It has also, in recent days, apologized for him. After several artists pulled their music from Spotify because they believed Mr. Rogan promoted Covid-19 misinformation, and his past use of racial slurs drew new attention, Spotify’s chief executive sent his staff an email saying “there are no words I can say to adequately convey how deeply sorry I am.” (Mr. Rogan also apologized for what he called “shameful” language.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The controversy erupted several months after Mr. Casalena and I spoke and, through a spokesman, he declined to comment on Mr. Rogan.
The success with podcast ads made Mr. Casalena such a believer in advertising that in 2015, he decided to buy a 30-second Super Bowl ad that he figures cost him $10 million. “It’s a good deal,” he said. “What other ad do we do that gets picked up in the media over like a hundred different sources and played for free?” It is very hard to argue with that point here.
Mr. Casalena’s commitment to podcast advertising was so singular even in 2015 that when President Barack Obama — years from being a podcaster himself — went on Marc Maron’s show, Squarespace was the only company approached about ads.
Ilyas Frenkel, Squarespace’s growth marketing manager at the time, received that call from Midroll Media, the company that sold Mr. Maron’s ads. Mr. Frenkel asked the salesperson who Mr. Maron was interviewing that put the ad rate at $100,000. “He couldn’t tell me but he said, ‘You have to do it.’ We said, ‘OK,’” Mr. Frenkel said.
That year, FiveThirtyEight tracked the biggest podcast advertisers, and it found that Squarespace was taking out two-and-half as many ads as its nearest competitor, Stamps.com.

The company was advertising on more than 400 podcasts a month. According to a former Midroll employee, the company had an internal meeting because the executives were concerned that one account, Squarespace, accounted for a third of the revenue.
Squarespace’s team purchasing ads on Facebook and Google would get grilled in meetings, because their return on what they spent on ads couldn’t compete with the team placing ads on podcasts and YouTube videos.
The podcast ad budget grew so large that the team of four young people couldn’t spend it all. According to the former employee, at one point, Squarespace discussed taking out ads that didn’t even talk about Squarespace and just promoted Podcast Awareness month, something they were going to make up. Squarespace employees were the only group of people in the world who have ever thought there weren’t enough podcasts.
Squarespace ad buyers were agnostic about audience size. If they spent $500 on a podcast with a tiny audience and scored 20 subscribers, it was worth it — because people who pay an annual fee to host their website aren’t likely to leave and redesign their site somewhere else.
Squarespace gets mocked for being the podcast-ad company, but Mr. Casalena revels in the attention, rattling off mentions on “Saturday Night Live,” the Netflix show “Only Murders in the Building” and J. Cole’s song “My Life.” (“I think he just really needed something that rhymes with ‘airspace,” Mr. Casalena said.)

Dax Shepard said he heard Squarespace ads so much on his favorite podcasts that he believed their ads helped legitimize his show when he started reading them. “It one of the few ads I know by heart,” Mr. Shepard explained in an email. “It’s a party trick.”
Mr. Casalena said that since he founded the company, he has spent over $1 billion promoting his brand across all platforms. The revenue from those ads, plus all that attention, helped the company go public in May, landing Mr. Casalena himself $2.4 billion in stock in the $6.6 billion company.
Long before anyone came up with the idea of Web3 (the name for a decentralized internet run on crypto tokens), Mr. Casalena understood that people were looking to monetize every interaction in their lives.
He saw that Squarespace’s small business owners were selling services along with goods. Online classes. Tattoo appointments. Tutoring. Tarot card reading. The internet rule “information wants to be free” was starting to deteriorate.
“People were able to get audiences in ways they couldn’t get them before via the social networks. But they don’t want to be beholden to the social networks,” Mr. Casalena said.

He is now betting on a world in which people’s social media accounts reviewing wine or dispensing makeup tips become their main businesses. “We see this larger opportunity now around selling time,” Mr. Casalena said.
In 2019, Squarespace made its first acquisition, buying Acuity Scheduling, which helps businesses with online appointments. In March 2021, it bought Tock, which helps restaurants and wineries manage reservations and takeout orders, for more than $400 million.

After a 2021 Super Bowl ad in which Dolly Parton extolled the side hustle angered people who felt exploited by the gig economy (“5 to 9,” she sang), Squarespace refined its service-economy-forward message with a campaign featuring John McEnroe.
The former tennis great had stumbled into a new line of work — doing voice overs — and in the ad (and the seven-minute mockumentary accompanying the campaign), Mr. McEnroe uses Squarespace to promote his voice-over career.

To help everyone on the journey from person to brand, Squarespace created its new Video Studio app, which provides a library of images as well as voices you can access simply by typing. A company that started advertising on podcasts essentially changed its business to help people make podcasts.
The decentralized economy, Squarespace predicts, will be all side hustle, all the time. “The part of the economy that will be less commoditized is our individual experiences,” said Nick Kokonas, the derivatives trader turned Chicago restaurateur who founded Tock.
If 10 different merchants on Amazon are selling the same product, he can buy the cheapest one. “But food isn’t like that. And personal training isn’t like that. Those people whose marketplace used to be hyperlocal, this gives them global reach,” he said.
Mr. Kokonas believes that most businesses selling goods will add a service component, a trend called multimodal spending that the pandemic sped up.
In this year’s Super Bowl ad, Zendaya plays a woman selling seashells who uses Squarespace to offer seashell meditation sessions and a seashell travel, becoming a “seashell celebrity.” Which is a not a completely improbable job description in 2022. No doubt, she’ll also have a podcast."
2022-02-14,"In the compact documentary “Somewhere With No Bridges,” the director Charles Frank sets out to put a heartbeat to a memory. The movie’s ostensible subject, Richie Madeiras, was 44 in October 1999 when he fell from his boat. Days later, divers pulled his body from the water a few hundred yards off Martha’s Vineyard, where he had deep roots, made lifelong friends and worked as a shellfish constable helping to protect the island’s precious natural resources. A local paper said of Madeiras: “Friends and family say he was born to fish.”
The genesis of this documentary was the enduring impact that Madeiras’s death had on friends and family, including on Frank’s father, Dale. Charles Frank was just about to turn 5 in October 1999. “My family likes to joke that before the age of 12, I don’t remember anything,” he says in voice-over soon after the movie begins. That isn’t true, he continues, as the camera holds on a handsomely framed aerial shot of lapping ocean waves. He remembers how his father reacted to the loss of his close friend.
“He stepped out of his car and collapsed into my mother’s arms,” Charles says, as the waves keep coming and he methodically draws out the words, as if from the deep. “It was the first time I sensed that something was wrong, and it was the first time I saw him cry.”
This childhood memory serves as a kind of creative statement of intent and an emotional through line for “Somewhere With No Bridges,” which seeks to explore Madeiras’s life and legacy through its many traces. This effort emerges piecemeal through a combination of archival imagery, original interviews and supplementary material, including a great many shimmering beauty shots of the island and its residents, though primarily men, on the water. Much like the photograph of Madeiras that Frank develops in an old-fashioned chemical bath, the documentary tries to turn a shadow into a portrait.
That never satisfyingly happens, partly because Frank never figures out what story he’s trying to tell: his, his father’s or Madeiras’s. Richie appears to have been a vividly charismatic, memorable figure, one who, decades after his death, his friends and family easily conjure up with tears and sweet and rollicking reminiscences. He was strong, mischievous and could take on a couple of guys at a bar all by himself. He loved, and he was loved in turn. Yet even as Frank keeps questioning and exploring, Madeiras and the full sweep of his life remain as out of focus as this documentary, an essay without a coherent thesis."
2022-02-15,"On Tuesday, Shari Redstone staged her second hourslong investor presentation in two years. Both events were designed for the same purpose — to reposition her old-line media company, ViacomCBS, as a streaming giant in the making, one capable of competing head-on with Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video, despite a late start.
This time, there was less snickering.
“Some of you thought we were on an impossible mission,” Robert M. Bakish, the chief executive of ViacomCBS, said during the presentation on Tuesday. “It’s not only possible. It’s happening.”
To highlight the importance of its fast-growing Paramount+ streaming service, Ms. Redstone, the company’s chair, announced that ViacomCBS would rename itself Paramount Global.
Paramount+ had 32.8 million subscribers worldwide at the end of its most recent quarter, up from fewer than 19 million a year earlier. In the three months that ended on Dec. 31, Paramount+ added 7.3 million customers, the result of offerings like “1883,” the prequel to “Yellowstone”; “Clifford the Big Red Dog”; and National Football League games. (A year earlier, ViacomCBS was adding about a million streaming subscribers a quarter.)

The company’s streaming portfolio (Paramount+ and niche services from Showtime, BET and Nickelodeon) now has about 56 million subscribers. Mr. Bakish said that number would grow to 100 million by 2024, more than the roughly 70 million the company had previously forecast. The company also raised its 2024 streaming revenue goal to $9 billion, from $6 billion.
Streaming brought in about $4.2 billion last year, including advertising sales from the free Pluto TV service.
Paramount+ unveiled a barrage of additional programming to fuel continued growth. The expanded lineup will include fresh content from franchises including “Yellowstone,” “Beavis and Butt-Head,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” “Real World,” “Dora the Explorer,” “NCIS,” “SpongeBob SquarePants,” “Transformers” and “South Park.” Paramount+ will be the exclusive first stop after theatrical distribution for all Paramount Pictures movies beginning in 2024. (Many previously went to Epix, a premium cable channel.)
Starting this summer in the United States, Paramount+ subscribers will be able to upgrade to receive Showtime content, including the new hit drama “Yellowjackets” and older series like “Billions.”
ViacomCBS shares declined about 6 percent in after-hours trading. Richard Greenfield, a founder of the research firm LightShed Partners, cited investor concern about Mr. Bakish’s “meaningfully stepping up spending” on content.

It may be growing quickly, but Paramount+ continues to lag behind competitors like Disney+, which added 11.8 million subscribers worldwide in its most recent quarter to reach 129.8 million. Netflix has about 222 million."

Kelly Marshall for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Roscoe Betsill. Prop Stylist: Maeve Sheridan.
Good morning. We’ve got a whole world of hearty stews and braises waiting for you right now, balms against winter’s bite. Take a look at Yewande Komolafe’s new recipe for eintopf (above), the hearty German stew. She learned to make the dish from her parents, who picked it up when they were graduate students in Berlin, a simple one-pot preparation of braised short ribs with fennel, squash and sweet potato that could provide meals for a week.
Once you’ve finished those leftovers, you can move on to a perennial favorite: old-fashioned beef stew, one of the most popular recipes on New York Times Cooking and a standing testament to the excellence of Molly O’Neill, the longtime Times columnist who developed the recipe in 1994. You should make that stew sometime soon, particularly if you haven’t already.
Consider as well this terrific pressure-cooker Guinness beef stew with horseradish cream from Sarah DiGregorio, with its velvety, roux-based braising sauce. Ponder this fresh and wild mushroom stew from David Tanis, or this exceptional brown stew chicken from Millie Peartree. And if it’s even more old-fashioned than Molly’s, Craig Claiborne’s beef stew is no less flavorful. (Regina Shrambling’s Dijon and Cognac beef stew may even be a little more so.)
Three sisters stew? Chickpea and winter vegetable stew? Pinakbet? You could be at it with a Dutch oven and fragrant, burbling excellence for the rest of the season.

Of course, plenty of us live in sunshine and warmth, even in February. Stew’s not always appropriate. A Sicilian-style citrus salad might be a better call for some, a halibut niçoise, maybe Melissa Clark’s latest: smoky roasted sweet potatoes with eggs and Marcona almonds.
Or you could make this sticky, flavor-packed curried roast chicken with grapefruit, honey and thyme, which puts me in a Los Angeles frame of mind, eating outside on a balcony, somewhere in West Hollywood.

Now, it’s nothing to do with celery root or the smell of a fresh mango (though peach pie does play a role), but I enjoyed “Reacher” on Amazon Prime. The drama is not quite as precise and analytical as the novels by Lee Child that inspired the series, but that’s fine. It’s still bingeable.
See what you think of this essay by TW Lim in The Prepared, about technology’s inability to automate the mortar and pestle, and how the rise and use of the food processor illustrates “the complicated ways in which technology incarnates economic history, and the cultural burling that results.”
A while back, I previewed “The Trojan Horse Affair,” the new podcast from Serial and The Times about the origins of a mysterious letter that led to a national scandal in Britain. Now that I’m through to the end, I’m circling back to say: It’s a must-listen.
Finally, here’s some new music to play while you’re stewing: Cate Le Bon, “Moderation.” Enjoy that, and I’ll be back on Friday."
2022-02-17,"Planning around naps, shelling out for nannies or yelling into the void — parents working from home all have ways of coping with the daily mayhem. For these intimate portraits — of anxiety, frustration and also unbridled joy — we visited the New York homes of working parents and photographed them during real video meetings at their jobs, occasionally donning noise-canceling headphones to preserve their offices’ privacy. All photos capture the natural reactions of both parent and child over the course of the meetings. (No babies were made to cry.)

For Sheena Demby, remote work as a new parent felt utterly paralyzing at the start. “The first time I had Noah Olivia in a meeting, I didn’t know what to do,” says Demby, who works as a creative-operations program manager at Cash App. “Out of desperation, I tried so hard to keep her out of the camera and to keep her quiet so that I could still present myself as, like, competent and doing great work. But the reality was, I could not keep this little baby from crying. I could not keep her from interrupting meetings. As a first-time mom and Black woman in corporate America — where I already felt I had to show above-average results just to be visible — I really struggled.” Noah Olivia is now almost 2, and Demby has brought a bit more of her personal life into the Zoom window. She keeps a rolling cart of diapers, wipes and work materials by her side so she can work alongside her daughter in any room of their Harlem apartment. Remote work is now Demby’s long-term plan: “I have zero intentions of ever going back into an office,” she says.

2022-02-19,"When we meet Sam, the 40-something protagonist of the HBO dramedy “Somebody Somewhere,” she has returned to her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., to care for her dying sister — and finds herself stuck there, single, unhappy, struggling with aging parents and a dead-end job. While her other sister runs a tchotchkes shop and her friend Joel creates vision boards, Sam seems to be moving away from, rather than toward, the objects of middle-class aspiration: marriage, children, job security.
At one point, she tells Joel she’s going to spend a Saturday writing up her goals and accomplishments, before chucklingly admitting her real plans: “I like to lay around drinking wine in my underwear.”
And why not? It’s a relief to see the women of small-screen comedy and dramedy turning their backs on ambition, personal growth and self-actualization. From “Enlightened” to “Broad City,” from “Girls” to “I May Destroy You,” female protagonists flout expectations that they be hard-working and socially responsible, gravitating instead toward indolence and self-sabotage. They quit their jobs when they get bored; they reject stable relationships, remunerative work and even personal dignity.

It may sound dangerous to celebrate all this narcissism, fecklessness and sloth, but it’s also liberating: Who among us has not wanted to ditch a boring job and set their wellness plans on fire? We were already exhausted before lockdowns and day care closures; now, nearly two years into this pandemic, “it’s as if our whole society is burned out,” wrote Noreen Malone in The New York Times Magazine.

“Somebody Somewhere” is a far cry from the single-girl sitcoms of the past, which have generally followed the arc of the bildungsroman, in which the protagonist develops self-reliance and self-respect, ready to meet the challenges of becoming an adult. These new story lines are, instead, versions of what the feminist scholar Susan Fraiman calls narratives of “unbecoming,” featuring protagonists who undermine their own growth and education, and are more likely to be mired in failure than striving toward wedding rings and corner offices.

Women antiheroes in mythology and literature have generally been murderous (Medea), scheming (Lady Macbeth), or unlikable (Scarlett O’Hara). Those who transgress societal norms, such as Edna Pontellier from “The Awakening” or Lily Bart of “The House of Mirth,” have often ended up dead — not surrounded by a community of like-minded misfits like the one Sam joins in “Somebody Somewhere.” That’s where the antihero of recent TV comedy tends to find her happy ending: in genuine community and friendship. There’s something bracing in this new female figure, and in watching her win on her own terms.
Obnoxious slackers are common enough in male-centered TV comedy. Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, and Louis C.K. are each defined by their selfishness and incompetence. But similar traits play differently in women; viewers may not warm to these male characters, but they don’t send the actors death threats like those the creator and star of “Girls,” Lena Dunham, has said she received. Female protagonists’ transgressing of gender norms in “unbecoming” narratives seems to anger viewers who desire compliance and amiability in women.

This is the crux of it. Because audiences expect cheery competence from women while tolerating laziness, violence and rule-breaking in men, the female antihero represents a far more profound threat to the status quo.

That status quo, set by the single-girl sitcoms of last century, was in its own time revolutionary, allowing women their own bildungsromans and turning the smart, sassy career woman into a cultural icon. The story begins with “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” Premiering in 1970, it follows the 30-year-old Mary Richards as she moves to Minneapolis, leaving behind her commitment-phobic boyfriend. She applies for a job as a secretary at a TV station, but she finds that it has been filled. Her sunny disposition earns her an associate producer spot instead. When Mary’s ex-boyfriend recognizes his mistake and tries to win her back, she promptly shows him the door. “Take care of yourself,” he tells her on his way out. “I think I just did,” Mary replies.
The single-girl TV comedies of the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s continued in this vein: “Murphy Brown,” “Designing Women,” “Living Single” and “Sex and the City” centered on plucky heroines committed to their careers while energetically seeking romantic relationships. More recent shows such as “New Girl,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Ugly Betty” offered contemporary spins on the formula by focusing on spirited young women who triumph over adversity. Characters like Liz Lemon of “30 Rock,” Leslie Knope of “Parks and Recreation” and Mindy Lahiri of “The Mindy Project” may be messy and demanding, but they’re also professional and upwardly mobile, sporting cute outfits and respectable jobs.

Some 40 years after “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” in 2012, Lena Dunham changed the narrative with “Girls,” one of the first and most influential “unbecoming” narratives. It too features a young single woman striking out on her own in search of love and opportunity, but there the parallels end. Ms. Dunham’s Hannah Horvath whines and manipulates her way through a landscape of millennial entitlement. Her prioritizing of her own happiness is as transgressive and alluring as her unabashed and frequent on-camera nakedness.
Hannah doesn’t share Mary Richards’s pluck or self-respect. “No one could ever hate me as much as I hate myself,” she confesses to her best friend in the show’s first season. Unlike Mary, whose effervescent optimism ensures she will always come out on top, Hannah often races to the bottom. While Mary talks her way into a cool job and dispatches with her prodigal boyfriend in the show’s first episode, Hannah gets fired from her unpaid internship and tolerates petty humiliations at the hands of her callous love interest.

The past few years have seen ever more examples of this new kind of female character — narcissistic, broke and wary of optimism. Shows such as “Fleabag,” “SMILF” and “This Way Up” are the products of the post-recessionary culture of the last decade and a half, when so many people are struggling financially and hard work and drive no longer seem to ensure success (if, indeed, they ever did). If so many of us are wearing ourselves out for corporations that treat workers as disposable, why not just kick back like Sam and drink wine in our underwear?
The heroine of the “unbecoming” narrative puts her likability at risk, a phenomenon that’s amplified for women of color, as illustrated by negative online comments about her appearance that Michaela Coel, the Black British writer, actor and creator of “I May Destroy You,” has endured. Perhaps this helps to explain why so many of TV comedy’s female antiheroes are white. Even worse, their edginess is often defined in relation to more stable characters of color who play sidekicks and foils, if they are present at all.

In a comedy that premiered on the Freeform network, “Single Drunk Female,” for instance, the white protagonist, Samantha, is surrounded by competent Black characters, from her therapist at rehab to her parole officer to the bar employee who gives her a bucket so that she won’t spray vomit on the wall (again). When Samantha indulges in abjection, her whiteness provides her some protection from scorn.

Samantha, like Sam from “Somebody Somewhere,” is no role model. But that’s precisely the point: At a time when women are being encouraged to rule the world, or, at the very least, expected to keep it together in a still-shaky Covid economy, the “unbecoming” heroine is a timely reminder that women need not be responsible, self-improving and productive to be valued.
And the arc of the unbecoming plot thankfully does not bend toward doom. Indeed, redemption of a different kind awaits the woman who makes space in her life for less conventional priorities. Sam finds it in friendship, and in the community of theater nerds and L.G.B.T.Q. folks at Joel’s weekly “choir practice.”
“I don’t know if I’m really friend material,” Sam confides to Joel at one point. He replies, “I think you’re going to surprise yourself.”

2022-02-20,"Maybe it was the date night when he and his wife spent two hours driving 19 miles to dinner, or the homeless encampment down the street, or the fact that homes were so expensive that his children could never afford to live near him.
Whatever the reasons, and there were many, Steve MacDonald decided he was done with Los Angeles. He wanted a city that was smaller and cheaper, big enough that he could find a decent restaurant but not so much that its problems felt unsolvable and every little task like an odyssey. After the pandemic hit and he and his wife went through a grand reprioritizing, they centered on Spokane, where their son went to college. They had always liked visiting and decided it would be a nice place to move.
Eastern Washington was of course much colder. Until this winter, Mr. MacDonald, a native Southern Californian, had never shoveled snow. But their new house is twice as big as their Los Angeles home, cost less than half as much and is a five-minute commute from City Hall, where Mr. MacDonald works as Spokane’s director of community and economic development.
He arrives each day to tackle a familiar conundrum: how to prevent Spokane from developing the same kinds of problems that people like him are moving there to escape.

“I’m realizing more and more how important the future prosperity of this city is about getting housing right,” he said. “If we don’t, it’s going to track more closely with what happened in Los Angeles.”
Mr. MacDonald knows the pattern, and so does everyone else who has been following the frenetic U.S. housing market for the past decade. The story plays out locally but is national in scope. It is the story of people leaving high-cost cities because they’ve been priced out or become fed up with how impossible the housing problem seems. Then it becomes the story of a city trying to tame prices by building more housing, followed by the story of neighbors fighting to prevent it, followed by the story of less expensive cities being deluged with buyers from more expensive cities, followed by the less expensive cities descending into the same problems and struggling with the same solutions.
It’s easier to change where we live than it is to change how we live.
Whether it’s Boise or Reno or Portland or Austin, the American housing market is caught in a vicious cycle of broken expectations that operates like a food chain: The sharks flee New York and Los Angeles and gobble up the housing in Austin and Portland, whose priced-out home buyers swim to the cheaper feeding grounds of places like Spokane. The cycle brings bitterness and “Don’t Move Here” bumper stickers — and in Spokane it has been supercharged during the pandemic and companies’ shift to remote work.
No matter how many times it happens, no matter how many cities and states try to blunt it with recommendations to build more housing and provide subsidies for those who can’t afford the new stuff, no matter how many zoning battles are fought or homeless camps lamented, no next city, as of yet, seems better prepared than the last one was.

Just a few years ago, a Spokane household that made the median income could afford about two-thirds of the homes on the market, according to Zillow. Now home prices are up 60 percent over the past two years, pricing out broad swaths of the populace and fomenting an escalating housing crisis marked by resentment, zoning fights and tents.

Being an “it” place was something Spokane’s leaders had long hoped for. The city and its metropolitan region have spent decades trying to convince out-of-town professionals and businesses that it would be a great place to move. Now their wish has been granted, and the city is grappling with the consequences.
Homelessness in America
New York City: An annual count by the city found more than 4,100 people sleeping on streets and in subways. It was the most since the city began keeping track nearly two decades ago.
A New Type of Care: Programs are sprouting across the country to provide nursing home and rehabilitation services to homeless people who would otherwise shuttle between hospitals and the street.
Making Music: Therapists from the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music have found that teaching homeless children to make beats and write songs is a way to heal trauma.
What Would Jesus Do?: The “Yes in God’s Backyard” movement to build affordable housing on faith organizations’ properties is gaining steam in California and elsewhere.
Growth is never perfect, and Spokane’s influx has been accompanied by a booming employment market that has increased wages, turned abandoned warehouses into offices and helped the city recover jobs lost during the pandemic. This is normally called progress. But for people who already lived in and around Spokane or the suburbs just across the border in north Idaho, the shift from living in a place that was broadly affordable to broadly not has come on with the suddenness of a car crash. Now many workers are wondering what the point of growth is if it only makes it harder to keep a roof over their head.
Even the mayor isn’t immune. In an interview, Nadine Woodward, a Republican who was elected in 2019, noted that her son and daughter-in-law, newlyweds who moved home during the pandemic, were living with her and her husband while they figured out where they could afford to settle. They came back to Spokane from Seattle, where they were long ago priced out. Austin was the next city on their list, but then its home prices shot up to about where Seattle’s were when they left. At this point, even Spokane is seeming pricey.
“I never thought I’d see the day where my adult children couldn’t afford a home in Spokane,” Ms. Woodward said.

Between Seattle and Minneapolis
Standing by a snow-covered lawn on an overcast afternoon, Steve Silbar, a local real estate agent who has been selling homes for five years, explained Spokane’s transformation in terms of a six-inch screen. When he thinks of a typical buyer, Mr. Silbar said, he imagines a couple thousands of miles away, perhaps on a beach, looking at their phones. They’re considering moving to a cheaper city, and do a search for homes.
Clients like this are why Mr. Silbar invested $3,000 in a camera that allows him to create three-dimensional tours of his listings, and why the exterior of every home he sells is showcased with an aerial video shot by a drone. In a market that attracts so many outsiders, a virtual walk through the interior and bird’s-eye flight over the street can be the nudge buyers need to bid on a home they’ve never entered, in a city they’ve never seen.
“I have to assume that the person that is looking at my listing has never been to Spokane, does not know about Spokane, has no clue,” Mr. Silbar said.

Spokane is the largest city on the road from Seattle to Minneapolis. This fact is frequently cited as the logic behind its economy: It’s between things. The city was incorporated in 1881 and grew into a transportation hub for the surrounding mining and logging industries. It remains a hub, only instead of shipping out timber and silver, businesses revolve around Fairchild Air Force Base and a collection of hospitals and universities that draw from the rural towns that stretch from eastern Washington to northern Idaho and into western Montana.

The transition from past to present plays out across a skyline in which the usual collection of anonymous bank and hotel towers is broken up by historic brick buildings that seem to be either in a state of abandonment or rehabilitation or occupied by low-rent tenants while waiting for redevelopment. The current boom has already made its mark in the form of new apartment towers, warehouses turned office buildings and an empty lot that will soon contain a 22-story building that will be the city’s tallest.
Driving around town, Michael Sharapata, a commercial real estate broker who moved to Spokane from the Bay Area in 2017, gave a staccato accounting of new leases, such as the millions of square feet that Amazon occupies out by the airport, or the satellite offices rented by various regional accounting and building firms.
His family is coming, too. After Mr. Sharapata and his wife moved north, they were followed, in rapid succession, by his brother-in-law in Austin, another brother-in-law in the Bay Area and his sister-in-law in Salt Lake City.
“We were looking for an affordable community that had an opportunity to accommodate all of us,” he said.
As in most of urban America, much of the growth in the Spokane area is on the fringes, where heavy equipment and the skeletal outlines of new subdivisions unfold in every direction and into Idaho. Building permits have surged, and the cadre of mostly local builders who had the market more or less to themselves now grumble that the rapid growth has attracted big national builders like D.R. Horton and Toll Brothers.

All of this happened fairly recently. In the years after the Great Recession, when homebuilders were in bankruptcy or hibernation, migration to the Spokane region plunged. That pattern shifted in 2014 when, as if a switch had been flipped, waves of migrants started arriving as already high-cost cities like Seattle and San Francisco saw their housing markets go into a tech-fueled frenzy.
By the end of 2014, migration to the Spokane region had jumped to more than 2,000 net new residents, compared with a net loss the year before, according to Equifax and Moody’s Analytics. Annual growth has only continued, rising further with the pandemic to more than 4,500 net new residents.
Sometimes they come for the chance to buy their first home. Other times it’s a bigger house or some land. Joel Sweeney, an academic adviser at Eastern Washington University, wanted the best of both: a single-family house on a quiet street that was close enough to downtown that he could walk to a good brewery. That sort of Goldilocks urbanity could cost a million in Austin, where he and his wife lived until last year. When they moved to Spokane they paid less than a third of that.
“You could not get a house for $299,000 in Austin where you could walk to a bunch of different stuff,” he said.

The white house with the red door sits on a quiet block near Gonzaga University. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom and 1,500 square feet of living space.
Mr. Silbar, the real estate agent, has sold it twice in the past three years. The first time, in November 2019, he represented a buyer who offered $168,000 and got it with zero drama. This year it went back on the market, and Mr. Silbar listed it for $250,000. Fourteen offers and a bidding war later, it closed at $300,000.
When Mr. Silbar got into the business, he said, his clients were “nurses and teachers,” and now they’re corporate managers, engineers and other professionals. “What you can afford in Spokane has completely changed,” he said.
The typical home in the Spokane area is worth $411,000, according to Zillow. That’s still vastly less expensive than markets like the San Francisco Bay Area ($1.4 million), Los Angeles ($878,000), Seattle ($734,000) and Portland ($550,000). But it’s dizzying (and enraging) to long-term residents.
Five years ago, a little over half the homes in the Spokane area sold for less than $200,000, and about 70 percent of its employed population could afford to buy a home, according to a recent report commissioned by the Spokane Association of Realtors. Now fewer than 5 percent of homes — a few dozen a month — sell for less than $200,000, and less than 15 percent of the area’s employed population can afford a home. A recent survey by Redfin, the real estate brokerage, showed that home buyers moving to Spokane in 2021 had a budget 23 percent higher than what locals had.

One of Mr. Silbar’s clients, Lindsey Simler, a 38-year-old nurse who grew up in Spokane, wants to buy a home in the $300,000 range but keeps losing out because she doesn’t have enough cash to compete. Spokane isn’t so competitive that it’s awash in all-cash offers, as some higher-priced markets are. But prices have shot up so fast that many homes are appraising for less than their sale price, forcing buyers to put up higher down payments to cover the difference.
A dozen failed offers later, Ms. Simler has decided to sit out the market for a while because the constant losing is so demoralizing. If prices don’t calm down, she said, she’s thinking about becoming a travel nurse. With the health care work force so depleted by Covid-19, travel nursing pays much better and, hopefully, will allow her to save more for a down payment.
“I’m not at the point where I want to give up on living in Spokane, because I have family here and it feels like home,” she said. “But travel nursing is going to be my next step if I haven’t been able to land a house.”
‘Positive activity’
From her seventh-floor office atop the Art Deco City Hall, Ms. Woodward, the mayor, looked out at the Spokane River, where in the warmer months a gondola glides past her window to a park built for the World’s Fair. Spokane hosted the fair in 1974 as a means of revitalizing its blighted downtown, and during the recent interview Ms. Woodward pointed out the window at cranes and construction sites that she calls “positive activity.”
Spokane’s job market is among of the strongest in the nation, and the virtuous economic cycle — of people coming for housing, causing businesses to come for people, causing more people to come for jobs — is in full swing. And yet, as in Seattle and California before and increasingly across the nation, the scourge of rising prices, particularly for rent and housing, makes it feel less virtuous than advertised.
The recent Realtors report warned of “significant social implications” if the city doesn’t tackle housing. The issues included young families not being able to buy or taking on excessive debt, small businesses not being able to hire, difficulty keeping young college graduates in town.
In the dominoes of the housing market, the disappointments of aspiring buyers like Ms. Simler get magnified as they move down to lower-income households. With homes so hard to buy, rents have shot up, and the vacancy rate for apartments is close to zero.
All of this has compounded at the lowest end of the market, where the nonprofit Volunteers of America’s Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho affiliate, which runs three shelters and maintains 240 apartments for people who were formerly homeless, said it will lose a quarter of its units in the next fiscal year as more of its funding goes to higher rents.

In December, as temperatures dropped and shelters filled, advocates and members of the homeless population protested by setting up several dozen tents on the City Hall steps. The encampment was gone two weeks later but has since been reconstructed on a patch of dirt on the other side of town. In the winter cold it smells like ash and soot from the open fires burning to keep people warm.

Last year, Ms. Woodward declared a housing emergency, and her administration has put in place initiatives that mirror those of housing-troubled cities on the West Coast. The city has built new shelters, is encouraging developers to repurpose commercial buildings into apartments, is making it easier for residents to build backyard units and is rezoning the city to allow duplexes and other multiunit buildings in single-family neighborhoods.
Ms. Woodward pointed to Kendall Yards, one of the developments outside her City Hall window, as an example of what she wanted to see more of. The mixed-density project could be a postcard picture of what economists and planners say is needed to combat the nation’s housing shortage and sprawl. In defiance of the single-family zoning laws that dictate the look of most U.S. neighborhoods, Kendall Yards has houses next to townhomes next to apartments, with retail and office mixed in.
People in town seem to love it, but are leery of there being more places like it, especially in their neighborhood.
“I think it’s awesome — I have friends there, and we go down there to the farmers’ market and walk around,” said John Schram, a co-chair of the neighborhood council in Spokane’s Comstock neighborhood. “That’s just not my vision of what I want for me. My concern is that I move into a neighborhood because of the way that it was designed when I got there, and when somebody else comes in and wants to change that I’m going to be concerned.”
He added: “I have nothing against duplexes and triplexes, just not next to my house.”"
2022-02-21,"On the Delmarva Peninsula, the low-lying expanse of coastal plain that bulges east from the Chesapeake Bay, some of the last remaining sizable green and wild spaces are wetland forests that shroud tidal rivers and creeks on their languid journeys toward the bay: the Nanticoke, the Marshyhope, the Choptank, the Tuckahoe, the Pocomoke.
As hard as it may be to believe in this long-settled part of the world, made up of Delaware and the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and Virginia, many of these forests remain virtually unexplored natural wonders. They are home to an explosive diversity of trees, shrubs and understory plants shaped by the rhythmic undulations of the tides, including rare and threatened species such as red turtlehead and seaside alder. They are havens for salamanders, lizards, woodpeckers, herons and more. The distinctive hill-and-hummock topography creates shallow pools where small fish shelter and forage; these fish feed bigger ones sought by fishermen and women.

One tree makes these wetlands possible: The ash. But now these trees face a formidable adversary. A few years ago, a small beetle showed up and started to change everything: the emerald ash borer, originally from Asia, was most likely a stowaway on a container ship and was discovered in Michigan in 2002. It is now found in 35 states and was confirmed on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in 2015. This invasive insect has killed tens of millions of ash trees in the United States and threatens millions more in its continuing path of destruction. On the Delmarva, it could upend entire ecosystems.

Unlike most trees, the ash tolerates the twice-daily surges of water in the Delmarva’s wetland forests. Its roots accumulate soil and build islands of life that stay above the high tide line. Scientists have a term for such species: “ecosystem engineers.” But resilient as they are, the trees die quickly once infested by the ash borer. The larvae tunnel under the bark and eat their way around the trunk until water and nutrients can no longer flow to keep the trees alive. A mature ash will probably be dead within a few years of becoming infested.

Nobody knows quite how long these tidal freshwater swamps have been here, but it is most likely several thousand years. They may have been logged, but most have never been drained, farmed or developed. Few people have entered these places on foot, because without boardwalks, they are nearly impenetrable. Even scientists have mostly ignored them, favoring other ecosystems like salt marshes.
A changing climate, a changing world
Card 1 of 4
Climate change around the world: In “Postcards From a World on Fire,” 193 stories from individual countries show how climate change is reshaping reality everywhere, from dying coral reefs in Fiji to disappearing oases in Morocco and far, far beyond.
The role of our leaders: Writing at the end of 2020, Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, found reasons for optimism in the Biden presidency, a feeling perhaps borne out by the passing of major climate legislation. That doesn’t mean there haven’t been criticisms. For example, Charles Harvey and Kurt House argue that subsidies for climate capture technology will ultimately be a waste.
The worst climate risks, mapped: In this feature, select a country, and we'll break down the climate hazards it faces. In the case of America, our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths.
What people can do: Justin Gillis and Hal Harvey describe the types of local activism that might be needed, while Saul Griffith points to how Australia shows the way on rooftop solar. Meanwhile, small changes at the office might be one good way to cut significant emissions, writes Carlos Gamarra.
“These are probably among the least studied coastal wetlands,” Andrew Baldwin, a University of Maryland ecologist who is studying whether they can be kept intact, told me. “Laying out the boardwalk, I was crawling through the mud. It was brutal. But it was also great, being somewhere where no one has been in a long time.”

These swamps may not invite humans in, but they are examples of intact, fully functioning ecosystems in one of the most densely populated and developed regions of the United States. These forests store carbon in the wood and in the soils that accumulated as sea level rose over centuries. They filter and scrub the water, providing one of the last natural protections for the beleaguered Chesapeake, which is undergoing an incredibly expensive, decades-long cleanup.

Not only do these places lock away carbon, slowing climate change; they also protect the surrounding coastal area by absorbing the brunt of the ever more powerful storms that our warming planet is tossing at us.
Now with the arrival of the invasive ash borer, some of these wetland forests are starting to undergo profound transformations. As trees die and decompose, their stored carbon will be released to the atmosphere, and their roots may no longer hold on to soil.
People who own land along tidal rivers face mass tree death and could even lose some of their land to rising water. In one of Maryland’s popular reserves, Pocomoke River State Park, home to perhaps the largest expanse of green and pumpkin ash in this part of the world, the forest could be hollowed out.

At a time when high-level climate and biodiversity conferences are front-page news and the plights of the rainforests of the Amazon basin and the Tongass of Southeast Alaska are well known, it’s been distressing to see these wetland forests — the Mid-Atlantic’s own version of those faraway expanses — fall apart with little public recognition.
Image

A local photographer, Leslie Brice, and I have for the past two years documented the work of a small group of scientists who are planting other tree species to test whether they can replace the dying ashes and whether chemical treatments or selected species of wasps imported from Asia can bring ash borer populations under control. These efforts can be near heroic, requiring scientists and others with the state of Maryland, University of Maryland and the Nature Conservancy to wade through thigh-deep muck in sometimes terrible weather to plant and treat trees and take measurements.
But at present, they are just Band-Aids that can at most save a few small areas. To really protect these forests would require a much larger program of tree treatments and biological controls, probably combined with long-term restoration solutions such as the breeding of a regionally adapted ash tree with genetic resistance to the borer. Because many of these wetlands are on private land, experts must also help landowners adapt. Certainly, not every tree can be saved. But perhaps enough can be protected so that the wetlands remain forested and the ecosystem survives.

2022-02-22,"A few more gems from 2021 make their way to the front of this month’s out-of-the-box streaming recommendations, along with a pair of charmingly personal documentary portraits and an explosive telling of a pressing and timely historical story.
‘Ride the Eagle’ (2021)
Stream it on Hulu.
The shaggy-dog charms of Jake Johnson receive a prime showcase in this warm and winning indie comedy-drama — and that shouldn’t come as a surprise, since Johnson co-wrote the script with the director Trent O’Donnell. Johnson stars as Leif, a 30-something slacker whose mother (Susan Sarandon) abandoned him at age 12 to join a cult. She dies, leaving him her cabin near Yosemite as part of a “conditional inheritance,” for which he must complete a list of tasks intended to put him on the right path. The modest but rewarding screenplay plays to each actor’s strengths, taking advantage of the kooky energy of Sarandon, the sharp comic timing of D’Arcy Carden (as Leif’s ex-girlfriend) and the cantankerous warmth of J.K. Simmons (as mom’s ex-boyfriend). Lessons are learned, inevitably, but O’Donnell manages to muster up earnestness and sincerity without losing any edge or humor.

‘The Map of Tiny Perfect Things’ (2021)
Stream it on Amazon.
This Y.A.-tinged “time bounce” comedy-drama name-checks its most noted narrative ancestor, “Groundhog Day,” fairly early on, but it has more in common with “Palm Springs,” another film that merged the gimmick of the time loop with the conventions of the boy-meets-girl rom-com. In this case, the high schooler Mark (Kyle Allen) discovers that his classmate Margaret (Kathryn Newton) is also stuck repeating the same day over and over, so they join up to break the pattern or, at the very least, have a good time together while trying. Newton and Allen generate considerable chemistry, while Lev Grossman’s screenplay thoughtfully dips into the complicated philosophical questions that make these stories so irresistible.
‘Bergman Island’ (2021)
Stream it on Hulu.
“I don’t like it when artists I love don’t behave so well in real life.” So notes Chris (Vicky Krieps), a filmmaker, married to another one (Tim Roth); they’re taking a working vacation on the island of Faro, where their shared hero Ingmar Bergman both lived and made his films. It’s a conundrum of interest to the writer and director Mia Hansen-Love, who uses Chris’s journey to ask perpetually pointed questions about separating art from artists. But Hansen-Love’s film is also romantic and playful, particularly in its second half, when we get a glimpse at the deeply personal screenplay Chris is drafting while on the trip. Krieps and Roth have exactly the right handle on their characters and their prickly dynamic, as the two of them love, stimulate and annoy each other, all at once.

‘In the Same Breath’ (2021)
Stream it on HBO Max.
We’re so emotionally and psychologically done with the Covid-19 pandemic that it’s tempting to wave off art that deals with it in a meaningful way. But this gripping documentary from the director Nanfu Wang reminds us of the horrifying tactical and political errors of the pandemic’s earliest days and all but begs us to learn from them. Working from Wuhan, the initial flash point of the outbreak, Wang gathers surveillance videos, secret recordings inside hospitals, news clips and official government footage to ticktock not only the spread of the virus, but the spread of misinformation around it. Exhaustingly powerful and frequently harrowing, it’s a nonfiction film that’s pitched and paced like a white-knuckle thriller.
’137 Shots’ (2021)
Stream it on Netflix.
In Cleveland in November 2012, a 60-plus police car chase ended with 13 officers firing 137 rounds to kill Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, who were unarmed. Michael Milano’s riveting documentary investigates not only the night in question (via powerfully intercut testimony, dashcam videos and expert witnesses) but the department’s attempt to cover up their mistakes as part of the city’s powder-keg history of racial inequality and the pattern of “unreasonable and unnecessary use of force” by its police. Milano keeps peeling back layers of bias and corruption before folding in the near-concurrent murder of Tamir Rice, ultimately amounting to much more than the story he sets out to tell; it becomes less a true-crime documentary than an in-depth exploration of the psychic divide that has split this country in two.
‘Detroit’ (2017)
Stream it on Amazon.

In one of the most notorious (documented) occurrences of police brutality of the 1960s, known as the Algiers Motel incident, a riot task force, which included Detroit and Michigan-state policemen and National Guardsmen, interrogated, tortured and murdered several Black men during Detroit’s 1967 12th Street Riot. Kathryn Bigelow’s dramatization — penned by her “Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty” collaborator Mark Boal — is a difficult film to watch, detailing the horrifying tactics of those officers in wrenching detail. But it’s rare to see a major Hollywood production (much less one from a white filmmaker) willing to address these issues with such unblinking clarity.
‘The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman’s Portrait Photography’ (2017)
Stream it on Netflix.
Errol Morris’s documentaries tend to delve into serious matters like crime (“The Thin Blue Line”), politics (“The Fog of War”) and their intersections (“Standard Operating Procedure”). But he has a lighter side, best glimpsed in this short, modest and lovely bio-doc of his friend and neighbor, the photographer Elsa Dorfman. Her medium is an unusual one — large-scale, oversize portraits — but her camera catches details that a standard photograph doesn’t. And Morris draws a clear line from her work to his, which has always focused on the tiny details that tell a larger story.
‘Presenting Princess Shaw’ (2015)

Samantha Montgomery works as a nurse by day, grinding out an unglamorous living for meager pay. But at night she becomes a superstar — an a cappella vocalist whose YouTube videos are overwhelming in their emotion. Ido Haar’s documentary is, on its surface, the story of how this miraculous but unknown talent is discovered by Ophir Kutiel, a.k.a. Kutiman, a composer and producer who gives her a deserved spotlight. But underneath, it’s a film about the undying artistic spirit and how so many gifted dreamers are just one click from the chance to shine."
2022-02-23,"As Kanye West thundered through “Black Skinhead” at the Los Angeles Coliseum in December as part of a benefit concert, young fans in the front row threw their bodies around in wild abandon. Others pumped their fists in the air and shouted along to the lyrics: “Pardon, I’m getting my scream on!”
Except these fans were nowhere near the Coliseum. They were inside a suburban movie theater. IMAX, the large-format cinema company, had teamed up with Mr. West to expand the concert’s live footprint by beaming his performance in real time to 35 IMAX theaters, adding more than 10,000 seats. Although the first-of-its-kind event was also available to stream live on Amazon Prime Video, IMAX sold out its shows.
“It’s hard to beat a six-story Kanye standing in front of you,” Richard L. Gelfond, IMAX’s chief executive, said in a phone interview.
Mr. Gelfond needs a lot of ticket buyers to agree with him — and not just for events involving Mr. West, who did another live collaboration with IMAX on Tuesday night, this time in 60 theaters, with a near-sellout crowd of almost 18,000 and tickets costing $20 to $30. In the coming months, IMAX intends to expand its menu to include stand-up comedy and e-sports tournaments. A company spokesman said negotiations were underway with several pop stars for concerts. H.E.R., the R&B sensation, has already agreed to collaborate with IMAX on a project. (One challenge: artist punctuality. Mr. West started his Tuesday performance more than two hours late.)

Other events will revolve around exclusive film screenings, with stars and filmmakers participating in live question-and-answer sessions. Frances McDormand and the director Joel Coen did one tied to “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” a film that was primarily distributed on Apple TV+. Peter Jackson fielded questions after an IMAX-only release of his Disney+ documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back.” Both streaming services were looking for ways to “eventize” the content — to focus attention on “Macbeth” and “Get Back” so they didn’t get lost in the torrent of streaming-service offerings.

In December, Gwen Stefani hosted an IMAX fan event live from her house, where she screened her favorite holiday film (“Elf,” which had never been shown in the IMAX format) and promoted her Christmas album. Steven Spielberg and members of his “West Side Story” cast also participated in an IMAX event.
“If you don’t keep reinventing yourself, you’re not going to move your business forward,” Mr. Gelfond said. “So we’ve been working for the last few years on events, what we informally call IMAX 3.0. The world is changing, and the movie industry is changing.”

Mr. Gelfond was referring to the ascendance of streaming services and the decline of traditional moviegoing. Both trends have been percolating for years, but they intensified during the pandemic, when many theaters were closed. Studios are now diverting most of their dramas, musicals, comedies and modestly budgeted action movies to affiliated streaming services. Leviathan fantasy franchises and sequels will continue to flow to theaters. But how will theater operators fill the gaps in their schedules?
Megan Colligan, the president of IMAX Entertainment, noted that live events “often bring in audiences that haven’t been to an IMAX theater and, in many cases, have not been to a movie theater at all in a very long time, sometimes ever.”
Ms. Colligan emphasized that IMAX events were not just about throwing content onto a really big screen, but would specifically make use of the company’s premium-format technology. Mr. West and his team, for instance, used 16 extra-high-resolution IMAX cameras to capture the December benefit performance (out of 20 cameras in total).
“There was a lot of smoke and mist, and making sure we were capturing that correctly was something that was really important to them,” Ms. Colligan said. She added that the Oscar-nominated cinematographer Larry Sher was the project’s director of photography.
The IMAX theater network has 1,700 locations in 85 countries. About 70 locations have been upgraded with instant-simulcast technology, which equates to about 25,000 seats, roughly the capacity of Madison Square Garden. “Our goal over the next year will be to connect our theaters globally,” Ms. Colligan said.

With its strength among younger consumers, known as fanboys, and focus on visual spectacles like “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” IMAX has a healthier core business than many cinema companies. Steven Cahall, a media analyst at Wells Fargo, recently named IMAX his favorite mid-cap growth stock for 2022, saying in a research report that the company “is the best way to play premium theater experiences + studios’ renewed focus on theatrical tent poles.”
On Wednesday, IMAX reported its strongest quarterly results since 2019. For the three months that ended on Dec. 31, revenue totaled $108.6 million, a 94 percent increase from a year earlier. The company also reported a net income of $10.1 million, compared with a loss of $21.2 million a year earlier. For the full year, IMAX captured about 3 percent of the worldwide box office, the company’s highest share ever.
Upcoming films shot with IMAX cameras include “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and Jordan Peele’s “Nope.”
But IMAX has long wanted to diversify beyond large-format movie capturing and projection technology, in part because “exhibition,” as the traditional movie theater business is known, is not an appealing business for most investors. (Total annual ticket sales in North America have been slowly declining for two decades.) “We are not an exhibitor,” Mr. Gelfond said bluntly in the company’s earnings news release.
The company’s diversification track record is mixed. A recent effort to tap into the streaming business has been going well; in November, IMAX teamed up with Disney+ to enhance most Marvel movies, and Mr. Gelfond said talks were underway with other streaming services for similar partnerships. In contrast, a 2016 attempt to build virtual-reality-based entertainment centers (envision the arcades of yore, except with V.R. goggles) was unsuccessful.

Mr. Gelfond, however, was able to reposition IMAX once before. The company, which he and a partner bought in 1994, started out as a museum curiosity — a maker of high-end nature and science documentaries. (Mr. Gelfond sums up this era of the company as “whales, bears and seals.”) IMAX 2.0 involved changing the brand’s focus to blockbuster movies like Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy.
“And now,” Mr. Gelfond said, “it’s time for another pivot.”"
2022-02-24,"MERRICKVILLE, Ontario — There aren’t many scientists raised in the ways of druids by Celtic medicine women, but there is at least one. She lives in the woods of Canada, in a forest she helped grow. From there, wielding just a pencil, she has been working to save some of the oldest life-forms on Earth by bewitching its humans.
At a hale 77, Diana Beresford-Kroeger is a medical biochemist, botanist, organic chemist, poet, author and developer of artificial blood. But her main focus for decades now has been to telegraph to the world, in prose that is scientifically exacting yet startlingly affecting, the wondrous capabilities of trees.
Dr. Beresford-Kroeger’s goal is to combat the climate crisis by fighting for what’s left of the great forests (she says the vast boreal wilderness that stretches across the Northern Hemisphere is as vital as the Amazon) and rebuilding what’s already come down. Trees store carbon dioxide and oxygenate the air, making them “the best and only thing we have right now to fight climate change and do it fast,” she said.
Her admirers, who included the late biodiversity pioneer E.O. Wilson, say what sets Dr. Beresford-Kreoger apart is the breadth of her knowledge. She can talk about the medicinal value of trees in one breath and their connection to human souls in the next. She moved Jane Fonda to tears. She inspired Richard Powers to base a central character of his Pulitzer-prize winning novel, “The Overstory,” in part on her: He has called her a “maverick” and her work “the best kind of animism.”

Dr. Beresford-Kroeger has also cultivated an arboreal Noah’s Ark of rare and hardy specimens that can best withstand a warming planet. The native trees she planted on her property in this rural village sequester more carbon and better resist drought, storms and temperature swings, she said, and also produce high quality, protein-rich nuts. If industrial logging continues to eat away at forests worldwide, soil fertility will plummet, and Dr. Beresford-Kroeger, an Irishwoman, is haunted by the prospect of famine.

Rent or Buy on most major platforms.
The Brazilian federal agent Miguel Montessant (Kiko Pissolato) has just arrested a corrupt governor, Sandro Corrêa (Eduardo Moscovis), on charges of embezzling public funds from hospitals. But Montessant knows that regardless of the mountain of evidence facing Corrêa, he will go free, aided by a corrupt government. Worst yet, an errant bullet strikes Montessant’s young daughter while she is on the way to a Brazilian soccer match. Although the slug injures her, what kills her is the inadequate care provided by an underfunded hospital. Now the once straightedge agent wants revenge.
Based on the Brazilian graphic novel “O Doutrinador,” the directors Gustavo Bonafé and Fábio Mendonça’s vigilante superhero film features bloody and brutal murders set to a raucous punk score. During a protest, Montessant dons a gas mask with red-lighted vision and beats the governor with his bare hands to a bloody pulp. He later teams with a hacker (Tainá Medina) to hunt down the other dishonorable governmental string pullers. The glut of American superhero films can obscure the richness of the genre, especially its potential for political statements. But “The Awakener,” even in its depravity, refreshingly restores that power of meaning.
‘Pushpa: The Rise’
Stream it on Amazon.
In the director Sukumar’s epic action flick, a low-wage laborer named Pushpa (Allu Arjun) is forced to illegally harvest a rare wood that only grows in the Seshachalam Hills of southeastern India. Despite his unkempt appearance, Pushpa is the prototypical action hero: stoic, egotistic and defiant of authority figures, particularly the local capitalistic businessmen and corrupt cops. He’s the kind of Joe cool, who, when offered water after a merciless beating, extends the refreshment to his huffing torturer.

“Pushpa: The Rise” is an origin story. The single-named hero advances through the ranks of the smuggling operation, wrestling power from a ruthless dealer along the way.

Pushpa’s escape from underworld thugs is so hilariously outlandish (he careens through a jungle blindfolded), I immediately wanted the sequel.
‘Seobok: Project Clone’
Rent or Buy on most major platforms.
On its face, the story of a genetically engineered being created to foster immortality in humans would seem primarily like science fiction. But the film has more up its sleeve. The dehumanizing scientists call this creature the Specimen, yet his real name is Seobok (Park Bo-Gum), a clone made from stem cells, impenetrable to disease. With his higher brain function he can even manipulate matter. The latter ability puts him in the terrain of mutants, making the South Korean director Lee Yong-ju’s film another crisp, adventurous reimagining of the superhero subgenre.
The American and South Korean governments would rather this clone did not exist. They believe an immortal world, filled with ambivalent humans, could lead to extinction. Chief Ahn (Woo-jin Jo), the head of an intelligence agency, brings on the former operative Ki Heon (Gong Yoo) to help transfer Seobok to a safer location.
Massive, Christopher Nolan-style set pieces fill Lee’s film (Ki Heon drives a semi-truck through a brick wall). Unlike other blustery superhero flicks, however, an existential dread consumes this movie: “If dying is like sleep, then why aren’t we afraid to sleep?” asks Seobok. These kinds of poetic reflections set the poignant “Seobok: Project Clone” apart from other, slighter action flicks.

‘Looop Lapeta’
Stream it on Netflix.
An Indian adaptation of Tom Tykwer’s “Run Lola Run,” the director Aakash Bhatia’s “Looop Lapeta” features a similar visual playfulness, gleefully experimenting with smart, dynamic compositions, while managing to add new, plentiful layers. After the former sprinter Savi (Taapsee Pannu) attempts suicide, she falls in love with the gambling grifter Satya (Tahir Raj Bhasin), a man with a smile for every occasion. They live a devil-may-care, albeit penniless life, often upended by Satya’s misguided get-rich-quick schemes.
When Satya loses $5 million of his underworld boss’s money on a bus, however, they discover a trouble that may be too big, even for them.
Much like Lola in the original, Savi, in trying to save Satya, becomes stuck in a time loop while learning to be a kinder person to the people around her. Fascinatingly, Bhatia maps the ancient myth of Savitri’s deception of Yama (the god of death) onto Tykwer’s Eurocentric concept, adding a uniquely Indian resonance to the action. Mixed with sharp comedy, screwball characters and idiosyncratic split screens, “Looop Lapeta” is a fun yet introspective entanglement of romance and action.

‘The Translator’
Rent or Buy on most major platforms.
Sami Najjar (Ziad Bakri) was once a well-respected translator. But following a gaffe at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, when he mistranslated the words of his childhood friend, a Syrian boxer, he was banished from his homeland to Australia. Now, a decade later during the Arab Spring in Syria, with his activist brother Zaid kidnapped by pro-regime forces, Sami returns to find him.
The directors Rana Kazkaz and Anas Khalaf’s film, a subdued political action-thriller doubling as a character study, hinges on Bakri’s gripping performance. Sami comes back to a frightening world of random death: Snipers patrol buildings, killing squads hunt indiscriminately and the unrelenting governmental surveillance makes every move made by Sami a dangerous cat-and-mouse game. A twitchy camera, as startled as the viewer, translates Bakri’s frenetic body and his arched anguish.
Family drama ensues too: Sami’s sister Karma (Yumna Marwan) despises how Sami has hidden in Australia rather than fight, making this film about the pain of being left behind and abandoned both by family and the greater world. That potent mix of hurt and anxiety makes “The Translator” wholly unshakable."
2022-02-26,"Big tech companies like Meta and Google were among the first to announce during the pandemic that they would allow some employees to work from home permanently, but they have also been spending billions of dollars expanding their office spaces.
Doubling down on offices may seem counterintuitive to the many tech workers who continue to work remotely. In January, 48 percent of people in computer and math fields and 35 percent of those in architecture or engineering said they had worked from home at some point because of the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But companies, real-estate analysts and workplace experts said that several factors were propelling the trend, including a hiring boom, a race to attract and retain top talent and a sense that offices will play a key role in the future of work.
Debates over whether workers should be required to return to the office can be thorny because some employees say they have been happier and more productive at home. One way companies are trying to lure them back is by splurging on prime office space with great amenities.

Big Tech executives say that office expansions are to be expected and that modernized buildings will probably be spaces for people to collaborate rather than stare at screens. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, leased 730,000 square feet in Midtown Manhattan in August 2020, and has added space in Silicon Valley as well as in Austin, Texas; Boston; Chicago; and Bellevue, Wash.
Google said early last year that it would spend $7 billion on new and expanded offices and data centers around the country in 2021, including $2.1 billion to buy a Manhattan office building by the Hudson River, and growth in Atlanta; Silicon Valley; Boulder, Colo.; Durham, N.C.; and Pittsburgh. Google also said in January that it would spend $1 billion on a London office building."

Putin ratchets up tensions on Ukraine
Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, further intensified the crisis in Ukraine by placing his nuclear forces on alert, threatening the West as it rallied behind Ukraine. President Biden chose to de-escalate by refusing to change America’s own alert status, portraying Putin as once again manufacturing a menace. Follow the latest updates.
The U.N. Security Council responded by voting to convene a rare special session of the General Assembly — only the 11th time it has done so since 1950. Eleven of the Security Council’s 15 members voted in favor of the resolution. China, India and the U.A.E. abstained, as they had for a resolution last week condemning the invasion.
Despite Putin’s announcement, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, agreed to talks with Putin at the border with Belarus “without preconditions.” The talks are scheduled to begin today.
Fighting: The violence continued yesterday, with the Russians “shelling in almost all directions,” according to a Ukrainian military official. Residents of Ukraine’s country towns have joined the fight. More than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed since the invasion began, according to Ukrainian officials. Satellite imagery showed a miles-long convoy of hundreds of Russian military vehicles closing in on Kyiv.

Thomas Peter/Reuters
Data points to Wuhan market as the pandemic’s origin
Two new studies point to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, as the birthplace of the coronavirus pandemic. Scientists concluded that the virus was very likely present in live mammals sold in the market, an object of early suspicion, in late 2019.
The studies, which have not yet been published in a scientific journal, suggest that the virus twice spilled over into people working or shopping there, and it found no support for the so-called lab leak theory.
But some outside scientists said they remained unconvinced by the studies’ findings. There is no direct evidence that animals at the market were infected with the coronavirus, and no wildlife was left there by the time Chinese researchers collected genetic samples in early 2020.

Details: Data on Covid cases from the social media app Weibo from December 2019 through February 2020 pointed to the market as the origin of the outbreak, with the virus then spreading to surrounding neighborhoods. The researchers ran tests that showed it was extremely unlikely that the pattern could be produced by chance.
Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.

The war in Ukraine is straining North African economies already weakened by the pandemic.
After an outcry, Hong Kong said it would allow infected children to remain with their families instead of being separated from them.
More than five million children worldwide lost a caregiver to Covid-19 in the first 19 months of the pandemic, a study estimates.

The biggest climate change case in a decade
The Supreme Court will hear arguments today in a dispute that could restrict or even eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to control the pollution that is heating the planet, potentially shredding President Biden’s plans to halve greenhouse emissions in the U.S. by the end of the decade.
The outcome could also have repercussions that stretch well beyond air pollution, restricting the ability of federal agencies to regulate health care, workplace safety, telecommunications, the financial sector and more.
At issue is a lack of a federal regulation that governs emissions from power plants, after the Supreme Court put Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, his chief strategy to fight climate change, on hold. The Biden administration has yet to issue its own legislation. It is highly unusual for the court to take up a case that revolves around a hypothetical future regulation, legal experts said.

Analysis: “They could handcuff the federal government’s ability to affordably reduce greenhouse gases from power plants,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton. The power sector is the country’s second-largest source of carbon emissions.

The life-affirming comforts of ‘death cleaning’
Cleaning out a home can be a morbid, depressing task, often best left until after you’re gone, when it’s no longer your problem. But what if you decide to tackle the chore now, while you’re still here to make the decisions?
As we begin to emerge from a long and deadly pandemic, some older Americans have decided to do just that, Ronda Kaysen reports for The Times. Professional home organizers are seeing an increase in calls from older clients who want to cut through the clutter and make their lives more livable.
Professionals often refer to the task as “death cleaning,” a term popularized in 2018 with the publication of the book “The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning,” by Margareta Magnusson. It posits that the prospect of our eventual demise is reason enough to purge.
Magnusson suggests we choose not to burden our loved ones with a lifetime of personal effects, including letters or journals that may offend or upset. “I don’t think that’s nice to leave that to your own children,” she said in an interview. Simply put, we should be preparing for the end throughout our lives, pruning as we go.

2022-02-28,"“Would you like to sign in with your palm?”
That was the question a cheerful Amazon employee posed when greeting me last week at the opening of a Whole Foods Market in Washington’s Glover Park neighborhood. She blithely added, “You can also begin shopping by scanning the QR code in your Amazon app.”
“Let’s go for the palm,” I said.
In less than a minute, I scanned both hands on a kiosk and linked them to my Amazon account. Then I hovered my right palm over the turnstile reader to enter the nation’s most technologically sophisticated grocery store.
For the next 30 minutes, I shopped. I picked up a bag of cauliflower florets, grapefruit sparkling water, a carton of strawberries and a package of organic chicken sausages. Cameras and sensors recorded each of my moves, creating a virtual shopping cart for me in real time. Then I simply walked out, no cashier necessary. Whole Foods — or rather Amazon — would bill my account later.
More than four years ago, Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13 billion. Now the Amazon-ification of the grocery chain is physically complete, as showcased by the revamped Whole Foods store in Glover Park.

For a long time, Amazon made only small steps toward putting its mark on the more than 500 Whole Foods stores in the United States and Britain. The main evidence of change were the discounts and free home delivery for Amazon Prime members.
But this 21,000-square-foot Whole Foods just north of Georgetown has catapulted Amazon’s involvement forward. Along with another prototype Whole Foods store, which will open in Los Angeles this year, Amazon designed my local grocer to be almost completely run by tracking and robotic tools for the first time.
The technology, known as Just Walk Out, consists of hundreds of cameras with a god’s-eye view of customers. Sensors are placed under each apple, carton of oatmeal and boule of multigrain bread. Behind the scenes, deep-learning software analyzes the shopping activity to detect patterns and increase the accuracy of its charges.
The technology is comparable to what’s in driverless cars. It identifies when we lift a product from a shelf, freezer or produce bin; automatically itemizes the goods; and charges us when we leave the store. Anyone with an Amazon account, not just Prime members, can shop this way and skip a cash register since the bill shows up in our Amazon account.

Amazon has tested such automation for more than four years, starting with 24 Amazon Go convenience stores and several Amazon Fresh grocery stores around the country. The palm-scanning technology, known as Amazon One, is also being licensed by others, such as a Hudson convenience store at Dallas Love Field Airport and Shaquille O’Neal’s Big Chicken restaurant at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle.

Those stores were valuable experiments, said Dilip Kumar, Amazon’s vice president of physical retail and technology. The company is treating Whole Foods as another step in its tech expansion into retail stores, he said.
“We observed areas that caused friction for customers, and we diligently worked backward to figure out ways to alleviate that friction,” Mr. Kumar said. “We’ve always noticed that customers didn’t like standing in checkout lines. It’s not the most productive use of their time, which is how we came up with the idea to build Just Walk Out.”
He declined to comment on whether Amazon planned to expand the technology to all Whole Foods stores.
My New York Times colleague Karen Weise, who covers Amazon from Seattle, said the company operated on long time horizons, with the patience and money to execute slowly. That has allowed it to transform labor, retail and logistics over many years, she said. Groceries are just one piece of its ambitions.

The Whole Foods in Glover Park has operated for more than 20 years, a cornerstone of a neighborhood that is within walking distance of Embassy Row and the vice president’s Naval Observatory residence. Four years ago, the store closed over a dispute with the landlord and a rat infestation. Amazon announced last year that it would reopen the store as a Just Walk Out pilot project.
The rats may be gone, but not the neighborhood angst. The renovated store has sparked a spirited local debate, with residents sparring on the Nextdoor community app and a neighborhood email list over the store’s “dystopian” feeling versus its “impressive technology.” Some neighbors reminisced about how the store used to invite people to just hang out, with free samples and fluffy blueberry pancakes sold on weekends.

Alex Levin, 55, an 18-year resident of Glover Park, said people should not reject the store’s changes.
“We need to understand the benefits and downsides of the technology and use it to our advantage,” he said. He added that he had tried tricking the cameras and sensors by placing a box of chicken nuggets in his shopping bag and then putting the item back in a freezer. Amazon wasn’t fooled, and he wasn’t charged for the nuggets, he said.

But others said they had found errors in their bills and complained about the end of produce by the pound. Everything is now offered per item, bundle or box. Some mourned the disappearance of the checkout line, where they perused magazines and last-minute grab bag items. Many were suspicious of the tracking tech.
“It’s like George Orwell’s ‘1984,’” said Allen Hengst, 72, a retired librarian.
Amazon said it didn’t plan to use video and other Whole Foods customer information for advertising or its recommendation engine. Shoppers who don’t want to participate in the experimental technology can enter the store without signing in and pay at self-checkout kiosks with a credit card or cash.
As a longtime customer of Glover Park’s Whole Foods, I had missed the dark, cramped and often chaotic store and was excited to explore the changes. But somewhere between the palm scan and the six-pack banana bundles, I began to feel ambivalent.
I noticed a sign near the entrance that forbade shoppers to take photos or videos inside. My eyes drifted toward the ceiling, where I noticed hundreds of small black plastic boxes hanging from the rafters.
An employee jumped in. “Those are the cameras that will follow you during your shopping experience,” she explained, with no hint of irony.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Several workers milled about the entrance to guide customers through check-in, while others stood behind the seafood counter, cheese station and produce areas. Mr. Kumar said the stores would always employ humans, but I wondered for how much longer. Amazon, under scrutiny for its labor practices, said employees’ roles might shift over time and become more focused on interacting with customers to answer questions.
There were early signs of a more self-service future. At the bakery, I looked for someone to slice my $4.99 Harvest loaf and was directed to an industry-grade bread slicer for customers. A small label warned: Sharp blades. Keep hands clear of all moving parts.
Mr. Kumar wouldn’t share data on the accuracy of Just Walk Out, so I tested the technology. I picked up an organic avocado and placed it on a pile of nonorganic avocados. After walking around the store, I went back and picked up the same organic avocado. If the cameras and sensors functioned properly, Amazon would be on top of my actions and charge me for the organic avocado that had been misplaced in the conventional bin.
When I was ready to leave, I had the option of using a self-checkout kiosk or skipping the process. I decided on the latter and waved my palm again over an exit turnstile. The turnstile’s arms opened.
“You should receive your receipt within two to three hours,” an employee at the exit said.
I walked out. It felt discomfiting, like I might be mistaken for a shoplifter.

An email from Amazon landed in my inbox an hour later. A link sent me to my Amazon account for details. It said my shopping experience had lasted 32 minutes 26 seconds. My total bill was $34.35 — and I was correctly charged for the organic avocado."

‘Drive My Car’
Starts streaming: March 2
Nominated for four Academy Awards this year, including best picture, this critically acclaimed drama is a captivating meditation on loss and regret. Directed and co-written by Ryusuke Hamaguchi (adapting a Haruki Murakami short story), “Drive My Car” has Hidetoshi Nishijima playing Yusuke Kafuku, a renowned actor and theater director who is mourning the death of his wife and muse. When he agrees to direct a multilingual stage adaptation of “Uncle Vanya” in Hiroshima, Yusuke bonds with his designated driver, while also forging a wary relationship with the play’s star — who was his late wife’s secret lover. Though the movie has a three-hour running time, Hamaguchi moves the plot fairly briskly from one quietly intense scene to another, bringing a beautiful blue tinge to the story of a man haunted by all things he has left unsaid and undone.
‘Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty’
Starts streaming: March 6
The sports reporter Jeff Pearlman’s book “Showtime” covered the rise of the 1980s Los Angeles Lakers, an exciting and star-laden team who helped the N.B.A. become an international phenomenon. The TV adaptation “Winning Time” turns that tale into a stylish period dramedy and features an all-star cast recreating an era when a handful of strong, often conflicting personalities changed the whole culture of professional basketball. The producer Adam McKay (who also directed the first episode) and creators Max Borenstein and Jim Hecht deploy a storytelling style reminiscent of McKay’s movie “The Big Short,” where characters like Jerry Buss (John C. Reilly), Jerry West (Jason Clarke), Magic Johnson (Quincy Isaiah) and Pat Riley (Adrien Brody) sometimes break the fourth wall to help explain the fine details of business management, on-court strategy and handling superstar egos.
‘Minx’ Season 1
Starts streaming: March 17
Set amid the freewheeling publishing industry in early 1970s Los Angeles, “Minx” stars Ophelia Lovibond as Joyce, an activist who gets the chance to create and edit the feminist magazine of her dreams — so long as she is willing to include erotic photo spreads of naked men. Jake Johnson plays Doug, a successful pornographer who mentors Joyce, a proudly independent woman embarrassed to admit the troubles she has had adjusting to the age of sexual liberation. Created by Ellen Rapoport, “Minx” finds humor in the ways that certain gender-role expectations and stereotypes persist even in an “anything goes” era of free love and progressive politics.

In her new memoir, Amy Bloom writes about helping her husband to end his life after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s."
2022-03-03,"Brandon Sanderson, a prolific sci-fi and fantasy author, started an online fund-raising campaign this week to self-publish four of the novels he wrote during the pandemic. His goal: to raise $1 million in 30 days.
He blew past the first million in about 35 minutes. And the ticker kept rising.
In 24 hours, he raised $15.4 million, which the fund-raising website Kickstarter said was the single most successful day of any of their campaigns. By Thursday, two days into it, he had raised more than $19 million.
The eye-popping sum raises questions about what is possible for authors with major platforms who are willing to self-publish — and why the vast majority of big names stick with traditional routes to publication. But analysts, and even Sanderson himself, don’t see this kind of self-publishing as a problem for the industry or a desirable choice for most writers. Rather, for the right author, the two paths can coexist and help expand options for readers.
“Publishers need authors to be entrepreneurs these days,” said Kristen McLean, the executive director of business development at NPD Books, which tracks book sales. “This is just going to build his profile and continue to drive the backlist sales of all of his books.”
Part of why this project has worked for Sanderson, McLean said, is his unique relationship with his fans. He has sold 20 million print, audio and e-books, Sanderson said, including titles such as “Rhythm of War,” an epic fantasy novel about a coalition of humans resisting an enemy invasion. Like many authors of science fiction and fantasy, he has spent a lot of time in conventions and interacting with his audience. In 2019, he said, he was on the road for 111 days.
But self-publishing on the scale Sanderson is proposing is an enormously complicated proposition. Fundamentally, most authors want to write books, not run a publishing house.

Good morning. How far do supply chain issues reach? Today we’ll look at an unlikely niche of the New York economy that is coping with them. We’ll also hear from a big band that’s swinging again.

Supply chain issues are affecting headstone makers.
Yes, supply chain issues, three words that have become a catchphrase and an excuse. And yes, headstone makers.
Supply chain issues have affected everything from automobile companies (when shortages of chips force manufacturing slowdowns) to the Partybus Bakeshop on the Lower East Side (where Jacqueline Eng, the head baker and co-owner, had trouble finding Callebaut 54-percent cacao callets for cookies).
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The words “supply chain issues” have appeared 178 times in The New York Times in the last year. Many of those mentions had to do with high-tech products. But the most recent showed that those issues have crimped old-fashioned businesses with time-honored manufacturing methods. The headstone makers.
Monument memorial companies’ problems compounded the grief of people who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus and delayed the sense of closure that comes with seeing a grave marker in place. Nearly 40,000 people have died of Covid-19 in New York City since the first case was reported two years ago.
Our writer Liza Weisstuch says that demand quickly strained the memorial industry. Monument companies were not classified as essential businesses when New York State ordered a shutdown in March 2020. Their status changed after the New York State Monument Builders Association appealed to state officials, but the backlog was already piling up at Domenick DeNigris Monuments and Mausoleums in the Bronx, one of a few such companies in a city that was once a nexus for monument making.
“We probably have over 800 orders; it’s so depressing,” said Don DeNigris, a third-generation co-owner.
Then came the supply chain problems. The 3M Company announced last fall that it would stop making spools of a rubber-based adhesive stencil that can withstand the force of sandblasting, something that monument companies depend on. 3M attributed the decision to “severely constrained raw material availability, exponentially increasing costs and strategic business focus,” according to a letter to its clients.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
For the city’s monument companies, this was not good news. DeNigris and Sprung Monuments — which opened in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 1905 and moved to Long Island in the 1950s — began hunting for other sources of stencils, hoping their inventories would last until alternatives arrived.
“It’s like your last drink,” said Adam Sprung, a fourth-generation owner of Sprung Monuments. “You kind of nurse it.”
Smaller stencil makers could not sell them as many spools as they needed. Some companies imported stencil products from China, only to face unexpected shipping costs, tariffs and transportation delays.
DeNigris said all of this is hard to explain to customers who are — understandably — raw with grief.
“Our hands are tied, that’s where we are,” he said. “It has to be explained the right way. And this is not a New York City problem, it’s not a state problem. It’s a world problem.”

A big band swings again

Richard Termine for The New York Times
The coronavirus pandemic silenced Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks, a band that plays the kind of music that caught on when the Jazz Age dawned after the Spanish flu outbreak a century ago.
“A lot of my guys couldn’t pay their New York rent, so they had to split town,” Giordano told my colleague Corey Kilgannon. Worse, Giordano recalled, “You had a lot of people saying New York was dead, that it wasn’t going to come back again.”
Giordano — who plays a variety of instruments, including the tuba, the bass saxophone and the string bass, which he slaps, as jazz bassists did — kept practicing during the pandemic. So did the others in his band. But not together. And that worried Giordano.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“When a band is apart,” he said, “it takes a little time to get the old engine to turn over again.”
The engine is revving again, with its familiar visual touches. Besides Giordano’s distinctive aluminum bass, there is the violinist Andy Stein’s strange-looking “phono-fiddle.” It has a gramophone-style horn attached to amplify the sound.
There are some new Nighthawks. A few players decided not to return to New York as infections waned after the Omicron surge, forcing Giordano to hire replacements. Among them is the drummer Paul Wells, who stepped behind the band’s distinctive antique set with its hand-painted bass drum and wooden Chinese blocks. Giordano and the Nighthawks now play on Mondays and Tuesdays at Bond 45, on West 46th Street (but not this coming Monday, March 7).
Corey describes the Nighthawks’ fans as “aficionados, nostalgiacs and celebrities.” Tony Danza, Michael Feinstein, Molly Ringwald and Loudon Wainwright have done guest appearances, singing.
And Giordano said some social media influencers have also dropped by.
“They put some videos online with descriptions like ‘Gatsby’ and ‘Prohibition’ and ‘speakeasy,’” he said. “Having a 1920s band on TikTok just blew me away, but hey, whatever it takes.”

A shoveled path
Image
Dear Diary:
On a Monday morning after a snowstorm, I shoveled a path from the sidewalk to the street in front of my Brooklyn home.
The path was long, and there had not been a good way across the snow to the street before I made it.
I was expecting a delivery: an ornately carved, 1865 marble fireplace from a townhouse in the East 50s that was to be demolished. The fireplace was exquisite, and I thought I would enjoy looking at it in my plain front room.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
As I waited, I watched other people use my path to the street. It became so popular I got nervous that it would be blocked when the movers arrived.
When they did, the path was clear. There were two of them, and they unloaded the fireplace carefully in four sections and navigated the path just fine.
Following them inside, I suddenly heard myself scream: The largest and last piece of the fireplace had shattered, seeming almost to implode.
The men staggered around in a giant cloud of dust. They said they were sorry, that it wasn’t their fault — which, of course, was true.
Soon, they left, and I stood with my expensive pile of rubble. I looked at the empty wall where the beautiful old piece would have gone. I removed the big pieces of broken marble. Then the little pieces and the chunks of plaster.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Finally, I swept the dust into a paper bag. Later, I knew, I would have to mop.
All afternoon, I sat at the front window and watched my path. A woman crossed with a tiny dog. The passenger door of a taxi glided to a stop, exactly level with the opening I had created.
A man carrying a plastic bag filled with empty cans walked through sideways. And a courier towing a cart of packages left tracks that made my path ever so slightly wider.

2022-03-05,"As western social media sites tried to block misleading ads coming out of Russia this week, Rob Blackie was trying to sneak ads in.
Mr. Blackie, a British digital strategist, wanted Russians to see impartial news about the invasion in Ukraine. His solution to avoid Russia’s censors: digital ads, which he and a team of volunteers began buying with automated technology and slipping past government filters onto online platforms in Russia.
Bearing neutral headlines such as, “What is known about the situation in Ukraine at the moment,” the ads were viewed two million times as of midday Friday and directed viewers 42,000 times to independent news sources such as the BBC, Mr. Blackie said.
“The great thing about digital advertising is that it’s quite hard to stop it,” he said.
Pushback against the Russian assault has played out prominently in the form of economic sanctions, company exits and widespread moral outrage. But as President Vladimir V. Putin continues his advance into Ukraine, advertising has become another vehicle of protest: in commercials squeezed in the margins of news coverage, in subtle tweaks to brand names and marketing campaigns, in agencies leaving Russia and in attempts to counteract the misinformation splashed across online banners with more accurate messaging.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Marla Kaplowitz, the chief executive of 4A’s, an advertising trade group, said the industry has done far more to respond to Russia’s attack compared with past crises. Marketing organizations have galvanized around addressing misinformation, with a 100-person conference call on the situation on Thursday and another meeting on Friday, she said.
“We see the industry trying to figure out what to do, because people feel a bit helpless, like putting out a statement just doesn’t feel like enough right now,” she said. “The whole world is reacting in a different way, rallying around Ukraine — it’s not enough to just say something, you actually have to do something.”
Almost immediately after Russia attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24, brands began producing symbolic expressions of solidarity. E-sports teams, productivity apps, health care companies, crypto services, ad giants and other organizations changed their logos to reflect the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag.
The Ad Council, a nonprofit known for its public service campaigns featuring Smokey Bear and McGruff the Crime Dog, began running a campaign online and on billboards on Thursday directing viewers to donate to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund. The British price comparison website Compare the Market removed ads featuring its popular 13-year-old mascot, an animated meerkat portrayed as a Russian oligarch named Aleksandr Orlov.

Ads also became a front in the information war, as efforts to share verified news and solicit help clashed with Russia’s push to spread falsehoods and censor independent reports.

Twitter temporarily paused ads in Ukraine and Russia so that the ads did not distract from public safety information. Facebook’s parent company Meta said it was blocking Russian state media from advertising or monetizing on its platform. Google suspended advertising from Russian state media on YouTube; Snap halted ad sales in Russia and its ally, Belarus.
On Friday, Russia blocked Facebook inside the country, as part of the Kremlin’s broadening campaign to tighten control of the internet and limit spaces for dissent about the war in Ukraine. The move could foreshadow further restrictions against other tech companies such as Google, which owns YouTube, and Twitter. Facebook said it would pause ad targeting capabilities in Russia and prevent advertisers in the country from running ads on the platform.
Before those restrictions, one digital ad agency tried to rally advertising professionals to participate in “the most important brief ever,” with the goal of stopping a potential world war. Through its Prevent WW3 project, ISD Group solicited marketing campaigns that would raise money for Ukrainian refugees, encourage peacekeepers to protect Ukraine, inform Russians about the war and persuade companies to leave Russia.

Examples so far have included small efforts such as posters and digital ads, but also complex initiatives such as one from a creative director in San Francisco who is trying to persuade American bars and restaurants to expand their menus with Molotov cocktails — drinks accompanied by stories about the Ukrainian bartenders who submitted recipes.
The ad agency DDB Germany was working on a broader campaign about press censorship called “Truth Wins” when its client, the nonprofit group Reporters Without Borders, asked it to quickly craft a response to Russian efforts to stanch information flow about Ukraine. The agency came up with a plan to collect censored articles about the war and mint them into the blockchain via Ethereum domain links, preventing them from being blocked by the Russian government.
But Madison Avenue was also skittish in some ways. Companies faced conflicting advice to pause marketing campaigns out of respect for Ukraine, but also to speak out in support of the country. Executives were pressured to pause their advertising campaigns and instead gift their marketing budgets to humanitarian aid organizations (though warnings circulated on social media about scammers pretending to collect donations for relief efforts).
Wall-to-wall news coverage showing the smoking rubble of residential buildings and newborn infants in intensive care in a makeshift bomb shelter caused familiar fears to resurface for companies that had worried during the pandemic about how their advertising would be perceived alongside tragic news events.
Within a week of Russia’s first attack, several ads had faced criticism, including an Applebee’s ad that appeared amid a CNN broadcast about air raid sirens in Kyiv.

Kylie Jenner, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star and beauty brand executive, faced accusations of being “tone deaf” when she posted an Instagram Story offering her “thoughts and prayers” to Ukrainians and followed it two hours later with a post promoting a lip shine product.
The Aggregator Show, an event in New Jersey geared to Amazon vendors, said it fired a worker who advertised the gathering by writing in a LinkedIn post that “while Russia is taking over Ukraine, we’re taking over the Amazon event industry.” The post ended with a taunt: “Whoever can’t handle it, take shelter.”
“This is not who we are or what we are about,” the company said in a statement about the post.
Afraid of stumbling into a similar scenario, some companies have begun blocking their ads from appearing next to news coverage about the crisis in Ukraine, brand safety specialists said. The precautions echo a rush in 2020 to avoid stories featuring words such as “coronavirus” and “pandemic,” although concerns about depriving publishers of critical advertising revenue has pushed many companies to evolve their blocking strategies.
“To put things into perspective, this is a real crisis situation that’s life or death for many people,” said Jason Lee, the senior vice president of digital and data strategy for Horizon Media. “What we’re doing in the advertising and media world is very important, but we also have to be mindful of this larger conflict occurring, and so it gets back to the question: Could a brand be part of the conversation, and should they?”
While advertising clients weighed their options, the agencies and industry organizations representing them offered support to their Ukrainian counterparts and shunned Russia. Accenture, which has a large marketing business, pulled out of Russia on Thursday. Organizers of Cannes Lions, the industry conference and competition scheduled for the summer in France, said on Friday that they would not accept submissions or delegations from Russia and would offer free passes to Ukrainian participants. Etsy, the online marketplace, said it was waiving advertising charges, along with other fees, for its sellers in Ukraine.

But the two countries have a relatively small presence in the Western advertising world. Mark Read, the chief executive of the ad giant WPP, said during a conference call with investors on Feb. 24 that while Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine was “obviously a great concern to us,” the countries’ “economic impact on our business is not necessarily that great.”
On Friday, WPP discontinued its operations in Russia, where it has nearly 1,400 employees but draws less than 1 percent of its annual revenue. In a statement, it said that having an ongoing presence in a country responsible for the “horrific attack” on Ukraine “would be inconsistent with our values as a company.”"
2022-03-06,"In the art world, publications called catalogues raisonnés are authoritative records of an artist’s complete works. And now, in what is being called a first in the watch world, “MB&F: The First Fifteen Years” is to be published later this year.
“A catalogue raisonné in watchmaking is totally unique and was unheard-of” before the MB&F book, Pascal Ravessoud, director of external affairs at the industry organization Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, wrote in an email.
Maximilian Büsser, founder of MB&F, or Maximilian Büsser & Friends, supported the idea: “For years people have been telling the story of MB&F, of our ups and downs and the exhilarating moments and the terrifying moments. People would say ‘you should write a book.’”

The volume includes details about each of the brand’s calibers, reference numbers, technical specifications, the years of production and precise production totals for 160 references.
At age 55, he wasn’t ready to tell his life story just yet, “but,” he said, “there was this insane body of work that we produced. In 15 years, we created 18 calibers.” And when a customer had questions about a specific watch, Mr. Büsser said he could see the need for a comprehensive register of his company’s work.

Then William Massena — the watch specialist William Rohr who uses the surname Massena professionally — approached him with the idea of creating a catalogue raisonné and Mr. Büsser agreed to underwrite the costs, which he did not disclose.
Suzanne Wong, the watch expert and editor in chief of the online watch site WorldTempus, wrote the 30-page introduction that chronicles MB&F from its founding in 2005 until 2020. The rest of the 312 pages, compiled by Mr. Massena, details each of the brand’s calibers and includes reference numbers, technical specifications, the years of production and precise production totals for every one of its 160 references, accompanied by color photographs. It is to be published by La Martinière Groupe of France.

Book sellers, including Barnes & Noble and Amazon, expect to have copies of the book ($170 each) available for sale in October. And 1,500 copies, in special presentation boxes and priced at $220 each, are to be sold to MB&F clients and retailers in the summer. Pre-orders may be made at the watch brand’s M.A.D.Gallery eShop."

The world’s turn from Russian oil
The I.M.F. said over the weekend that the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia would have a “severe impact” on the global economy, further disrupting supply chains and stoking already high inflation. Investors have been processing the latest developments, and markets opened on Monday with sharp moves: Most notably, energy prices are soaring and stocks are sinking.
Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, briefly rose above $130 a barrel, roughly double the price a year ago. The price of European natural gas continued to soar, and is triple its level a month ago. Stocks fell in Asia and in Europe many markets have slipped into bear-market territory, down 20 percent from recent highs. Stocks in the U.S. are poised to open lower in what’s shaping up to be another tumultuous session.

Energy prices are reacting to talk of an embargo on Russian oil. Western lawmakers have begun discussing a ban, long seen as unlikely. (The Treasury Department stressed that Wall Street could still trade Russian oil and gas, after some financial firms stopped.)
With gas hitting $4 a gallon at the pump yesterday, U.S. officials said that they were concerned about disrupting fuel supplies, worries that have seemingly prompted the Biden administration to reach out to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
Shell shows how difficult a total ban would be to enforce. The oil giant confirmed that it bought some Russian crude to maintain fuel supplies to Europe, even as it said it would get out of its Russia operations. “We will further reduce our use of Russian oil as alternative crudes become available to buy,” a company spokesman told Reuters, but “in the current, tight market there is a relative lack of alternatives.”
Analysts are rethinking their stock-market forecasts. One theme that’s taking shape, strategists at Goldman Sachs note in a report, is a shift toward “pricing more risk premium in European assets.” Equity and currency markets in Europe have already blown past the bank’s pre-invasion downside scenario, while U.S. assets have only priced in about half of the forecast worst-case decline. (Relatedly, Goldman recently upped its expectations for buybacks and dividends at S&P 500 firms.) Holger Schmieding of Berenberg expects stocks to recover some of their losses in three to six months, but “for a while, markets can take on a self-sustaining dynamic of their own. Fear can beget fear.”
The latest on the Russia-Ukraine war:
Russia is complicating efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran by demanding written guarantees that it can trade with Tehran.
Is Norilsk Nickel, a huge producer of nickel and palladium, too big to face sanctions? Will Gazprom and Rosneft, the energy giants, make bond payments to foreign creditors?
Ukraine is publicly pushing China to help broker an end to the war, though analysts suggest that’s unlikely. Russian banks under Western sanctions are using China’s UnionPay system to process customer transactions.
Elon Musk said it was “extremely obvious” that Europe should rely more on nuclear energy to wean itself off Russian fuel. But he hasn’t responded to online pleas for Tesla to deactivate its cars in Russia.

2022-03-08,"WASHINGTON — President Biden on Tuesday banned imports of Russian oil, gas and coal in response to what he called President Vladimir V. Putin’s “vicious war of choice” in Ukraine, but warned Americans that the decision to inflict economic pain on Russia would inevitably mean higher gas prices at home.
“Defending freedom is going to cost,” Mr. Biden said in televised remarks announcing the ban at the White House.
The president’s move immediately shut off a relatively small flow of oil into the United States, but it was quickly followed by a British pledge to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year and a declaration from the European Commission — the executive arm of the European Union, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil and gas — to make itself independent of that supply in the coming years.
The impact of the decisions quickly rippled across the global energy market amid fears that the supply of oil would shrink. In the United States, the national average price of a gallon of regular gasoline, which had already surged in recent weeks, reached $4.173, not adjusted for inflation, a new high and an average increase of about 72 cents from only a month ago, according to AAA.
“If we do not respond to Putin’s assault on global peace and stability today, the cost of freedom and to the American people will be even greater tomorrow,” Mr. Biden said.
He vowed to “do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.”
Under intense, bipartisan pressure from lawmakers to deny Russia any more oil revenue from Americans, Mr. Biden acted without the unity among allies that has characterized most of the response to Russia’s aggression during the past several months.

2022-03-09,"A House committee asked the Justice Department on Wednesday to investigate Amazon and some of its executives for criminal obstruction of a congressional investigation that included the e-commerce giant.
In a letter to Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, members of the Judiciary Committee accused the company of obstructing its 16-month antitrust investigation by refusing to turn over information and lying about how it treated third-party sellers on its platform.
“Throughout the investigation and in follow-up inquiries, senior executives at Amazon engaged in a pattern and practice of misleading behavior before the committee,” a bipartisan group of lawmakers including the committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, said in the letter. “Amazon and its executives must be held accountable for this behavior.”
During its investigation, which was opened in 2019, the House panel’s antitrust subcommittee focused on whether Amazon used data about its customers to advance the sale of its own private-label products over those of third-party vendors. The lawmakers said in their letter that Amazon executives, including a lawyer who testified before the committee, had repeatedly denied that the company used customer data to harm competition.
But The Wall Street Journal and The Markup reported later that former employees and internal documents revealed that the company used data to give Amazon products an unfair boost over competitors and that the company also used its ranking systems to feature company products over those of third-party sellers.
“Amazon was caught in a lie,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter.
Tina Pelkey, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said in a statement on Wednesday that the lawmakers’ concerns were unfounded.
“There’s no factual basis for this, as demonstrated in the huge volume of information we’ve provided over several years of good-faith cooperation with this investigation,” she said.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said it was reviewing the letter.
The letter intensifies pressure on federal regulators to rein in the power of Amazon. The House committee accused Amazon of abusing its position in online commerce to harm competitors that rely on the online platform to sell goods. The antitrust subcommittee also accused Amazon and other tech giants, including Facebook, Google and Apple, of abusing their monopoly power and called for sweeping changes to antitrust laws to curtail the dominance of the Silicon Valley giants.
The Federal Trade Commission opened an antitrust investigation into Amazon about two years ago, and the agency is also reviewing the company’s proposed $8.45 billion merger with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio. Before becoming F.T.C. chair last year, Lina Khan was known for a paper she wrote for the Yale Law Journal, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” which argued that even if it offered more convenience and lower prices for consumers, the company had abused its dominance."
2022-03-10,"Rivian, which has had a rocky ride in the stock market after a blockbuster initial public offering, cast a further shadow over its outlook on Thursday, reporting that supply chain problems could severely constrain its production of electric vehicles.
The company said it would be able to produce only 25,000 vehicles this year, half the number it said it could make if the supply chain were not a “fundamental limiting factor.”
Problems securing parts and materials are affecting all automakers, but they are hitting Rivian when it has sold very few vehicles and faces competition from larger companies.
“Like the rest of the industry, we anticipate supply chain challenges to persist through 2022,” Rivian said in a letter to shareholders that detailed its financial results for last year. On a call with Wall Street analysts on Thursday, R.J. Scaringe, Rivian’s chief executive, said the problems centered on a “small number of parts.”

Rivian makes a high-end truck — designed more as an off-road vehicle than as a cargo hauler — and a sport utility vehicle. Rivian also has an agreement to make electric delivery vans for a big shareholder, Amazon, which has ordered 100,000. When Rivian went public, investors saw it as a possible competitor to Tesla, the largest electric vehicle maker.
The Rise of Electric Vehicles
Affordable Models: More efficient manufacturing, falling battery costs and intense competition are lowering sticker prices for battery-powered vehicles to within striking distance of gasoline cars.
Keeping China Out: President Biden wants to shield American producers of electric vehicles from cheaper Chinese options. Here are the policy and political considerations of Biden’s efforts.
Retiring the Malibu: General Motors said that it would stop making the Chevrolet Malibu, the last affordable sedan in its U.S. model lineup, to produce more electric cars.
Tesla’s Pullback: The automaker led by Elon Musk is no longer planning to take the lead in expanding the number of places to fuel electric vehicles. It’s not clear how quickly other companies will fill the gap.
Rivian said that as of Tuesday, it had produced 1,410 vehicles this year, a small fraction of the 83,000 orders submitted. The company did not say how many vans it had delivered to Amazon this year.
Stock analysts said Rivian’s report was disappointing, and its stock plunged 12 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its results.
“It’s been a very frustrating name,” said Dan Ives, analyst and managing director at Wedbush Securities, “and these results show that Rivian still has a lot more wood to chop.” He said he had originally expected Rivian to make 40,000 vehicles this year, well above the company’s latest forecast, adding that analysts had expected orders for Rivian vehicles to be higher than the 83,000 reported.
Along with other E.V. makers, Rivian must contend with rising prices for lithium and nickel, which are used in making batteries. Russia is a big exporter of nickel, and fears that the metal’s supply could be constrained have driven up its price.

“We hope the inflation that we’ve seen with nickel pricing very recently is short-lived,” Mr. Scaringe said.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Rivian went public in November, raising $13.5 billion — cash it will need to expand its factory in Normal, Ill., and build one in Georgia. The stock soared at first, giving Rivian a market value exceeding that of General Motors, but it is now trading at roughly half its I.P.O. price.
The shares declined in recent months after Rivian said it was facing production challenges, then tumbled further in a customer relations debacle over pricing. Rivian said last week that it would increase the prices of its vehicles, even those already ordered. Facing a backlash, Rivian backtracked and applied the increases only to new orders, and Mr. Scaringe apologized in a letter to customers.
Before the price change, Rivian’s truck and car could cost as much as $83,000. After the introduction of new offerings, the price could reach $95,000.
Rivian had revenue of $55 million last year and a net loss of $4.7 billion. It used up $4.4 billion of cash running its business and investing in new facilities and equipment, and had $18 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of last year. The company said it expected a loss this year of $4.75 billion under a measurement of profits known as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Mr. Ives said investors might also balk at the high level of costs, especially if they were expecting higher order numbers. “The cost overruns are a lot more than the Street expected,” he said. “If preorders were on pace, the Street would be fine with it.”
The executive overseeing Rivian’s operations left last year as the company was trying to ramp up production. On Thursday, Mr. Scaringe said the company would announce a new chief operating officer next week."

“None of us can fail to see this for what it is: the invasion of a sovereign state,” David Solomon, Goldman Sachs's C.E.O., told employees.

Wall Street heads for the exit
Goldman Sachs yesterday became the first major global bank to say it was quitting Russia, followed shortly after by JPMorgan Chase. The Wall Street giants join a growing list of multinational companies that have pledged to stop doing business in Russia. “None of us can fail to see this for what it is: the invasion of a sovereign state,” David Solomon, Goldman’s C.E.O., wrote in a memo to employees.
Big U.S. banks had pulled back from Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. The only major U.S. bank that kept a significant presence is Citigroup, which has about 3,000 employees there and previously said it had nearly $10 billion in exposure to Russia. Citi said on Wednesday that it would “assess our operations in the country”; it had put its consumer division in Russia up for sale last year.
Goldman’s presence in Russia is small in relation to the $1.5 trillion bank’s global operations: Its total credit exposure was $650 million at the end of 2021. The bank has about 80 employees in Russia and is arranging for the departures of those who have asked to leave. (Some have already moved to Dubai.)
JPMorgan said it was “unwinding Russian business” and wouldn’t pursue new ventures there. The bank, which holds assets for some clients in the country, has more than 100 workers there, but the business was not big enough to rank among its top 20 markets.
Wall Street banks haven’t fully cut ties with Russia. Goldman, for example, is reportedly selling Russian debt to hedge funds. Trading in secondary markets is allowed under U.S. sanctions. A Goldman spokesperson told NBC News that the bank is “not engaging in any new bond trades with Russian onshore entities.”
European banks are more enmeshed with Russia. Deutsche Bank’s C.F.O., James von Moltke, said yesterday that it was not “practical” to close its Russia business: “We’re there to support our clients.” (The bank is taking heat for that stance today.) Deutsche added that Russia accounts for just 0.3 percent of its loan book. Other European lenders are far more exposed.
Asset managers are on the hook for huge writedowns. BlackRock is sitting on $17 billion in losses on Russian securities held by its clients, according to the Financial Times. The financial reverberations from sanctions-induced turmoil could also hit financial firms without direct exposure to Russia, as volatility, inflation and other effects cast a cloud over global markets.
More on the Russia-Ukraine war:
Other companies quitting Russia include the carmaker Stellantis and, in a reversal, Uniqlo. Meanwhile, Moscow is looking at nationalizing the assets of foreign companies that exit Russia.

2022-03-12,"WASHINGTON — Beyond the reports of undercounts and overcounts in population totals, there is another takeaway from the post-mortem of 2020 census data issued on Thursday: This could be the last census of its kind.
The next census will be taken in a nation where Amazon may have a better handle on where many people live than the Census Bureau itself. For some advocates of a more accurate count, the era in which census-takers knock on millions of doors to persuade people to fill out forms should give way in 2030 to a sleeker approach: data mining, surveys, sophisticated statistical projections and, if politics allows, even help from the nation’s tech giants and their endless petabytes of personal information.
The Census Bureau itself has yet to leap very far into that new era. But it has hinted recently at a “blended” approach in which official census figures could be supplemented with reliable data from government records and other sources.
That would depart from the longstanding model in which the population tally, taken once every 10 years, was the marker for everything that followed, even if it was long outdated by year six or seven.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“The model we have been using since 1790,” when the first census was conducted, “has run its course,” Kenneth Prewitt, the Columbia University scholar who oversaw the 2000 census, said in an interview. “There’s an amazing amount of work going on about how to improve census forms, to use alternate data sets and administrative records, about working with other places that have a lot of data.”
Businesses and researchers have been using those techniques for years, if not decades. But while some changes in the census seem inevitable, how much remains an open issue.
The Census Bureau has stuck with more traditional survey work in part because of legal constraints — a 1999 Supreme Court ruling barred the bureau from using statistical estimates in population counts to reapportion seats in the House of Representatives. But politicians, experts, local governments and industries that consume Census Bureau data worry that seizing on data from other sources without vetting it could make the bureau’s snapshots of the nation less accurate, not more.
It is an article of faith among data experts and the Census Bureau itself that data obtained directly from people are more reliable than secondhand or thirdhand data from other sources. And experts are wary that other data can raise privacy issues or allegations that it was cherry picked to fit an agenda.
The bureau itself considered tapping secondhand sources like state records to fine-tune its 2020 portraits of the population, but it often shied away unless it could find corroborating information elsewhere, according to Amy O’Hara, a former Census Bureau official who is now the executive director of the Federal Statistical Research Data Center at Georgetown University.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Professor O’Hara said the gusher of public and available data opens new avenues to a far more accurate census, but only if the numbers can be proven accurate and the Census Bureau can navigate the tricky boundary between tapping private research and issuing public statistics.
“There is no significant buy-in yet” to major changes in the census, Terri Ann Lowenthal, a longtime census expert and consultant to governments, businesses and other census “customers,” said in an email. “Too early without research, testing and transparency on those sorts of questions. And there probably will be even greater caution about using third-party commercial data.”
That said, she added, many users of census data agree that better use of outside records, conducted in a way that preserves privacy and credibility, could increase the accuracy of the head count and reduce its staggering cost — $14.2 billion, or about $117 per household counted in the 2020 census.
What seems clear is that the existing way of tallying the nation’s population is pressing its limits. The first census by mail was conducted in 1960. Ever since, the nation has counted itself by tallying census forms filled out on millions of kitchen tables, then dispatching an army of census takers to collect data from the millions of others who didn’t fill them out.
The 2020 census streamlined that process by moving most of the form-filling from cumbersome paper surveys to the internet, and equipping census workers with iPhones and census-taking apps instead of clipboards and paper forms. Online census forms proved a resounding success, census officials say, because they were easier, cheaper and quicker to process, and because the Census Bureau’s computer operations handled them virtually without problems.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Yet despite those improvements, the share of residents who opted to complete census forms remained stuck at two-thirds of all households, where it has sat stubbornly for four decades. The so-called nonresponse follow-up, known as NRFU, of the remaining third, conducted by census workers, was hamstrung by hurricanes, forest fires, political interference and rising suspicion of the government among partisans on the political right and among racial and ethnic groups.
Steve Jost, a former senior census official who is a consultant to the Census Project, a group advocating a more accurate count, lamented that. Tracking down nonresponders eats up roughly half the cost of each census, he said, yet the census still fails to reach 2 to 3 percent of households.
“That disproportionately impacts communities of color,” he said. “How long are we going to beat our heads against it?” The bureau needs to do something new, he added.
Mr. Prewitt and other experts say some solutions are obvious. For decades, the Census Bureau has undercounted some groups, including poorer residents and children, in part because they can be harder to find — they move more frequently, for example — and because census forms can be more confusing to people with less education or poorer language skills.
But state governments maintain accurate birth and death records and manage a range of federal programs aimed at the poor and children, such as Medicaid; the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC; and the SNAP program once known as food stamps. None shares data with the bureau, but an agreement to do so “could probably put a bigger dent in the problem than putting more enumerators on the street,” Mr. Jost said.

There are countless other ways to improve census results. Public and private utility records, for example, assiduously track which residences are occupied or vacant, potentially making it easier for the Census Bureau to compile a more complete and accurate list of households to survey.
The adjustments disclosed on Thursday about flawed counts of people of color stemmed from a two-year spot check of census results that covered 10,000 census blocks, the smallest geographic unit used for counting population. The results of that spot check were extrapolated to the count at large to produce what bureau officials believe were accurate estimates of undercounts and overcounts.
That and other surveys — the Census Bureau conducts hundreds, from its rolling American Community Survey of the general population to reports on labor trends — could be used to update the base census totals. But for decades, Congress has resisted mixing the pen-to-paper, face-to-face census data with numbers politicians might regard as conjured up from smaller samples of people.
Mr. Prewitt’s view is that statistical samples are everyday features of things as common as medical tests, where a small vial of blood can accurately reflect the body as a whole, and that using them to make the census more accurate is overdue. He recalled urging the former House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert to let the bureau rely more on such samples, only to be rebuffed.
“I told him, ‘Next time you get a blood test, have them take all of it out,’” he said."
2022-03-13,"It was reported in The Washington Post this week that the Biden administration has been meeting with popular video creators from the social network TikTok and briefing them on the war in Ukraine, an unconventional move that could help the White House in its information battle … or get it made fun of relentlessly.
And “Saturday Night Live” was happy to assist with that latter option, opening this weekend’s broadcast with a sketch that imagined President Biden (played by James Austin Johnson) trying to communicate his strategic goals to a disparate group of TikTok influencers.
Johnson, as Biden, was joined in the sketch by Kate McKinnon, who played Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. As the meeting began she said, “I suggested it as a joke, and then it actually happened.”
Johnson told the gathering, “People are saying this is the first war fought on TikTok, which is very tough for me because I’m the landline of presidents.”
“I understand Putin,” he added. “I understand war. But there’s one thing I don’t understand: Computer.”"

Hurt’s first big film hit was also his inaugural collaboration with the writer and director Lawrence Kasdan, with whom he would continue to work throughout his ’80s leading man heyday. “Body Heat” is a scorching throwback to the film noir tradition, telling one of the quintessential stories of that period: the rich woman (Kathleen Turner, in an electrifying film debut) who enlists a horny heel (Hurt) to help her bump off her rich husband (Richard Crenna) for the insurance money. The story might have been old hat, but Kasdan took advantage of the looser content restrictions of his era to make the subtext text, crafting pulse-quickening love scenes that take full advantage of Hurt and Turner’s explosive chemistry. Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke also pop up in early roles.

‘The Big Chill’
Kasdan reunited with Hurt for his next directorial effort, an ensemble drama so culturally ubiquitous, its title became generational shorthand. Hurt appears alongside Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, fellow Kasdan favorite Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place and JoBeth Williams as a group of baby boomer college schoolmates who reunite for a weekend away after the suicide of their friend; truths are told, long-buried secrets are revealed, sexual escapades are had and Motown tunes are played. It’s the kind of big, busy movie where actors typically have to make a lot of noise to stick out — but Hurt goes in the opposite direction, playing his impotent, drug-addicted vet character with a kind of quiet, simmering pain that’s impossible to shake.

‘Children of a Lesser God’
Hurt received his second Academy Award nomination for this powerful adaptation of Mark Medoff’s stage play from the director Randa Haines. His role, of a hearing teacher at a school for the deaf who begins a relationship with a fellow employee (an Oscar-winning Marlee Matlin, in her film debut), captures one of the quintessential qualities of Hurt’s persona: bristling intelligence combined with simmering impatience to create an unnervingly explosive personality. He never played easy characters, and would blunt their sympathetic qualities with his own ferocity — but the results, as in this case, were often stunningly affecting. (In her 2010 memoir, Matlin accused Hurt, with whom she had an offscreen relationship, of abuse.)

‘Broadcast News’
Hurt may have had the trickiest acting assignment of his early years in this 1987 Oscar nominee by the writer and director James L. Brooks — which wouldn’t seem to be the case on first glance, as it’s a light romantic comedy. But as Tom Grunick, the up-and-coming network news reporter who’s already being groomed for the anchor seat, Hurt had to both personify all that its idealistic protagonist (Holly Hunter) thought was dangerous, and be charming enough for her to believably fall for him anyway. The actor pulls it off, thanks to a potent combination of aw-shucks charm and on-the-job professionalism; you believe he could do the job he’s doing, you believe she might warm up to him and you still understand why she can’t.

2022-03-15,"The European Commission said on Tuesday that it had “unconditionally” approved Amazon’s $8.45 billion purchase of the movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The transaction would give Amazon, which has become a major player in streaming, control of the James Bond franchise.
The Federal Trade Commission is also vetting the deal. But approval from Brussels is notable because Europe has been particularly aggressive in scrutinizing American tech companies it believes have grown too powerful.
“We’re pleased with the commission’s decision and, with MGM, look forward to providing more choice of quality entertainment for viewers,” an Amazon spokeswoman, Angie Quennell, said in a statement."
2022-03-16,"For the past two years, even as the pandemic shut down key markets and created supply shortages, Kevin Johnson, the chief executive of Starbucks, managed to lead the company to robust revenue and profit growth.
But in recent months, those operational and financial successes have been overshadowed by a wave of employees — “partners” in Starbucks parlance — who have taken to social media to criticize work conditions and raise other issues at the chain. As a result, more than 100 Starbucks stores in more than 25 states have filed for union elections. Many either have begun to vote or are likely to vote in the coming months. At least six have voted to unionize.
On Wednesday, in an abrupt move, Starbucks said Mr. Johnson, who has held the job since 2017, will retire on April 4 after 13 years with the company.
His interim replacement until the board of directors names a permanent one is a familiar name: Howard Schultz.

Mr. Schultz, 68, joined Starbucks in the 1980s and built it into a global coffee giant. And this isn’t the first time he has come back to oversee the company. After stepping down as chief executive in 2000, he returned as C.E.O. from 2008 to 2017, when Mr. Johnson took over and Mr. Schultz became executive chairman. Mr. Schultz will also rejoin the company’s board. Shares of Starbucks rose 4.8 percent to $87.10 on Wednesday.
The unexpected leadership change followed weeks of mounting pressure from investors as more stores filed for union elections. “We believe that Starbucks’s reputation may be jeopardized due to reporting of aggressive union-busting tactics,” a large group of investors, representing more than $1 billion in Starbucks stock, said in a letter sent to Mr. Johnson on Tuesday. Starbucks has denied engaging in anti-union activity.
This week, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint accusing the company of illegally penalizing two workers involved in a union drive at a Starbucks in Phoenix, the latest in the chain’s labor struggles.
It is unclear whether the return of Mr. Schultz signals a softening of the company’s battles against unions or a deeper entrenchment. Mr. Schultz, who stepped down as executive chairman in 2018 and was, at the time, one of the largest Starbucks stockholders with 33 million shares, has played a significant role in the company’s response to stores that have sought to unionize.
In September, Mr. Schultz visited Buffalo to address local managers, telling them that the company had let them down by failing to help them address operational issues at their stores, and that he was not anti-union but “pro-Starbucks,” said one person who attended but was not authorized to speak publicly. Other Starbucks executives, like John Culver, the chief operating officer, and Rossann Williams, president of retail for North America, attended the meeting, but Mr. Johnson did not.

Starbucks declined to make Mr. Schultz and Mr. Johnson available for interviews.
After the leadership change was announced on Wednesday, Mellody Hobson, Starbucks’s chairwoman, acknowledged to CNBC that the company had “made some mistakes” in addressing workers’ concerns. Ms. Hobson is co-chief executive of Ariel Investments, a firm that considers itself an early adopter of environmental, social and governance investing.
Jonas Kron, the chief advocacy officer for Trillium Asset Management, one of the investment firms that has written to and met with Starbucks executives urging them to take a neutral posture, said he believed the comment could be “the first signal of a pivot” on the union issue.
But a few hours later, during the question-and-answer session of Starbucks’s annual shareholder meeting, Ms. Hobson said the issue of neutrality was “nuanced” and would limit “our ability to speak to our partners in certain ways.”
Mr. Kron later said he considered the comments at the meeting “disappointing.”
Various Starbucks executives mentioned during the shareholder meeting how successfully the company had worked with its employees during the pandemic, with pay and other benefits improving over the past year.
Starbucks is one of many companies where employees, many of whom worked long hours and under arduous conditions during the pandemic, are now trying to organize through TikTok and Twitter accounts, seeking better wages, steady hours and increased benefits.

Two weeks ago, employees at a Manhattan location of REI, the outdoor equipment and apparel retailer, voted to create the first union at that company. Voting in union elections at two Amazon warehouses will end this month.
Mr. Johnson, a former senior executive at Microsoft who was Starbucks’s president when he was named chief executive, raised the prospect of stepping down with the board of directors last year, he said in a company statement on Wednesday.
“A year ago, I signaled to the board that as the global pandemic neared an end, I would be considering retirement from Starbucks,” Mr. Johnson said. Starbucks said he would continue to serve on the board and as a consultant through September. The company said it had been planning for the succession since last year and anticipated it would have a new chief executive by fall.
The first time Mr. Schultz returned to Starbucks, he abruptly replaced Jim Donald as chief executive when the company was struggling with a downturn in the economy, an influx of coffee competition and missteps.
This time, while Starbucks is on stronger financial footing, Mr. Schultz will have to deal with the rising union issue, a concern he has faced before.

When he acquired Starbucks in 1987, several of the company’s Seattle stores were unionized, as was its local coffee roasting plant. Mr. Schultz made clear to union officials that he did not welcome the relationship.
“He went ballistic screaming at me, telling me to get out of the plant,” said Pam Blauman-Schmitz, the local union rep for the United Food and Commercial Workers, of her first visit to the plant under Mr. Schultz’s ownership. “He followed me all the way out.”
In the late 1980s, workers at the stores voted to decertify the union, and the roasting plant followed in the early 1990s. In a subsequent book, Mr. Schultz said a single worker “did some research on his own and began an effort to decertify the union.” But he acknowledged that he did not want the company to be unionized. 
“I was convinced that under my leadership, employees would come to realize that I would listen to their concerns,” Mr. Schultz wrote. “If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn’t need a union.”
Union officials believed that Mr. Schultz had played a role in the decertification. “We thought it was initiated by a worker that Howard had handpicked to run the decertification campaign,” Ms. Blauman-Schmitz said.

2022-03-17,"TITAN OF INDUSTRY On the copyright page of Olivie Blake’s fantasy novel “The Atlas Six,” readers might notice an unobtrusive line of print above the ISBN data and below the title. It says, “Edited by Molly McGhee.” In her lengthy acknowledgments section, the formerly self-published author and BookTok sensation whose real name is Alexene Farol Follmuth writes, “Thank you to Molly McGhee, my beloved editor, who soothes my!!!s and???s me at all the right moments. You have contributed so much more to this book and to my earthly existence than you will ever know.”
On March 11, McGhee joined a group of junior and midlevel employees who exited the publishing industry, blaming low pay, unrealistic workloads and burnout. For context: It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to live in or near New York City (epicenter of bookmaking) on an entry-level publishing salary. Add school loans, subtract a second job or additional subsidy and you risk being factored out of a career in letters before the ink on your college diploma has had a chance to dry.
“As some of you may have heard, today is my last day at Tor Books,” McGhee wrote in the resignation letter she shared on Twitter. “My promotion request was denied, and as such I am leaving as my first acquisition (the marvelous THE ATLAS SIX by Olivie Blake) debuts at number three on The New York Times Bestsellers List.” She goes on, “Making the NYT is a career high for an editor. It is rare for an assistant to do so and, by all accounts, this should be ‘a great beginning’ and not a heartbreaking end.”
McGhee also cites “the invisibility of the junior employee’s workload” as one of her reasons for leaving Tor. As Blake writes in her novel, “We are the gods of our own universes, aren’t we?” Indeed we are. But gods cannot live on ramen alone.

RELATIONSHIP GOALS Perhaps Blake and McGhee will consider a partnership like Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen’s? Hendricks edited seven books by Pekkanen before leaving Simon & Schuster, where she’d worked for 20 years. This week, the authors’ fourth co-written best seller, “The Golden Couple,” enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. The novel focuses on a dysfunctional marriage and the unorthodox therapist who attempts to save it. Hendricks and Pekkanen dedicated this one to their editor, Jennifer Enderlin."

If you’ve read the work of brave journalists in Mariupol this week, you know that the people of that city are trying to survive not just shelling by Russian forces. They are also trying to survive without water.
This is, unfortunately, a recurrent feature of war.
We witnessed it in Syria in 2016, for instance, when the residents of Aleppo, the northern city besieged by government forces, were deprived of running water. We saw it again the following year, when residents of the capital, Damascus, had their taps run dry as both sides in the war accused each other of damaging water infrastructure.
In 2018, clashes between rival groups destroyed water tanks at a hospital near the city of Hodeidah, in Yemen. In 2019, Al Shabab, an extremist group, blew up a water tank in Somalia.
These are documented in a logbook of human cruelty, published this week by an Oakland-based research group called the Pacific Institute. It’s called the Water Conflict Chronology, and it enumerates episodes throughout human history where access to water has triggered unrest or become a weapon of war. Sometimes water resources become what the report calls a “casualty” of conflict: Tankers are blown up, wells are poisoned.

Climate change can intensify the risks. A hotter planet often makes dry places drier and hotter, supercharging competition over an already-scarce resource. How much of a role climate change plays in each conflict is hard to know, and, most certainly, poor management and rising demand for water play a role equally if not more important.
But, said Peter Gleick, president emeritus of the Pacific Institute, who has studied water conflicts for decades, “climate change is unambiguously worsening the very conditions that contribute to water conflicts: drought, scarcity and inequities.”
Water conflicts have gone up sharply in the last 20 years, the study found. My colleagues have written about many of them. Farmers and herders have clashed in parts of Africa over access to water, conflicts all the more acute in a region that has suffered from abnormally bad droughts. Antigovernment protests have erupted in Iran over scarce water. Water-sharing has riven several former Soviet states of Central Asia that straddle the Amu Darya River.
Since 2000, Gleick pointed out, a fourth of the conflicts triggered by access to water have been in three water-scarce areas pummeled by global warming: the Middle East, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Separately, the United Nations University estimated that 19 countries in Africa with a total population of 500 million people face water insecurity. At the top of that list are three countries that are no strangers to conflict: Chad, Niger and Somalia. Most nations on the continent face higher levels of risk to extreme weather events, that study adds, as climate change makes them more frequent and more severe, outpacing the countries’ ability to adapt.

In wealthy countries, few places are feeling the impacts of climate change on the water supply as acutely as Gleick’s home state of California.
The long-running drought affecting the Western United States is likely to go on through this spring, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. As my colleague Maggie Astor reported, most of California is returning to “severe” or “extreme” drought after a brief respite over the winter. In Central California, the fruit and nut basket of the country, the three-year precipitation total is “likely to be the lowest since modern record-keeping began in 1922,” Maggie reported.

2022-03-19,"Earlier this month, Juliana Park came upon what appeared like a mirage while shopping at a Target in San Jose, Calif. There, in the pharmacy department, around the corner from the allergy medicine, was an entire shelf of Covid-19 antigen home tests. Box after box of them, all for the taking.
“My jaw literally dropped under my mask,” said Ms. Park, 26, who works in communications for a Bay Area labor union. “I looked to my left, I looked to my right. Why aren’t people running to this corner?”
From the beginning, the pandemic has been characterized by a mismatch between supply and demand in crucial products — masks, toilet paper, semiconductors, cars, housing. So it has been with coronavirus tests.
Wasn’t it only two months ago that everyone was hunting internet sites and going to every drugstore in a 30-mile radius in a futile search for a rapid test kit? During the Omicron surge, tests were so in demand they became one of the season’s top Christmas gifts. Amazon experienced shortages of the tests, and pharmacies had to set strict limits on how many you could buy.

For now, at least, at-home tests are abundant and everywhere.
This month, the Biden administration announced that Americans could order four more free tests per household through the U.S. Postal Service. This follows the test kits the government gave out in January under the same program, part of a plan to buy and distribute one billion tests.
There are at least nine different at-home rapid tests on the market in the United States. One manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories, produced 70 million BinaxNOW tests in the month of January alone, according to the company.
More on Covid-19
Vaccine Side Effects: All vaccines have at least occasional side effects, but thousands of Americans who say they were injured by Covid vaccines believe their cases have been ignored.
Airborne Diseases, Redefined: After a drawn-out global controversy over the coronavirus, the W.H.O. has updated its classification of how pathogens spread through the air.
Four Years Later: Covid was declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020, a moment that changed the world. But even as the threat has faded, the pandemic has reshaped life for many Americans.
Free Covid tests are readily available at public libraries, college bookstores, through local government agencies, private health insurance companies and in many workplaces. It’s a bounty of supply, imperfectly timed to appear when virus cases in the United States are on the decline, and mask and vaccine mandates are being reconsidered.
“It’s unfortunate that we didn’t have these tests earlier, before the Omicron wave, before the Delta wave and, frankly, before 2020,” said Dr. Michael Mina, 38, a pathologist and chief science officer at eMed, a digital health care company that links at-home testing to treatment for patients, including for Covid. “It feels too little too late. But it’s much better to have them available.”
Indeed, not only do many people have tests available, they have amassed stockpiles of them. Mary Robinette Kowal has 23 tests. That doesn’t count the four tests she just ordered through the government program.
ADVERTISEMENT

Ms. Kowal, 53, a novelist who has written about spaceflight for The New York Times and lives in Hamilton County, Tenn., keeps the test kits in a kitchen drawer, close to the entry of her home. She and her husband live with her parents, who are in poor health; throughout the pandemic, she has asked houseguests to test when they come over.
“As case numbers fall, we do relax,” Ms. Kowal said. “On the other hand, the way you know the difference between a cold and Covid is testing.”
Ms. Park has eight boxes of tests, which she keeps in her pantry with her allergy medication and multivitamins. “Eight, objectively, is kind of a lot because these packs have two tests,” she said. “But I keep them in case someone else needs one. I feel comfortable right now at eight.”

Gabby Jones for The New York Times
Nicole Carr, a journalist for ProPublica who lives in the Atlanta metro area, also has eight tests, stored in her kitchen and bathroom, though she would prefer to always have 10, enough for her, her husband and their three children to test twice. Last week, Ms. Carr, 38, ordered more tests from the government, and also realized one of the boxes she had previously bought was about to expire.
Unlike hoarded rolls of toilet paper, it turns out coronavirus tests have a reasonably short shelf life. Some iHealth tests the government sent out in January have an expiration date of July. Though a test is not going to suddenly turn bad on the day of expiration, the chemical components degrade over time, experts said.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“What if you don’t use them? It was a good reminder to line the boxes up in order of expiration,” said Ms. Carr, who added that at-home testing has become “a natural part of planning for our family,” and one that she foresees will continue, at least through this year.
In fact, the overabundance of tests may come in handy, as cases are on the rise in parts of Europe and Asia, and as the highly contagious Omicron subvariant BA.2 now accounts for nearly a quarter of new cases in the United States.
Dr. Michael Misialek, associate chair of pathology at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass., said there is nothing wrong with keeping a small stockpile. Indeed, he encouraged it.
“People should definitely not get worried that, ‘Oh I have too many,’” Dr. Misialek, 53, said. “It’s not a one and done. The real accuracy is improved by doing another one a day or two later. Personally, I have 10 boxes at home.”
In the future, at-home rapid tests may well become part of the first-aid kit of the 21st century, a staple of the medicine cabinet along with Band-Aids and Advil, physicians said.
Ms. Park, whose eyes lit up when she was at Target, can well remember back eight weeks ago, when she didn’t have a single test at home, and couldn’t find one anywhere. She was still in scarcity mode, viewing the tests like a child would a bowl of lollipops.
“The first thought that ran across my head was how many can I buy? Is there a cap?” she said.
A more generous spirit prevailed, however. “For me, it’s the take what I need mentality,” Ms. Park said. “I bought two.”"

A fragile peace
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has amplified fears that the world is teetering back to a Cold War-like era in which the most powerful countries compete for dominance.
That could mean not only Russia exerting control over Eastern Europe but also China imposing itself over East and Southeast Asia — particularly Taiwan.
China has laid claim to Taiwan since the island split off from the mainland in 1949 and has threatened to forcibly reunite the two. It views the issue as a top priority: Days after Russia’s invasion, Chinese officials reiterated that they were committed to “resolving the Taiwan question.” In a Friday call with President Biden about Russia’s invasion, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, seemed more concerned about the fate of Taiwan than the war in Ukraine.
China, like Russia, appears to see a void after Western powers pulled back from the world stage, sidelined by internal disputes and the failed U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the West, a Cold War victory had convinced many that a new democratic world order would keep the peace — without realizing how fragile that peace really was.

“People forgot about great power politics,” said Jennifer Lind, an expert on East Asia at Dartmouth College. “People had hoped we had transformed international politics, and we didn’t.”
But Russia’s failure so far to overpower Ukraine, and the West’s rush to punish and isolate Russia for its invasion, should make great or rising powers skeptical of similar incursions, experts said.
China, after all, has benefited from the relatively peaceful world order of recent decades; it transformed into the only real economic rival to the U.S. as the world became increasingly integrated. An invasion of Taiwan could disrupt that order and potentially isolate China from the global economy, as Russia’s experience has shown.
So what happens in Taiwan will likely be influenced by what happens in Ukraine. If Russia succeeds in overtaking Ukraine, it increases the danger for Taiwan. If Russia ultimately retreats, or suffers lasting, damaging consequences, that could be good news for the island.

Why China might hesitate

Because Russia’s invasion has gone poorly, Chinese officials are likely to be more cautious about sending troops into Taiwan, said Liang-chih Evans Chen at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan.
That would be a relief for Taiwan, an island of almost 24 million people with a strong liberal democracy — it is the only Asian government to legally allow same-sex marriages — and a modern economy.
Taiwan does not expect that it could outright defeat China’s powerful military, especially without direct help from the U.S. Taiwan’s aim, instead, is to make a war look so costly for China that it is deterred from invading.
The war in Ukraine has shown how this could play out. Ukrainian resistance has been fiercer than anyone expected — killing thousands of Russian troops, according to U.S. estimates. The same could prove true in Taiwan, where polls find that nearly three-quarters of the population is willing to fight a Chinese invasion.
The West’s sweeping sanctions on Russia also suggest that an invasion of Taiwan could result in economic pain for China. Along with the weapons shipped to Ukraine, the sanctions show Western countries’ willingness to support democracies that are under attack.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The West’s resolve could go even further in Taiwan, with the possibility of U.S. forces directly intervening against an invasion. Biden has said American troops will not fight in Ukraine, but the U.S. keeps a deliberately vague line on Taiwan.
China’s advantages
China has strengths that Russia does not. Its economy is far bigger and more diversified, cushioning the damage that sanctions could inflict. The countries that would stand to impose sanctions on China, from the U.S. to European nations to Japan, are generally more reliant on trade with China than they are on trade with Russia.
Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan is not recognized globally as an independent country — not even by the U.S. — potentially leading to questions about whether China’s attack would be an invasion at all.
China also has an enormous military advantage, with about a million active-duty ground troops, compared with Taiwan’s 88,000. (Although, unlike Russia, China would have to cross 100 miles of water to invade — a difficult, complex undertaking.)
The reaction to Russia’s invasion has also exposed some limits in how far the West is willing to go, with countries declining to send troops to defend Ukraine. And the U.S.’s ambiguity on Taiwan leaves room for American forces to stay out of combat.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Most important, China has time: Any invasion of Taiwan could be years away, if it happens at all, experts said. That gives China time to build up its military, insulate its economy from possible sanctions, study what Russia got wrong in Ukraine and see whether Western resolve actually holds.
The return of great power politics, then, could hinge on the outcome of the war in Ukraine — and whether it was ultimately worth it from Russia’s perspective.
State of the War
Russia made significant gains yesterday. It pushed into the center of the besieged city of Mariupol, moving closer to linking its forces in Ukraine’s south with separatist allies in the east.
Mariupol is one of several places where Russian forces dealt blows to Ukraine’s military. Russia also destroyed a barracks in the south, killing at least 40 marines in one of the deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the war began, and took out a weapons depot in the west.
Russia said it had used hypersonic missiles to destroy the depot, but that could not be independently confirmed. Launching the missiles would be an escalation and the first use of such weapons in combat; they can travel at five times the speed of sound.
Russia appears to be digging in for a long fight around Kyiv, its biggest prize. Satellite imagery showed Russian forces establishing defensive positions.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky called for direct negotiations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, but a Turkish official said Putin was not ready.
More on Ukraine
Ukrainians placed 109 empty strollers on a public square to symbolize children killed in Russian bombardments.
The Biden administration is trying to help Ukraine without inciting broader conflict, leading to sometimes tortured policy distinctions.

With 70 percent of Americans watching more TV in 2021 than they did in 2020, binge-watching has skyrocketed during the pandemic. Now, as borders reopen, restrictions ease and travel restarts, tour advisers are fielding an increasingly popular request: immersive, TV-themed itineraries that allow travelers to live out their favorite shows’ story lines.
In Britain, where all travel restrictions are now lifted, hotels in London have partnered with Netflix to offer Lady Whistledown-themed teas inspired by “Bridgerton” high society. In Yellowstone National Park, travelers are arriving in Wyoming not for a glimpse of Old Faithful, but for a chance to cosplay as John Dutton from the hit drama “Yellowstone.”
And in South Korea, where vaccinated travelers can now enter without quarantine, street food vendors on Jeju Island are anticipating a run on dalgona candy, the honeycomb toffees that played a central role in “Squid Game.”
“When you fall in love with a character, you can’t get it out of your mind,” said Antonina Pattiz, 30, a blogger who last year got hooked on “Outlander,” the steamy, time-traveling drama about Claire Beauchamp, a nurse transported 200 years back in history. Ms. Pattiz and her husband, William, binge-watched the Starz show together, and are now planning an “Outlander”-themed trip to Scotland in May to visit sites from the show, including Midhope Castle, which stands in as Lallybroch, the family home of another character, Jamie Fraser.

Mr. Pattiz is part Scottish, Ms. Pattiz said, and their joint interest in the show kicked off a desire on his part to explore his roots. “You watch the show and you really start to connect with the characters and you just want to know more,” she said.
The fifth season of “Outlander” was available in February 2020, and Starz’s 142 percent increase in new subscribers early in the pandemic has been largely attributed to a jump in locked-down viewers discovering the show. During the ensuing two-year hiatus before Season 6 recently hit screens — a period of time known by fans as “Droughtlander” — “Outlander”-related attractions in Scotland, like Glencoe, which appears in the show’s opening credits and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, saw more than 1.7 million visitors. “Outlander”-related content on Visit Scotland’s website generated more than 350,000 page views, ahead of content pegged to the filming there of Harry Potter and James Bond movies.
The Pattizs, who live in New York City, will follow a 12-day self-driving sample itinerary provided by Visit Scotland, winding from Edinburgh to Fife to Glasgow as they visit castles and gardens where Claire fell in love and Jamie’s comrades died in battle. Private tour companies, including Nordic Visitor and Inverness Tours, have also unveiled customized tours.

Enduring trend, new intensity
Screen tourism, which encompasses not just pilgrimages to filming locations but also studio tours and visits to amusement parks like The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, is an enduring trend. Tourists flocked to Salzburg in the 1960s after the release of “The Sound of Music”; in recent decades, locations like New Zealand saw a huge bump in visits from “Lord of the Rings” fans and bus tours in New York City have offered tourists a chance to go on location of “Sex and the City” and “The Marvelous Ms. Maisel.”
But in this pandemic moment, where travel has for months been synonymous with danger and tourists are navigating conflicting desires to safeguard their health while also making up for squandered time, screen tourism is taking on a new intensity, said Rachel Kazez, a Chicago-based mental health therapist. She has clients eager to travel — another major trend for 2022 is “going big” — but they are looking for ways to tamp down the anxiety that may accompany those supersized ambitions.

She said her patients increasingly are saying “‘I was cooped up for a year and I just want to go nuts. Let’s do whatever fantasy we’ve been thinking about’.”
“If we’ve been watching a TV show, we know everything about it, and we can go and have a totally immersive experience that’s also extremely predictable,” Ms. Kazez continued.
Cyndi Lam, a pharmacist in Fairfax, Va., has longed to go to Morocco for years. But she didn’t feel confident pulling the trigger until last month, when “Inventing Anna,” the nine-episode drama about the sham heiress Anna Delvey, began streaming on Netflix.
In episode six of “Inventing Anna,” the character flies to Marrakesh and stays at La Mamounia, a lavish five-star resort. Ms. Lam and her husband are now booked to stay there in September.

“Everybody can kind of relate to Anna,” Ms. Lam said. “I found her character to be fascinating, and when she went to Morocco, I was like, ‘OK, we’re going to Morocco.’ It sealed the deal.”

Sensing a new desire among guests to tap into the scripted universe, dozens of hotels over the past year have rolled out themed suites inspired by popular shows. Graduate Hotels has a “Stranger Things”-themed suite at its Bloomington, Ind., location, with areas designed like the living room and basement of central characters like the Byers. A blinking alphabet of Christmas lights and Eleven’s favorite Eggo waffles are included. And in December, Club Wyndham teamed up with the Hallmark Channel to design three “Countdown to Christmas”-themed suites where guests could check in and binge Christmas films. They sold out in seven hours.
“It was the first time we’d done anything like this,” said Lara Richardson, chief marketing officer for Crown Media Family Networks, in an email. “One thing we hear over and over from viewers is that, as much they love our products, they want to step inside a ‘Countdown to Christmas’ movie.”

Vacation homes are also going immersive. For families, Airbnb partnered with BBC to list the Heeler House, a real-world incarnation of the animated home on the beloved animated series “Bluey,” and Vrbo has 10 rental homes inspired by “Yes Day,” the 2021 Netflix film about parents who remove “no” from their vocabulary. Celebrities are jumping in, too: Issa Rae, creator and star of HBO’s “Insecure,” offered an exclusive look at her neighborhood in South Los Angeles in February with a special Airbnb listing, at a rock-bottom price of $56.
Tea on TV, now in London (and Boston)
“Bridgerton,” Netflix’s British period drama about family, love and savage gossip, was streamed by 82 million households in 2021. (For comparison, the finale of “Breaking Bad” in 2013 had 10.3 million viewers; more recent streaming hits, including “Tiger King” and “Maid,” had fewer than 70 million).

When season two of “Bridgerton” premieres on March 25, Beaverbrook Town House, a hotel built across two Georgian townhouses in London’s Chelsea, will offer a “Bridgerton” experience that includes a day out in London and drinks in the British countryside; nearby at the Lanesborough, a Bridgerton-themed tea, cheekily dubbed “the social event of the season,” will kick off the same day. In Boston, the Fairmont Copley Plaza now has a “High Society Package” for fans with flowers and a private afternoon tea.
Contiki, the group travel company for 18- to 35-year-olds, had a “Bridgerton”-themed itinerary set for September 2021 but had to scrap it when the Delta variant hit; they’ve now partnered with Amazon Prime on a Hawaiian Islands trip inspired by “I Know What You Did Last Summer” set for July.
Both Netflix and Amazon Prime have brand partnership teams that handle collaborations of this nature.
“As we come out of this pandemic, the desire for more immersive experiences is really stronger than ever,” said Adam Armstrong, Contiki’s chief executive. “It’s about getting under the skin of destinations, creating those Instagrammable moments that recreate stuff from films and movies. It’s really a strong focus for us.”
The popularity of “Bridgerton” on Netflix was eclipsed by “Squid Game,” the high-stakes South Korean survival drama, and despite that show’s carnage, travelers are booking Squid Game vacations, too. Remote Lands, an Asia-focused travel agency, reported a 25 percent increase in interest in South Korean travel and created a Seoul guide for fans and a customized itinerary.

Some travel advisers say that some clients don’t even want to explore the locations they’re traveling to. They just want to be there while they continue binge-watching.
Emily Lutz, a travel adviser in Los Angeles, said that more than 20 percent of her total requests over the past few months have been for travel to Yellowstone National Park, a result of the popularity of “Yellowstone,” the western family drama starring Kevin Costner on the Paramount Network and other streaming services. And not all of her clients are interested in hiking.
“I had a client who wrote me and said, ‘All we want to do is rent a lodge in the mountains, sit in front of the fireplace, and watch episodes of ‘Yellowstone’ — while we’re in Yellowstone’,” she said.

Good morning. It’s Tuesday. Today we’ll find out about urban bounty hunters who search for trucks that are parked with their engines running. We’ll also look at a photographer’s images of encounters during the pandemic.

Sarah Blesener for The New York Times
New York City has a clean-air program that allows people to report commercial vehicles that are parked and idling for more than three minutes, or one minute outside a school. Those who report infractions by submitting a video can collect 25 percent of the fine collected by the city — $87.50 on a $350 fine.
This has given rise to a particular breed of urban bounty hunter — people who hunt down idling trucks and shoot videos, sometimes surreptitiously. I asked my colleague Michael Wilson, who wrote about people who do this, to explain.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Are they environmentalists or bounty hunters? What’s uppermost in their minds, clean air or the money they stand to make because the city gives 25 percent of the fines to those who report infractions?
These “idling warriors” are pretty up front about how great the money can be. But they are also very passionate about clean air. One man I spoke to, Ernest Welde, actually became an environmental lawyer to address air pollution. He was confronting idling truck drivers for years before this program came about. So it goes both ways.
These people are urging the city to raise fines, which would increase their bounties, to be sure, but also because they believe the current fine schedule is too low for a company like Amazon to really care about.
How much do they make doing this in, say, a year? Is it enough that they’re living on the money they make?
For everyone I spoke to, this is a side gig — just extra money in their pockets. For instance, the lawyers I spoke to have full-time jobs already. And the retired guys I met seemed to be living comfortably before the program.
But one of them, Paul Slapikas, said he pulled down $64,000 last year, which is certainly not nothing. I actually think other people make more than that, but several bounty hunters declined to share that information with me.
One shorthand estimate is the fact that about 20 people collected most of the $700,000 paid out last year, some more than others.

How much of a problem are idling trucks? How much are they contributing to air pollution, especially when they idle longer than three minutes?
This is a tough one, I found. There are no go-to studies that I’m aware of — and I could be wrong — that get at this question.
But there is no shortage of reports on the health ramifications of breathing in the kinds of pollutants associated with exhaust fumes. A pediatrician I spoke to warned of the effects of these fumes on children, who can suffer lifetime issues.
People in the trucking industry point out that emissions are far, far cleaner than in decades past. But it’s still illegal to idle for excessive periods.

How dangerous is making videos of trucks like this? Some of the people you interviewed said they’d been assaulted.
I think the danger element is pretty rare, but when it surfaces, it sounds stressful, yes. One encounter led to a lawsuit. A guy who was filming a truck claims the driver and his co-workers knocked him down.
There’s no question that it gets your adrenaline going, making this secret video and being close enough to a truck to capture the engine noise without being noticed. I loved seeing all the strategies to disguise what you’re doing. One man puts the phone in his shirt pocket while it’s filming. Another pretends he’s on a FaceTime call. And Paul Slapikas has a whole routine with props, while the phone that’s recording is not even in his hands.

Challenging a DNA database
The New York Police Department instructs detectives to offer something — water, soda, a cigarette or gum — to people they are questioning about a crime and to collect the cup, can, butt or wrapper when they leave. The DNA is collected, tested and entered into a city database.
The Legal Aid Society said in a class-action lawsuit filed on Monday that the database violates state law and constitutional protections against unreasonable searches. The lawsuit calls for DNA profiles that lawyers argue were gathered illegally to be deleted and for the database to be shut down.
Sgt. Edward Riley, a police spokesman, said in a statement that officials believed the use of DNA followed the law.

New York State law requires a conviction or a court order before someone’s DNA can be stored in a state-run databank. But the city’s database includes DNA from people like Shakira Leslie who have been arrested or questioned but not convicted. Leslie, 26, was a passenger in a friend’s car that the police pulled over for a traffic infraction in the Bronx in 2019.
The police searched her and found nothing illegal. But when the officers found a gun in another passenger’s bag, everyone in the car was arrested, charged with possession of a weapon and taken to a precinct. There, she was given a cup of water.
She was released hours later, and the weapons charge was dropped. Later she learned that the police had taken her DNA from the cup without asking. They later tested it and used it to rule her out as a suspect.
“I was shocked, upset,” said Leslie, who is a plaintiff in the Legal Aid lawsuit. “I just felt violated. I completely lost trust for N.Y.P.D.”

Soon after the term “social distancing” entered the language, the photographer Renate Aller decided to document what staying six feet apart from other people looked like. She invited friends over, one at a time, or invited herself to where they live. Either way, she stayed outside. She placed two chairs on the sidewalk in front of her building in SoHo — or theirs, when she went visiting — and put her camera across the street, setting the timer to take nine shots, with three seconds between each one.
Then she crossed the street, walked into the pictures and sat down. Sometimes she and the other person in each image looked into the camera. Sometimes they looked at each other. Sometimes they danced. Always they were six feet apart — thus the title “Sidewalk, 6’ Apart in New York City” for an exhibition of the photographs at the New-York Historical Society.
It was the first time in weeks that many of the people in the photographs had encountered others in the outside world. Aller contrasted those early weeks of the pandemic with the first few weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center in 2001. Then, Aller said, “People were scared to be outside. This was the opposite. We were scared to be inside.”

METROPOLITAN DIARY
March 2020

To mark the two years of the pandemic, this week’s Metropolitan Diary entries features reader tales of life in New York City during the pandemic.
Dear Diary:
I was working at a coffee shop in Midtown near Grand Central Terminal in early March 2020. Toward the end of the morning rush one day, I turned around from the counter to take care of some basic tasks that had been neglected in the chaos.
When I turned back, I saw it: a single N95 mask, wrapped in plastic, on top of the pastry case.
I asked a man who was waiting for the cappuccino he had ordered whether it belonged to him.
He shook his head. So did the other people in the line.
Whoever had left it was gone or didn’t want to be identified — a stranger who, in the middle of panic and confusion, saw me and chose to help.

NATO bolsters troop presence near Ukraine
NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, announced plans to double the alliance’s battlegroups on its eastern flank — in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia — hours before President Biden was set to land in Brussels for a major summit with allies.
The NATO action and the upcoming meetings are part of a coordinated effort by the West to push for tougher penalties to prevent Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from growing into a wider conflict. Biden is expected to target Russian lawmakers with new sanctions this week.
On the ground in Kyiv, Ukraine, a hail of rockets landed in a residential area near the city center, causing extensive damage but few casualties. Russia’s progress has been slow: British intelligence has suggested that the battlefield in the north of the country has stayed largely static for days. Here’s a map tracking the movement of troops in Ukraine.
Appeals abroad: In brief remarks to Japan’s Parliament, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, appealed to the country’s memories of nuclear disaster and a chemical-weapon attack in an attempt to garner support.
Europe’s forces: Germany’s Nazi past has made it reluctant to invest in military power. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany revolutionized its security doctrine, but its military isn’t ready to lead.
Dissent: Russia’s failure to execute a quick takeover of Ukraine is causing some in Moscow to question the military leadership of Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Putin’s climate envoy was reported to have quit, becoming the senior-most Russian government official to do so because of the war.
Spyware: The Israeli government rejected requests from Ukraine and Estonia in recent years to purchase and use Pegasus, a powerful spyware tool, fearing it would damage Israel’s relationship with Russia.

Across Asia, Covid rules are swiftly disappearing
Covid restrictions had largely vanished in India by the time millions of people celebrated a Hindu festival last weekend. In the Philippines, where thousands gathered at a political rally on Sunday, Covid protocols had taken a back seat.
Many Asian-Pacific countries are dismantling their yearslong Covid rules at breakneck speeds, even though the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is still raging in parts of the region. The changes are driven by a mix of medical advice, economic pressures and the sentiment of a pandemic-weary public.
New Zealand announced plans to loosen more restrictions, which had been some of the world’s toughest. And Japan, which had some of the tightest entry barriers, is considering removing quarantine requirements for foreign businesspeople and students.
The one major exception is mainland China, which continues to have strict Covid restrictions after long adhering to its “zero Covid” approach.

Taliban renege on promise to open girls’ schools
The Taliban abruptly reversed their decision to allow girls’ high schools to reopen this week, saying that they would remain closed until officials could assure their accordance with Islamic law.
Many of the over one million high-school-aged girls who had grown up in an era of opportunity for women were devastated by the news. Some found out after they had already arrived for classes yesterday. One 12th-grade student in Kabul said the decision had stamped out her last bit of hope that she could achieve her dream of becoming a lawyer.
A spokesman for the Taliban’s Ministry of Education said they had decided not to allow girls to return because of a lack of a religious uniform and female teachers, among other issues.
The move could threaten the Taliban’s ability to secure billions of dollars of humanitarian aid. It comes a little more than a week before a pledging conference where the U.N. had hoped donor countries would commit millions of dollars in badly needed assistance. Both the U.N. and the U.S. condemned the Taliban’s decision.

Elsewhere in Afghanistan: While many girls were blocked from classrooms in Kabul and elsewhere, at least two northern cities began their semesters as planned, a geographic discrepancy indicative of the Taliban’s largely erratic policymaking.

Filming Gotham (in Liverpool)
In the newest Batman movie, released earlier this month, the skyscrapers and imposing architecture of the fictional metropolis Gotham are featured prominently.
But rather than filming in New York — the city most closely associated with Gotham — “The Batman” used the streets of Liverpool as the latest backdrop for the superhero.
Gotham’s city hall is actually St. George’s Hall in Liverpool, and a statue shown outside in the movie is Benjamin Disraeli, a 19th-century British prime minister. “The Batman” is the latest in a string of movies and TV shows — fueled especially by streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime — to bring production to Britain.
More than 80 percent of the spending on film and high-end TV productions in Britain is from American and other overseas production companies. But local authorities have also capitalized on the trend. Liverpool’s film office invested $2.6 million in six TV shows and set aside millions more for studio space.

Childcare in America is already a nightmare. This is before you add a potentially demonic nanny and a baby that might not be an actual baby. This series, which stars Lauren Ambrose, Nell Tiger Free, Rupert Grint and Toby Kebbell, takes place almost entirely within a claustrophobic Philadelphia rowhouse. Even if you love horror, the Shyamalan brand of slow-burn domestic terror — M. Night is an executive producer and sometimes directs, and his daughter Ishana writes and also directs — has a very particular flavor. (Considering how many scenes showcase rotting or infested food, is that flavor good?) Season 3 concludes on Friday, with the fourth and final season already ordered for next year.

‘The Opposite of Oprah’s Book Club’
In his Thursday night monologue, Jimmy Kimmel said Ted Cruz “even outslimed himself” at Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Senate confirmation hearings this week.
“On Tuesday, you know, he singled out this children’s book called ‘Anti-Racist Baby’ for promoting critical race theory, which it actually doesn’t. He said the book teaches that babies are born racist, which it also doesn’t. And, as a result of Ted’s tirade, that book is now number one on Amazon — it’s the number one seller. It’s like the opposite of Oprah’s Book Club or something.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
“And not only is the book selling well, since Cruz’s little grandstand, Amazon is also seeing a spike in sales of psoriasis medication, wart remover, nose hair trimmers, male Spanx, slug repellent and mullet combs.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
“If you’re wondering what Ted Cruz was really focused on during the hearings, somebody got a shot of him on his phone searching for his own name on Twitter. How embarrassing. And can you imagine being Ted Cruz and still wanting to know what people were saying about you online?” — JIMMY KIMMEL

2022-03-26,"SUNDAY PUZZLE — This grid is built on an exuberant historical theme, and it delights me that it sprang from the mind of August Lee-Kovach. August is making his Sunday debut as the youngest constructor of a Sunday Times puzzle, at the age of 14 years 11 months. He is a freshman at Concord-Carlisle High School in Concord, Mass., and started solving crosswords with his family at age 9. (Someone would read clues aloud, and anyone could call out answers.) This is his third puzzle for The Times since last October, when he started his run with an excellent Saturday crossword.
The historical theme is one of the subjects that I remember being fascinated by as a student (along with other ancient civilizations, faraway places like Tibet and the Amazon and crowd pleasers like dinosaurs, of course). As I worked my way through the puzzle, I felt increasingly nostalgic and appreciated that someone roughly my age back then had created this elaborate challenge.
Tricky Clues
There are many other examples of this type of trivia in the filler entries of today’s puzzle, most of them somewhere in my memory once I jogged it — TOGAS, AD ASTRA, TOGO and so on. I had no idea who ALEX the lion or REX the dinosaur was, but that X was the only spot I couldn’t identify using a crossing entry.
23A. This vehicle pops up as a clue every decade or so, but it’s easy to write “caravan” instead of EUROVAN in this spot if you’re not a “van life” aficionado.
109A. Here’s another clue that took me back to junior high. Learning about Gregor Mendel’s study of peas was when I picked up some knowledge of plant anatomy, including the contents of pollen — GAMETES. (On a related note, the clue for GENE is great.)
116A. This element appears in a Times puzzle for the first time since 1965 and is one of the rarest metals on Earth. The German river that inspired its name is the Rhine, and the element itself is RHENIUM, with the chemical symbol Re."
2022-03-27,"Along Dubai’s 14-lane Sheikh Zayed Road, amid the cascading skyscrapers, the elevated subway and U.S. fast food chains, a nine-floor elliptical curiosity has slowly taken shape over the last several years.
The Museum of the Future, the $136 million government-sponsored museum that opened last month, gives visitors a peek into tomorrow. But the project also is an example of how buildings may be designed and assembled for decades to come: a blend of human skill and digital power.
With an elliptical void at the center of its torus shape — described by some as a giant eye, others as a misshapen doughnut and The Architect’s Newspaper as “the Paul Bunyan-sized pinky ring” — the 320,000-square-foot building has no columns to support its structure. Instead it relies on a network of 2,400 steel tubes that intersect diagonally in its outer frame and onto which slabs of concrete flooring and almost 183,000 square feet of cladding were attached.

Surrounding this on the 189,444-square-foot facade are 1,024 stainless steel panels incised with a message of hope for the future from Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, whose vision of the emirate as a hub of innovation inspired the museum’s development.

The message was rendered in 3-foot-tall Arabic calligraphy designed by the Emirati artist Mattar Bin Lahej. The incisions created windows in the facade, allowing flashes of sunlight into the building during the day and, thanks to LED lighting outlining the windows’ shapes, illumination at night.
“I see the building as the future, but calligraphy as our country’s legacy,” said Mr. Bin Lahej, who designed the variation of the slanting thuluth script used in the project. “I needed to make something for the future from the past.”
The museum has six floors of exhibits that imagine life in the year 2071, including a space station (named OSS Hope, the same name the United Arab Emirates gave the spacecraft that began orbiting Mars last month) and a digitally re-created Amazon rainforest. There is a children’s area, a 345-seat theater and a cavernous top-floor that could accommodate as many as 1,000 people for a meeting or event.
And it all started with a computer algorithm, said the building’s architect, Shaun Killa, of the Dubai architecture firm Killa Design.

“We fed a computer what’s called a parametrically scripted growth algorithm,” he said. “You give it the rules. You say you want this many floors and this much height. You have to teach the algorithm to think, but then you go away on your weekend and see what it comes up with.”
Mr. Killa said a combination of architectural software and engineering design created about 20 versions of the building’s steel frame, and he and his team narrowed the choices to the most efficient in terms of cost, minimum material usage and ease of assembly.
Once the final design was chosen, “we used 3-D modeling software to set the calligraphy onto the building’s surface,” Mr. Killa said. “We then had to make sure that over 1,000 steel diagrid nodes that the building required were not going to land on the windows.”
From there, a local facade design company, Affan Innovative Structures, created the molds for the external panels (each taking one to three days to make). Using all four of its massive mold-making machines, it still took almost three years to create all the molds.
“If it hadn’t been for all the computer-driven machinery, it would probably have taken double the time and the staff,” Mr. Killa said. “It helps when you have a 22-kilowatt machine smashing out those molds and not taking holidays or Ramadan off.”
For Tobias Bauly of the British engineering consultancy Buro Happold, who was the museum’s project director, the brilliance of the project was both the digital imagining of it all and its translation into the manufacturing process.

Each 3-D facade panel was first created digitally, and that data then was sent to Affan’s four large robotized computerized numerical control (C.N.C.) routers, which use massive drill bits on crane rails to punch out large-scale designs. Those giants bits created a perfect mold of each facade panel, and then fiberglass and carbon fiber were laid on.

“The facade panels are entombed in their molds and then are vacuum bagged and cured in supersized ovens to activate and solidify the fiberglass and carbon fiber layers together,” Mr. Bauly explained. “What pops out of the mold is the structural chassis of the facade panel, including the calligraphy cutouts for the glazing.”
But the work wasn’t done just yet. “The stainless steel skin, which is laser-cut to help it adopt to the panel’s surface, is placed in the oven to conform and bond it to the fiberglass panel,” he added.
In the end, each panel was a composite of glass fiber reinforced plastic and an outer skin of stainless steel. The calligraphy incisions, mostly ranging from three to eight feet wide, created the hundreds of different shapes into which matching glass panes were affixed.
“We used a glass-reinforced fiber facade, using a process you see a lot in high-end boat making and with similar technologies to the wings of aircraft,” said Majed Ateeq Almansoori, deputy executive director at Dubai Future Foundation, which operates the museum. “We had to ensure that the facade was strong enough to withstand both the weather and aging.”

When installation of the exterior panels began, digital technology came to the fore once again.
“Each time you install a piece, the building naturally shifts a little to take up the load, which happens with any building,” Mr. Bauly said. “But we had to analyze complex movements in all directions given the shape, a process that allowed us to check pieces digitally before fabrication and then install them in the right sequence accordingly.”

All the steel tubes were welded together, and the facade panels then bolted to brackets on those tubes. “We then had to ensure every panel could be adjusted to sit perfectly against its neighboring panels and that components of the facade could be easily replaced,” Mr. Almansoori said. “We don’t get much rain in the U.A.E., but it’s extremely humid and that is a challenge for any facade, as well as the heat and dust.”
The building’s internal sheath of white gypsum, in addition to the building’s insulation, help shield visitors from the heat during the summer, when temperatures typically soar to 46 degrees Celsius (115 degrees Fahrenheit) for days on end.
Also, “the gypsum layer helps people laser-focus on the calligraphy,” said Khalfan Belhoul, the foundation’s chief executive. “That layer shades out everything else, such as the brightness of the stainless steel.”
The process of creating the gypsum layer — essentially a mirror image of the exterior skin — involved hundreds of workers. It took them more than two years to laser cut the window incisions, Mr. Bauly said, using the 3-D model to match up with the exterior facade.

“Technology and automation defined every piece of this museum, but the adjustments took human intervention,” Mr. Belhoul said. “In the actual installation, it was more about humans than cranes.”
That sentiment was echoed by many of those involved in the museum’s concept and execution — from the first algorithm to the last piece of gypsum.
“I can’t tell you the joy when we fitted the first rung of panels and it all matched up. Perfectly,” Mr. Bauly said. “Everything we have ever known about buildings has changed with this one project.”"
2022-03-28,"TOKYO — The last time a Japanese entry won the Oscar for best international film 13 years ago, it was something of an upset, surprising the forecasters who had barely heard of “Departures,” Yojiro Takita’s story about an accidental undertaker, before the ceremony.
Japanese cinema, after all, had long since faded from its mid-20th century glory, when critics and other filmmakers from around the globe celebrated directors like Akira Kurosawa, Kenji Mizoguchi and Yasujiro Ozu as giants of world cinema.
This year’s winner, “Drive My Car,” Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s quiet, devastating meditation on grief and art and human connection, was the overwhelming favorite in the international category, and was also nominated for best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture.
Mr. Hamaguchi’s Oscar win is something of a capstone to a slow-burn return of Japanese filmmakers to international acclaim. Three years ago, Hirokazu Kore-eda’s “Shoplifters” was also nominated in the international category at the Academy Awards after winning the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and Kiyoshi Kurosawa won best director at the Venice Film Festival in 2020 for “Wife of a Spy.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Yet in some ways the international success of “Drive My Car” derives from its transcendence of the constraints of an insular domestic film industry where most movies never make it off Japan’s shores.
Mr. Hamaguchi’s movie, based on short stories by Haruki Murakami, portrays “a Japan that is easy to accept and understand for foreigners,” said Tamaki Tsuda, a television producer and former film critic in Tokyo. The content of the film is by definition international: The main character directs a theater production of Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya” featuring actors from multiple countries speaking different languages, including Korean sign language.

A High-Tech Transformation: TSMC, Taiwan’s semiconductor giant, is quickly remaking a farm town in Japan into Asia’s next hub of chip manufacturing with enormous support from the Japanese government.
A Belated ‘Oppenheimer’ Opening: While some viewers lamented the movie’s exclusion of scenes from Hiroshima or Nagasaki, others said they recognized that it had another story to tell.
It “touches upon feelings that everyone holds but rarely says,” Ms. Tsuda said. “It’s not a movie where you have to understand Japan to really like it and understand it.”
Mr. Hamaguchi, in a backstage interview after his Oscar win, said he thought that the movie’s themes translated well across borders. “I think this story about loss, and how to live on after loss, resonated with a lot of people,” he said through an interpreter.
The movie, which presented a cosmopolitan Japan and portrayed characters living in social isolation, may also have echoed current Western impressions of Japanese society.

“We are looking at what vision of Japanese-ness that the broader international culture has of Japan at the moment,” said Jennifer Coates, a senior lecturer in Japanese studies at Sheffield University in Britain. With news media portrayals of a loneliness epidemic or the phenomenon of extreme recluses known as “hikikomori,” the kinds of films that have touched critics and audiences outside Japan feature “a detached style” in “films about quiet trauma,” Ms. Coates said.
Still, unlike “Parasite,” the South Korean thriller about class struggle directed by Bong Joon Ho that made Oscar history as the first film not in the English language to win the Academy Award for best picture in 2020, “Drive My Car” does not deal with problems in Japanese society head on. Its social message is perhaps quieter, nudging Japan away from an inward focus in a country where borders are still closed to international tourists and immigration is still something of a touchy subject.

The movie has not been a particular box office success in Japan, where it has taken in only 889 million yen (just over $7 million) in ticket sales since its release in August, with most of its viewers in Japan coming only after its Oscar nomination. “The foreign award nominations are what got Japanese off their sofas to go to the theaters,” Ms. Tsuda said.
Its lackluster domestic performance is notable in a country where homegrown movies have been outselling American blockbusters for the last 14 years.

Mr. Hamaguchi did not make his movie within Japan’s mainstream studio system, where financing comes from a nexus of film producers, advertising agencies, television networks and even cosmetics companies, a system that often deprives directors of artistic independence. Instead, he sought independent funding from small production companies with little marketing muscle for the domestic market.
“It’s possible to argue that ‘Drive My Car’ is actually an argument against the Japanese film industry,” said Aaron Gerow, a professor of East Asian literature and film at Yale who specializes in Japanese cinema. “There might be some people who say, Wow, it won the Oscar and the Japanese film industry is going to benefit from this. But there is an argument for saying, No it won’t, because this is a film that is in some ways opposed to the Japanese film industry.”
Japanese moviegoers spent about 162 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in theaters last year, with nearly 80 percent of those tickets sold for movies made in Japan. Yet many of the domestically produced films have little chance of finding an international audience, film scholars say, in part because they are not of very high quality.
“A lot of film and television production in Japan is hampered by very mediocre acting,” said Kerim Yasar, an assistant professor of East Asian languages and cultures at the University of Southern California. Many movies cast so-called idols who appear on television variety shows, have little theatrical training, and are more akin to social media “influencers” than serious actors.
In Japan, reception to Mr. Hamaguchi’s win was tepid. Hirokazu Matsuno, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, offered congratulations in a daily briefing for reporters. But Kenji Komine, a film and television correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan’s largest newspapers, described the award for “Drive My Car” as a “very embarrassing situation” because the film had not been backed by mainstream studios and received so little funding.

In a brief email exchange, Shigehiko Hasumi, a former president of the University of Tokyo and a mentor of Mr. Hamaguchi’s, said he had “no interest in the Academy Awards,” and wrote that “Drive My Car” is “hardly an excellent work” without further explanation.
Still, Ms. Tsuda, the television producer, said the Oscar success of “Drive My Car” might yet prompt more Japanese filmmakers to consider an international audience.
“Especially now, with the existence of streaming, Netflix, Amazon and such, Japanese movies and TV shows are streamed all around the world and accessible,” Ms. Tsuda said. “So I think people need to be aware of a foreign audience and what perceptions they may have.”
For his part, Mr. Hamaguchi said he was not thinking much about a broader audience when he made the film. “I myself am a film viewer, so therefore I have my own standards,” he said in the backstage interview after the Oscars. “So I am thinking about my own personal standards and whether the filmmaking that I am doing is meeting those standards.”

2022-03-30,"Fraud is a year-round activity, but tax season brings an uptick in calculated schemes to steal money and personal information through spoofed messages and other means. Cybersecurity firms have also reported an increase in fraud attempts that exploit the conflict in Ukraine — a situation that has increased fears of potential cyberattacks on American companies through ransomware and other malicious software. You can better protect yourself if you know what’s out there. Here’s a guide.
Avoid the Tax Scam
The Internal Revenue Service doesn’t make first contact with taxpayers by email, text messages or social media channels to request personal and financial information — including bank-account or credit-card numbers, passwords or PIN codes. Messages asking for that information are deceptive “phishing” attempts to steal money and identities.
If the I.R.S. needs your attention, it starts with a notice by regular mail via the United States Postal Service in most cases.
The I.R.S. will not send unexpected messages about auditing returns, sending stimulus payments, collecting your taxes or “canceling your Social Security number.” An I.R.S. representative may call or visit when a taxpayer has an overdue bill or has other tax-related issues. But even then, written notification is typically sent first, according to the agency.

An obviously spoofed sender line is just one of many clues that this email is not from the Internal Revenue Service, which is frequently impersonated by fraudsters in Covid-relief and spring tax-filing scams.

Scam telephone calls and voice messages using spoofed agency numbers and forged I.R.S. agent identification are common. Again, the agency typically first sends a notice by mail. It does not call unexpectedly to discuss tax refunds, threaten arrest by local law enforcement or demand immediate payment in a specific form. Tax bills are paid to the U.S. Treasury and not directly to “agents” requiring funds in iTunes or Amazon gift cards, prepaid debit cards, electronic cash or wire transfer.
The Tax Scams/Consumer Alerts page on the official irs.gov site has a lengthy list of current and classic scams. And the site has a guide for verifying real I.R.S. agents and identifying legitimate debt collectors.
Donate Wisely
Opportunistic scammers are quick to take advantage of natural disasters and humanitarian crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Be leery of messages from unfamiliar organizations requesting donations by credit card or cryptocurrency — or purporting to be from refugees or members of the military. Crowdfunding campaigns should be avoided or heavily scrutinized unless you know the organizer.

If you want to donate but aren’t sure where, assessment sites like CharityWatch and Charity Navigator have guides for where your contribution can help the most. The Opinion section of The New York Times has suggestions for humanitarian aid in Ukraine — including Direct Relief, Mercy Corps, International Medical Corps and Save the Children.
And when you do find a preferred charity’s site, check the URL carefully. Scammers use “typosquatting” (registering a purposely misspelled domain name close to a legitimate site’s address) in the hope that bad typists will inadvertently land on their malicious pages.
Report a Scam Attempt
If you get unsolicited email pretending to be from the I.R.S., you can report it by forwarding the message to phishing@irs.gov. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has a hotline to report tax-related fraud attempts at 800-366-4484; the department has a portal page for complaints.

Be warned, though: If you get taken in by a scam involving a Zelle money transfer, your bank may not back you up if you authorized the transaction.
Be Wary
As the Federal Trade Commission notes, the common signs of a scam usually include someone who impersonates a familiar organization and tells you there’s a problem (or, sometimes, a prize). The scammer pressures you to act immediately and demands payment in a specific way.
Most fraud attempts are easy to spot. Typo-laden messages, impersonal “official correspondence” from Gmail and Yahoo accounts, and voice mail messages left in robotic computer speech are instant red flags. Fake invoices and forged PayPal notices remain popular phishing lures.
You can avoid many phishing lures by fine-tuning your mail program’s junk filters and blocking unwanted calls and text senders. Let unknown callers go to voice mail. Wirecutter, a Times-owned site, has a guide to fighting spam calls.
Make sure your browser is set to block pop-up messages and warn about malicious sites. Don’t install apps from unknown developers, and keep antivirus software enabled on your computer. If spam gets through, don’t call the number and don’t open the attachment — it’s likely to be malware. If you have concerns about an account, open your browser and go to the company’s website, avoiding links in messages.

2022-03-31,"Chris Pine often seems too pretty, too nice, decent and, well, intelligent for his movies. He’s comfortable sharing the screen with both men and women, and can persuasively shift registers, all while letting you see him thinking, not just emoting. His range elevates action movies like “Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,” a 2014 take on the Tom Clancy property. Even so, I forgot that I’d reviewed “Jack Ryan” until I looked it up recently. Like too many of Pine’s movies, it just didn’t stick.
Multiple knowns and unknowns shape the careers of actors — the choices that they make and the good and baffling ones that are made for and despite them. For whatever reason, Pine has never taken off the way he should have. One obvious explanation is that unlike, say, Andrew Garfield or the Marvelites named Chris (Evans, Hemsworth, Pratt), Pine hasn’t slipped on a superhero suit. He did voice one of the title characters in the animated “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” but that was a collective rather than self-aggrandizing endeavor.
And while Pine has done time in the superhero world (including as Wonder Woman’s squeeze), his biggest franchise turn as a headliner has been in the uneven “Star Trek” series, in which he plays Captain Kirk. (A fourth is apparently in the works.) Pine has made Kirk his own with a deft balance of personality and character homage that holds the center even when the movies collapse around him. He has also appeared in a raft of fine and middling smaller movies. What’s missing from his résumé is more work that’s sharp and distinctive enough to rise above the gray middle, the way that his 2016 western “Hell or High Water” did.
Which brings me to Pine’s latest, “The Contractor,” a thriller that yearningly evokes the Bourne series while never approaching its level. (Pine even mentions that franchise in this movie’s production notes.) He plays James, an Army Special Forces officer recovering from a serious injury that he suffered out in the field, and that has nearly ruined one of his knees. It’s a character-defining detail (he’s vulnerable, physically and otherwise) that also works as a convenient plot device. But James’s struggles also extend to the home front: Like many American families, his is badly in debt and the bills keep coming.
“The Contractor” has some serious things on its mind, notably James’s crisis of faith about service, nation and his military father’s legacy. The first hour or so sets up his situation steadily with introductions and explanations, along with a dramatic jolt that sets the narrative on its course: As he hobbles toward recovery, with bills spread out on the kitchen table, James is booted out of the Army without a pension for taking unsanctioned meds. He’s still a good guy, the story assures you, though it whiffs on assigning who’s to blame for his dire straits: him, his superior, the military or the bitter dregs of what’s still called the American dream?
All these earnest sensitivities fade for a time once the story shifts gears, turning the movie into a tight, brutal thriller. Seeing no other option financially, with a small family to support — Gillian Jacobs does what she can with the rote wife role — James signs on with a private military firm. The energy picks up with the entrance of Ben Foster (Pine’s co-star in “Hell or High Water”), a former Army buddy who works for the outfit and now owns a big house and truck. The casting of Kiefer Sutherland as the company’s owner is a nice touch, mostly because you know that there’s a whole lot of serious trouble coming James’s way.

2022-04-01,"It was a union organizing campaign that few expected to have a chance. A handful of employees at Amazon’s massive warehouse on Staten Island, operating without support from national labor organizations, took on one of the most powerful companies in the world.
And, somehow, they won.
Workers at the facility voted by a wide margin to form a union, according to results released on Friday, in one of the biggest victories for organized labor in a generation.
Employees cast 2,654 votes to be represented by Amazon Labor Union and 2,131 against, giving the union a win by more than 10 percentage points, according to the National Labor Relations Board. More than 8,300 workers at the warehouse, which is the only Amazon fulfillment center in New York City, were eligible to vote.
The win on Staten Island comes at a perilous moment for labor unions in the United States, which saw the portion of workers in unions drop last year to 10.3 percent, the lowest rate in decades, despite high demand for workers, pockets of successful labor activity and rising public approval.

Critics — including some labor officials — say that traditional unions haven’t spent enough money or shown enough imagination in organizing campaigns and that they have often bet on the wrong fights. Some point to tawdry corruption scandals.
The union victory at Amazon, the first at the company in the United States after years of worker activism there, offers an enormous opportunity to change that trajectory and build on recent wins. Many union leaders regard Amazon as an existential threat to labor standards because it touches so many industries and frequently dominates them.

But the win by a little-known, independent union with few ties to existing groups appears to raise as many questions for the labor movement as it answers: not least, whether there is something fundamentally broken with the traditional bureaucratic union model that can be solved only by replacing it with grass-roots organizations like the one on Staten Island.
Amazon is likely to aggressively contest the union’s win. An unsigned statement on its corporate blog said, “We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees.”

The Staten Island outcome followed what appears likely to be a narrow loss by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union at a large Amazon warehouse in Alabama. The vote is close enough that the results will not be known for several weeks as contested ballots are litigated.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
The surprising strength shown by unions in both locations most likely means that Amazon will face years of pressure at other company facilities from labor groups and progressive activists working with them. As a recent string of union victories at Starbucks have shown, wins at one location can provide encouragement at others.
Amazon hired voraciously over the past two years and now has 1.6 million employees globally. But it has been plagued by high turnover, and the pandemic gave employees a growing sense of power while fueling worries about workplace safety. The Staten Island warehouse, known as JFK8, was the subject of a New York Times investigation last year, which found that it was emblematic of the stresses — including inadvertent firings and sky-high attrition — on workers caused by Amazon’s employment model.
“The pandemic has fundamentally changed the labor landscape” by giving workers more leverage with their employers, said John Logan, a professor of labor studies at San Francisco State University. “It’s just a question of whether unions can take advantage of the opportunity that transformation has opened up.”

Amazon said it was evaluating its options, including potentially filing an objection to “inappropriate and undue influence” by the N.L.R.B. for suing Amazon in federal court last month.
In that case, the N.L.R.B. asked a judge to force Amazon to swiftly rectify “flagrant unfair labor practices” it said took place when Amazon fired a worker who became involved with the union. Amazon argued in court that the labor board abandoned “the neutrality of their office” by filing the injunction just before the election.
Amazon would need to prove that any claims of undue influence undermined the so-called laboratory conditions necessary for a fair election, said Wilma B. Liebman, the chair of the N.L.R.B. under President Barack Obama.
President Biden was “glad to see workers ensure their voices are heard” at the Amazon facility, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters. “He believes firmly that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to join a union,” she said.

The near-term question facing the labor movement and other progressive groups is the extent to which they will help the upstart Amazon Labor Union withstand potential challenges to the result and negotiate a first contract, such as by providing resources and legal talent.
“The company will appeal, drag it out — it’s going to be an ongoing fight,” said Gene Bruskin, a longtime organizer who helped notch one of labor’s last victories on this scale, at a Smithfield meat-processing plant in 2008, and has informally advised the Staten Island workers. “The labor movement has to figure out how to support them.”
Sean O’Brien, the new president of the 1.3 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said in an interview on Thursday that the union was prepared to spend hundreds of millions of dollars unionizing Amazon and to collaborate with a variety of other unions and progressive groups.
“We’ve got a lot of partners in labor,” Mr. O’Brien said. “We’ve got community groups. It’s going to be a large coalition.”

A culture of fear created by intense productivity monitoring that was documented by The Times at JFK8 has been a key motivator for the unionization drive, which started in earnest almost a year ago. The Amazon facility offered a lifeline to laid-off workers during the pandemic but burned through staff and had such poor communication and technology that workers inadvertently were fired or lost benefits.
For some employees, the stress of working at the warehouse during Covid outbreaks was a radicalizing experience that led them to take action. Mr. Smalls, the president of the Amazon Labor Union, said he became alarmed in March 2020 after encountering a co-worker who was clearly ill. He pleaded with management to close the facility for two weeks. The company fired him after he helped lead a walkout over safety conditions in late March that year.
Amazon said at the time that it had taken “extreme measures” to keep workers safe, including deep cleaning and social distancing. It said it had fired Mr. Smalls for violating social distancing guidelines and attending the walkout even though he had been placed in a quarantine.
After workers at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., overwhelmingly rejected the retail workers union in its first election last spring, Mr. Smalls and Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee who is his friend, decided to form a new union, called Amazon Labor Union.
While the organizing in Alabama included high-profile tactics, with progressive supporters like Senator Bernie Sanders visiting the area, the organizers at JFK8 benefited from being insiders.

For months, they set up shop at the bus stop outside the warehouse, grilling meat at barbecues and at one point even passing out pot.  (The retail workers said they were hamstrung by Covid during their initial election in Alabama.)
They also filed numerous unfair-labor-practice charges with the N.L.R.B. when they believed Amazon had infringed on their rights. The labor agency found merit in several of the cases, some of which Amazon settled in a nationwide agreement to allow workers more access to organize on-site.
At times the Amazon Labor Union stumbled. The labor board determined this fall that the fledgling union, which spent months collecting signatures from workers requesting a vote, had not demonstrated sufficient support to warrant an election. But the organizers kept trying, and by late January they had finally gathered enough signatures.
Amazon played up its minimum wage of $15 an hour in advertising and other public relations efforts. The company also waged a full-throated campaign against the union, texting employees and mandating attendance at anti-union meetings. It spent $4.3 million on anti-union consultants nationwide last year, according to annual disclosures filed on Thursday with the Labor Department.
In February, Mr. Smalls was arrested at the facility after managers said he was trespassing while delivering food to co-workers and called the police. Two current employees were also arrested during the incident, which appeared to galvanize interest in the union.

The difference in outcomes in Bessemer and Staten Island may reflect a difference in receptiveness toward unions in the two states — roughly 6 percent of workers in Alabama are union members, versus 22 percent in New York — as well as the difference between a mail-in election and one conducted in person.
But it may also suggest the advantages of organizing through an independent, worker-led union. In Alabama, union officials and professional organizers were still barred from the facility under the settlement with the labor board. But at the Staten Island site, a larger portion of the union leadership and organizers were current employees.
“What we were trying to say all along is that having workers on the inside is the most powerful tool,” said Mr. Palmer, who makes $21.50 an hour. “People didn’t believe it, but you can’t beat workers organizing other workers.”
The independence of the Amazon Labor Union also appeared to undermine Amazon’s anti-union talking points, which cast the union as an interloping “third party.”
On March 25, workers at JFK8 started lining up outside a tent in the parking lot to vote. And over five voting days, they cast their ballots to form what could become the first union at Amazon’s operations in the United States.

For the past few months, I’ve been completing one book per week as part of a reading challenge that is proving rigorous but delightful. I’ve recaptured some of the uncomplicated joy of reading I remember from childhood, when books were home base, a place I was always trying to get back to. When I’d reread a book just to spend more time with its characters.
I had this experience with Torrey Peters’s “Detransition, Baby,” which won the PEN/Hemingway Award in February. I first read the book last winter, but I found myself wondering recently about one of its characters, Reese, a transgender woman trying to decide whether she wants to start a family with her ex and her ex’s new girlfriend. I had the inclination to text Reese, as if she were a friend I hadn’t checked in on in a while.
I never tire of hearing about artists’ inspirations, or getting recommendations from creative people whose work I love. So I asked Peters about the culture that’s exciting her lately. I reached her by phone at home in Brooklyn, where she’s recently returned from a winter in Colombia before departing for book tours in the U.S. and Europe this spring.
Scandinavian literature
“I’m obsessed with this book ‘Independent People,’ by Halldor Laxness,” Peters told me. The 1930s novel explores the life an Icelandic sheep farmer. “You start out reading about the sheep farmer and you think it’s the most boring book in the world,” Peters said. But it grew on her. She was especially taken by Laxness’s warmth for his characters and the affectionate way that he pokes fun at them.
To appreciate “the warmth and humor and ridiculousness” of the book “requires a kind of focus that I think is out of vogue,” Peters said.
She finds Laxness and the demands he puts on readers inspiring for her own work. “I spend a lot of time thinking, ‘How can I do the Halldor Laxness thing, but how can I do it for people who are on Twitter all day? Who grew up watching Tarantino?’”

Waking early
Peters gets up at 5:30 a.m. and reads by candlelight; on a good day, she might read for two hours. Then she’ll put on the computer scientist and writer Cal Newport’s podcast, “Deep Questions.” “It’s sort of like having a work coach just mildly exhorting you in the background,” she said.
When it’s warm, she heads to the waterfront to watch the sun. Because of how her Brooklyn neighborhood is situated, Peters said, she can’t see it rise directly. “But you can watch the sunrise in the reflections of the buildings, and it’s almost more beautiful than sunrise,” she said. “It’s like watching the sunrise in a fractured mirror.”
Seeking flaky pastry
Peters is a connoisseur of croissants and has strong opinions about fillings. “I’m very anti-pistachio in croissants,” she said. “But if you’re just totally reinventing the croissant and putting halloumi in it, I’ll go with that.”

What’s next
In an email after we spoke, Peters wrote that she’s looking forward to reading “Bad Girls,” the English translation of a novel by the Argentine writer Camila Sosa Villada, which will be published in May. The book is about a group of trans sex workers who find and adopt an abandoned baby, “which seems like a counterpoint to ‘Detransition, Baby’ in some ways,” she wrote.

Reports of Russian atrocities
As Russian forces retreat from Kyiv, they are leaving horror in their wake: Videos and images show the bodies of civilians lying in the streets. Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of executing civilians.
Western officials condemned the reports of atrocities on Sunday, redoubling calls for war crimes investigations. A leading rights group said it had documented “apparent war crimes.” Here are live updates.
The outrage could move the needle on the E.U.’s refusal to impose sanctions on Russian oil and gas: Germany’s defense minister said that in light of the Bucha atrocities, the bloc should consider banning Russian gas imports, as Lithuania did on Saturday. Europe’s ongoing energy purchases send as much as $850 million each day into Russia’s coffers.
Details: The images from Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, showed corpses with hands bound behind their backs. (Russia’s Defense Ministry dismissed the photos as “fake” but acknowledged the pullback.) Residents of another formerly occupied town, Trostyanets, also described weeks of hunger and horror.

Resistance: Here’s how Kyiv has withstood Russian attacks and how already legendary fighters repelled Russians from the small garrison city of Vasylkiv.
Background: Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has repeatedly tried — and failed — to subjugate Ukraine.
Ripple effects: The war has driven up the cost of food in East Africa, which is facing what could be its worst drought in four decades.
State of the War:
Russian forces continued to batter Ukraine’s southern coastline.
The U.S. said that Russia is running its military campaign out of Moscow because it has no battlefield commander.
Ukraine said it was back in control of dozens of towns near Kyiv.
Other developments:
The war cast a shadow over the weekend’s presidential elections in Serbia and Hungary, where Europe’s two most Kremlin-friendly leaders appeared ready to win re-election.

Pakistan’s Parliament dissolved
Prime Minister Imran Khan dissolved Pakistan’s National Assembly and called for new elections on Sunday, blocking a no-confidence vote that was widely expected to remove him from office.
The move — a defiant bid by Khan to remain in power, despite losing the backing of the military — threatens to plunge the country into a constitutional crisis. On Saturday, Khan said he would not accept the result of the vote, dismissing it as part of an American conspiracy against him.
Opposition leaders accused Khan of high treason and asked the country’s Supreme Court to intervene, calling it “unprecedented” and a “blatant violation” of Pakistan’s Constitution. A hearing was scheduled for Monday.

Analysis: The maneuver risked destabilizing the fragile democracy in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation that supports the Taliban. Since Pakistan became an independent country in 1947, not one of its prime ministers has completed a full term.
Profile: Khan, a former cricket star, was elected in 2018 on a nationalist promise to fight corruption and distance Pakistan from the U.S., with which it has had a troubled history. If Khan is ousted, many experts say that Pakistan could grow closer to the U.S. and the West.

Taliban outlaws poppy growing
The insurgents turned rulers of Afghanistan outlawed the cultivation of opium flowers on Sunday. The decree also banned the use, sale, transfer, purchase, import and export of wine as well as heroin and other drugs.
The move will have far-reaching consequences for the many farmers who turned to the illicit crop amid the nation’s brutal drought and economic crisis.
Many farmers had planted the crop — which can be stored for some time after harvesting — as an investment. They anticipated dwindling supply and rising prices, though they knew the Taliban could move to restrict cultivation. The Taliban’s announcement on Sunday came during the poppy harvest.

Context: Afghanistan accounts for about 80 percent of the world’s supply of opium.
Background: In the 1990s, the Taliban made several halfhearted attempts to restrict opium before enacting a ban on the cultivation of opium poppies shortly before the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001, after which the Taliban turned to the crop to fuel their war machine for two decades.

ARTS AND IDEAS
A microplastics storm
As long as there has been marine life, there has been marine snow — a ceaseless drizzle of death and waste sinking from the surface of the sea into its depths.
Now, tiny bits of plastic have infiltrated the slow-descending flakes, which are the deep sea’s main food source and a pipeline that carries the ocean’s carbon to the seafloor. The microplastics, normally buoyant, sink with the flakes.
That’s new information: Scientists had originally assumed that plastic mostly floated on the surface. But a recent model found that 99.8 percent of the plastic that entered the ocean after 1950 sank below the first few hundred feet. Scientists have found 10,000 times more microplastics on the seafloor than in contaminated surface waters.
They are just beginning to understand the consequences. Because microplastics add to the surface area of marine snow, the mixture could carry more carbon to the seafloor and alter our planet’s ancient cooling process.
Sinking microplastics may also damage deep-sea food webs. “The plastics are a diet pill for these animals,” a carbon cycle scientist told The Times.

2022-04-04,"Nations need to move away much faster from fossil fuels to retain any hope of preventing a perilous future on an overheated planet, according to a major new report on climate change released on Monday, although they have made some progress because of the falling costs of clean energy.
The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body of experts convened by the United Nations, warns that unless countries drastically accelerate efforts over the next few years to slash their emissions from coal, oil and natural gas, the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, will likely be out of reach by the end of this decade.
That’s the threshold beyond which scientists say the dangers of global warming — including worsening floods, droughts, wildfires and ecosystem collapse — grow considerably. Humans have already heated the planet by an average of 1.1 degrees Celsius since the 19th century, largely by burning fossil fuels for energy.
But the task is daunting: Holding warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius would require nations to collectively reduce their planet-warming emissions roughly 43 percent by 2030 and to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere altogether by the early 2050s, the report found. By contrast, current policies by governments are only expected to reduce global emissions by a few percentage points this decade. Last year, fossil fuel emissions worldwide rebounded to near-record highs after a brief dip as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is a climate emergency,” said United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, adding that wealthy economies and corporations “are not just turning a blind eye; they are adding fuel to the flames. They are choking our planet, based on their vested interests and historic investments in fossil fuels, when cheaper, renewable solutions provide green jobs, energy security and greater price stability.”
The report, which was approved by 195 governments and lays out strategies that countries could pursue to halt global warming, comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused oil and gas prices to skyrocket, diverting political attention from climate change. In the United States and Europe, leaders are focused on shoring up domestic fossil fuel supplies to avoid price spikes and energy shortages, even if that means higher short term emissions.
Yet climate scientists say there is little margin for delay if the world wants to hold global warming to relatively tolerable levels.
“Every year that you let pass without going for these urgent emissions reductions makes it more and more difficult,” said Jim Skea, an energy researcher at Imperial College London who helped lead the report, which was compiled by 278 experts from 65 countries. “Unless we really do it immediately, it will not be possible to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But even if that goal becomes unattainable, scientists said, it will still be worthwhile for countries to slash emissions as quickly as possible to prevent as much warming as they can. Every additional rise in global temperatures increases the perils that people face around the world, such as water scarcity, malnutrition and life-threatening heat waves, the U.N. panel has found.
“Every fraction of a degree matters,” Dr. Skea said. “Even if we go beyond 1.5, that doesn’t mean we throw up our hands and despair.”
Scientists say that global warming will largely halt once humans stop adding heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, a concept known as “net zero” emissions.

The new report contains glimmers of optimism. Over the past decade, many nations have adopted ambitious climate policies, scaled back plans for new coal plants and used subsidies and regulations to expand renewable energy. Although emissions from fossil fuels are still growing worldwide, the rate of growth slowed in the 2010s, compared with the 2000s, the report said, and humanity now has a much better shot at avoiding some of the worst-case global warming scenarios once widely feared by scientists.

Clean energy technology has advanced far more quickly than expected, the report said. Since 2010, the costs of solar panels and lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles have plunged by 85 percent, while the cost of wind turbines has fallen by more than half.
Rapidly shifting away from the fossil fuels that have underpinned economies for more than a century will require nations to do much more, however. Over the next decade, governments and companies would need to invest three to six times the roughly $600 billion they currently spend annually on encouraging clean energy and cutting emissions, the report said.
But the cost of inaction is also substantial, in terms of deaths, displacement and damage. In the United States last year, damages from floods, wildfires, drought and other disasters related to weather and climate totaled approximately $145 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency said that “extremely high” levels of disasters were becoming “the new normal.”
“Reducing emissions substantially is much less painful than you would think, and probably beneficial in the short term,” said Glen Peters of the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, who contributed to the report.

The new report examines dozens of strategies proposed by scientists and energy experts to help nations make the transition.
First, countries would need to clean up virtually all power plants worldwide that generate electricity for homes and factories. That means relying more on wind, solar, nuclear, geothermal or hydropower. Most of the world’s coal and natural gas plants would either need to shut down or install carbon capture technology that can trap emissions and bury them underground. Such technology has been slow to take off because of its high costs.
The next step would be to reconfigure transportation, industry and other segments of the global economy to run on clean electricity rather than fossil fuels. Cars powered by gasoline could be replaced with electric vehicles charged by low-carbon grids. Gas-burning furnaces in homes could be swapped out for electric heat pumps. Instead of burning coal, steel mills could shift to electric furnaces that melt scrap.
At the same time, nations could take steps to reduce their total energy demand. That could entail expanding public transit, upgrading insulation so homes consume less energy, recycling more raw materials and making factories more energy efficient. At the high end, such demand-side policies could help cut emissions in key sectors as much as 40 to 70 percent by 2050, the report notes.
But many economic activities can’t be easily electrified. Batteries are still too heavy for most airplanes. Many industries, like cement and glass, require extreme heat and currently burn coal or gas. For those emissions, governments and businesses will have to develop new fuels and industrial processes, the report said.

Countries will also need to address emissions from deforestation and agriculture, which account for around a fifth of global greenhouse gases. That means dealing with issues like global meat production, which emits methane and carbon dioxide, and is causing rampant deforestation in vital places like the Amazon rainforest.
Forests and wetlands naturally store carbon dioxide, which makes sparing them from destruction a highly effective and economical way to mitigate warming, said Stephanie Roe, a World Wildlife Fund scientist who helped write the report. “I can’t reiterate enough the importance of conserving those ecosystems,” she said.
Even in the best case, humanity is unlikely to eliminate all of its planet warming emissions, the report warned. So countries will likely also have to devise ways to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by around midcentury. One strategy could be to plant more trees, although that may not be enough, the report cautioned. Other options include devices that suck carbon out of the air, though these technologies are still immature.

The report acknowledges the enormous challenges ahead. Winding down coal, oil and gas projects would mean job losses and financial dislocation. Some climate solutions come with major trade-offs: Protecting forests, for instance, leaves less land for growing crops or raising livestock to feed a world population that keeps growing.
And some of the biggest obstacles to climate action are political, not technological. The report notes that “incumbent fossil fuel interests” often work to thwart policies to cut emissions. Organized disinformation campaigns by climate change deniers have, in some places, increased political polarization over the issue. And politicians tend to avoid difficult decisions if the benefits are not felt beyond the current election cycle.
In the developing world, governments still need to expand access to electricity and modern cooking fuels for hundreds of millions of the poorest people, which might only be possible in the short term by burning more fossil fuels. These nations have benefited from advances in renewable energy technology, but efforts to cut emissions deeply have run up against two longstanding issues: high costs and overstretched governments.
“If technology could solve the problem completely, the problem could have been solved two or three decades ago,” said Wei Shen, a researcher at the Institute of Development Studies, a think tank in Britain, who helped write the report.
There is strong political will in many developing nations to tackle climate change, said Fatima Denton, director of the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa and another author of the report. But greater financial support from wealthy nations is critical, she said, partly as a matter of fairness and historical responsibility: Western countries that got rich by burning fossil fuels are now effectively telling poor nations that they cannot do the same.

“You’re telling them to leave their resources in the ground, when they have always more or less seen these as the route to more capitalism, more wealth, more prosperity,” Dr. Denton said.
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said last year that his country would stop building new coal plants overseas, a major step toward promoting green energy in the developing world. At home, though, China is digging up and burning more coal to keep electricity flowing amid the economic disruptions of the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic. China is the planet’s top emitter of greenhouse gases.

“It’s unfortunate: These recent crises just demonstrate that if decarbonization happened earlier, then China, as well as other regions, would have been more resilient to some of these shocks,” said Cecilia Han Springer, a China expert at Boston University. “But that means there’s also an opportunity to double down.”
India’s government has increased energy efficiency in homes and factories, given farmers solar-powered water pumps and helped promote the rapid construction of solar farms. But the country’s state-run electric utilities remain in fragile fiscal health, meaning there is no guarantee that efforts to expand clean energy will be financially sustainable.

In remarks Monday, Mr. Guterres urged people around the world to press for action. “If you live in a big city, a rural area, or a small island state, if you invest in the stock market, if you care about justice, and our children’s future, I am appealing directly to you,” he said. “Demand that renewable energy is introduced now — at speed and at scale.

2022-04-05,"AMIENS, France — During the last presidential campaign, the troubled Whirlpool factory in the northern city of Amiens became the setting for frantic, dueling appeals for support by Emmanuel Macron and his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen.
Mr. Macron promised to save the plant — which happens to be in his hometown — and once he was elected, his government poured millions in subsidies toward the factory’s reinvention, as a showpiece of his commitment to reviving French industry.
As Mr. Macron seeks re-election, he and Ms. Le Pen are preparing to square off once again as the front-runners before the first round of voting in presidential elections on Sunday. But the fate of the plant has proved much the opposite of what Mr. Macron had hoped for.
Today, the plant is an example of the difficulty of rehabilitating ailing French industries and of the president’s challenge in winning the confidence of French workers, who have been gravitating for years to the far right.

The mammoth plant in Amiens, where weeds have pushed through asphalt and the cafeteria’s menu is frozen on sausage fricassee, is deserted and lifeless, except for three last Whirlpool workers who spend their days huddling around the coffee machines in a few small rooms.
The plant’s new operator was convicted in February of misuse of funds, after a year of taking money from the government and Whirlpool and doing precious little with it. Workers say they spent idle days as next to nothing rolled off the assembly line. Instead, they kept busy killing time, taking extended cigarette breaks or lying inside their cars fidgeting on their smartphones.

“Two or three times, when someone important visited, we had to pretend to work or hide,” recalled Mariano Munoz, 49, who was in charge of janitorial services. “The welders welded all sorts of things and hammered away. One or two tinkered with a car. Me, I’d take the street cleaner and I’d sweep the entire parking lot.”
Mr. Macron was elected as a change agent five years ago, with plans to disrupt the heavily unionized industrial sector that had stagnated as owners feared the rising cost of French workers who were guaranteed years of ample benefits and were notoriously difficult to fire. For years, unemployment hovered chronically at 8 percent or more as the industrial sector atrophied.

Initially, Mr. Macron attempted to overhaul France’s economy by pushing through business-friendly changes, like cutting taxes, especially for the wealthy. In his first years as president, he took on some of France’s toughest unions, provoking the biggest strikes the country had seen in years as he revamped France’s voluminous labor code, making it easier to hire and fire workers.
But even as the overall economy has bounced back strongly from the pandemic, Mr. Macron’s efforts to reindustrialize France have proved decidedly mixed, economists say, as evidenced by the nation’s trade deficit of 84.7 billion euros, about $93 billion, last year — a record — as well as the plant in Amiens, which had made tumble dryers for Whirlpool and did not survive despite nearly €10 million in subsidies.

For Mr. Macron, the plant’s long, agonizing death has complicated every trip back to his hometown, about 80 miles north of Paris. It reinforced the impression of Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, as the president of the rich, someone cut off from ordinary French people — like the nearly 300 workers who lost their jobs when the plant finally did close in 2018.
Many of the laid off workers went on to join the Yellow Vest movement, whose ranks were filled with working-class French struggling under high taxes and a lack of earning power, ushering in the biggest political crisis of Mr. Macron’s presidency.

Burned by the Yellow Vest protests, Mr. Macron’s government spent massively to offset the economic shock of the pandemic, and unemployment is now at its lowest in a decade. Still, it is service-sector jobs that have continued to increase, while industrial employment declines.
Thomas Grjebine, an economist at CEPII, a research center in Paris, said that the fate of the Amiens plant was “symptomatic” of the difficulties of reviving the industrial sector. “In fact, the government is somewhat powerless before the closings of plants,” Mr. Grjebine said. “But many promises are made during campaigns.”
During Mr. Macron’s campaign for the presidency in 2017, 11 days before the final vote, Mr. Macron met with union leaders in town, while Ms. Le Pen paid a surprise visit to the plant’s parking lot and was greeted warmly by striking employees — forcing a reluctant Mr. Macron to follow.

Heckled and jostled by the hostile crowd, Mr. Macron tried to catch up with Ms. Le Pen, whose party, then called the National Front, had won the department that includes Amiens in the first round of voting that year.

“You think it doesn’t hurt me in the gut that people vote for the National Front on my soil?” Mr. Macron said to the crowd. Later, he promised a “real Marshall Plan for the reindustrialization of our economically lost territories.”
Half a year after his election victory, that promise seemed in sight. A prominent local businessman, Nicolas Decayeux, was selected to take over the plant with a project to manufacture refrigerated lockers and small vehicles. He took on 162 of the 282 laid-off Whirlpool workers and received €2.6 million in subsidies from the government and €7.4 million from Whirlpool.
During a celebratory visit to the plant, Mr. Macron was accompanied by Mr. Decayeux. In a follow-up letter to Mr. Decayeux, the president wrote that the businessman’s “beautiful entrepreneurial project” would “contribute to our industrial recovery.”
“I really had stars in my eyes because here is a young president who wants to reform France,” recalled Mr. Decayeux, who named his company WN.
It was a rare piece of good news for Amiens, a picturesque town of more than 130,000 that straddles the Somme River.

Like much of northern France, it had been hit by deindustrialization for two generations as successive national governments considered a shift toward a consumer-driven economy a sign of modernization, witnessed in the Amazon warehouses that have opened in Amiens and elsewhere.

“This drop in social standing, the sentiment of being abandoned and of not mattering, eased the way for extremism,” said Brigitte Fouré, the center-right mayor of Amiens.
In an interview with a French magazine last year, Mr. Macron said that growing up in Amiens, he had witnessed the “full force of deindustrialization” in his region. Still, he acknowledged that he himself had enjoyed a sheltered upbringing, living in a “rather happy bubble, and even a bubble in a bubble.”
The son of two medical doctors, Mr. Macron grew up in Amiens’s richest neighborhood, Henriville, and attended the city’s most prestigious school, a private Jesuit establishment called La Providence.

“He’s from Henriville, and when you say, ‘Henriville,’ it’s Versailles,” said M’hammed El Hiba, the longtime head of Alco, a community center in Amiens North, an area inhabited by the descendants of North Africans recruited to work in factories in the 1960s and 1970s.

At the former Whirlpool plant, the optimism faded quickly. Former workers said that Mr. Decayeux’s plans to build lockers and small vehicles never took off.
“Nothing was happening,” said Christophe Beaugrand, 44, a welder who was hired by Mr. Decayeux after being laid off by Whirlpool. “People were in the cafeteria with their phones and chargers. When the prefect visited, we had to make noise or hide.”
Worried about the lack of activity, workers informed their national lawmaker, François Ruffin, and gave him a chicken made of steel as proof of their idleness.

Mr. Ruffin said he alerted the government but got no response until it was too late. Mr. Macron’s government, he said, appeared to have lost interest in the plant after Mr. Decayeux’s company took it over.
“It was as if everything was over on the day of the inauguration,” Mr. Ruffin said.

Eventually, the government looked closely at Mr. Decayeux’s company, WN, and pulled the plug. Without subsidies, the company shut down in July 2019, about a year after opening to great fanfare.
After an official inquiry and a trial, Mr. Decayeux was found guilty in February of awarding himself a €25,000 bonus, which he must repay; of using company funds to rent two apartments, one for himself and another for his girlfriend; and of hiring his son as a part-time sales representative.
Mr. Decayeux, who has appealed, said that he had become a scapegoat for a government that panicked and fatally cut subsidies before his business could take off. Though he acknowledged that the assembly line lay silent for most of the time, he said that WN had made 15 small vehicles and a few elevator shafts.

“Before the government, I’m nothing,” he said, adding, “They crushed me.”
During his last visit to Amiens, in November, Mr. Macron met nine former Whirlpool workers. By then, the news had become even worse. A local furniture maker that had taken over the plant following WN’s collapse had also quickly gone out of business.

Mr. Macron described Mr. Decayeux as a “hunter of bonuses” and told the workers, “I was duped along with you.”
Some of Whirlpool’s former workers didn’t buy it.
“It’s all well and good that he did his mea culpa, but behind that, there are still people without jobs,” said Frédéric Chantrelle, 53, one of the last three Whirlpool workers still employed at the plant. A court ruled last year that the company had to rehire them because the factory was not closed for economic reasons.
In the otherwise abandoned 17-hectare facility, they punch in and walk through a labyrinth of dark and cold corridors to reach the few heated rooms where they spend their days.

Despite its strict gun laws, California is by no means spared from the pains of gun violence.
In 2022, the state has already experienced 13 mass shootings, defined as a single event in which at least four people were shot, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive.
The deadliest of these came over the weekend, when six people were killed and a dozen wounded in a crowded late-night strip of downtown Sacramento. The tragedy has fueled a push to further clamp down on guns in California.
“We’re standing right outside our great Capitol building, just blocks away from the horrific scene of the worst mass shooting in Sacramento history,” State Senator Robert Hertzberg said in a news briefing Tuesday afternoon. “The alarm bells are blazing. We could not have a clearer call for action on gun violence.”
The Sacramento shooting has shined a light on an epidemic of illegal guns in California. The first weapon recovered had been stolen and converted to being capable of automatic gunfire, The Associated Press reported. In another shooting in Sacramento this year, a man used an unregistered assault weapon to kill his three daughters and then himself.

On Tuesday, Hertzberg and his colleagues promoted a package of bills aimed at reducing gun violence, including one that would make it easier for people to sue gun companies for liability in shootings. Other measures would tighten restrictions on unregistered firearms and marketing guns to minors.
Arguably the most controversial of these proposals called for by Gov. Gavin Newsom is modeled after a Texas abortion ban that allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman get an abortion.

California’s proposal, S.B. 1327, would offer $10,000 bounties to encourage lawsuits from private citizens against anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, .50-caliber rifles, ghost guns or ghost gun kits. (If you’re unfamiliar with ghost guns, I recommend this Times article on the recent proliferation of these untraceable, homemade firearms.)
Hertzberg, the bill’s lead author, said he opposed the Texas law, which he said had been “horribly upheld” by the Supreme Court. But, he added, “every gun that we can take off of the street — if that’s a ghost gun or an assault weapon — through any creative means, to me is a good thing.”

The announcement comes as new research reveals the dangers of having a gun in the home in California.

After the Sacramento shooting, President Biden called for movement on federal gun legislation. He pleaded with Congress to ban ghost guns, require background checks for all gun sales, and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
“We must do more than mourn; we must act,” Biden said in a statement.

“Though a mere 11 miles north of San Francisco at the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, the quaintly seductive hillside village of Sausalito feels as though it is thousands of miles away from the city.
Strolling with someone you love along Sausalito’s waterfront, which radiates a vibe reminiscent of Italy’s Amalfi Coast, is the stuff of which lifelong memories are made. The town’s eclectic mix of restaurants, shopping and inns, punctuated by some of the most attractive scenery on the West Coast, makes time spent in Sausalito wholly satisfying.
To travel to San Francisco and fail to make that short drive across the bridge to visit Sausalito is to miss out on one of the most charming experiences California has to offer.”

2022-04-07,"The new director of the Census Bureau, Robert L. Santos, has his work cut out for him. He took office in January on the heels of a 2020 census hobbled by a pandemic, natural disasters and political interference by the Trump administration.
The census proved accurate enough in the end to be used to reapportion the House of Representatives and guide the drawing of new political maps nationwide. But it also undercounted Black and Latino people — and overcounted white and Asian people — to an alarming degree. Those flaws resonate with Mr. Santos, a Latino who is the first person of color to hold the top Census Bureau post.
His task is not just to rebuild battered public trust in the census, but to prepare for a 2030 count that could rely on government data and even private data from internet giants like Amazon to achieve a more accurate count.
Mr. Santos is a statistician with more than four decades of experience in corporate, nonprofit and government posts, most recently at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes social and economic policies. In a recent question-and-answer session, edited for length and clarity, he talked about those challenges.
When you were at the Urban Institute you were openly worried that some of the problems the 2020 census faced, from the pandemic to political interference, might threaten the integrity of the count. Now that it’s over, how would you grade it?
I would say — and I’m really proud of this — that this Census Bureau completed the job that it intended to do for the 2020 census, and it provided a quality product for the overall population. The apportionment counts and the redistricting counts were absolutely fit for use. They’re quality products. We stand by them.

2022-04-08,"On Friday, a retired NASA astronaut and three paying customers set off on a journey to the International Space Station.
The mission is the first to go to the space station on which all of the passengers are private citizens, and it is the first time that NASA has collaborated in arranging a space tourism visit. The flight marked a pivotal moment in efforts to spur space travel by commercial enterprises, NASA officials said.
“This is a really, really big milestone for us in our overall campaign to try to help foster a commercial low-Earth-orbit economy,” Dana Weigel, the deputy program manager for the space station at NASA, said during a news conference after the launch.
But the mission also highlighted that most of the customers for trips to orbit will be the very wealthy in the near-term. Axiom Space of Houston acted as the tour operator, selling seats for the 10-day trip, including eight days aboard the station, for $55 million each. Axiom hired SpaceX to provide the transportation — a Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon capsule, the same system that takes NASA astronauts to and from the station.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
At 11:17 a.m. Eastern time, the mission, called Axiom-1, lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida into clear blue skies following a smooth countdown.
“Welcome to space,” a SpaceX official said to the Axiom-1 crew soon after the capsule detached from the second stage of the rocket. “Thanks for flying Falcon 9. You guys enjoy your trip to that wonderful space station in the sky.”
The customers on the Axiom-1 mission are Larry Connor, managing partner of the Connor Group, a firm in Dayton, Ohio, that owns and operates luxury apartments; Mark Pathy, chief executive of Mavrik Corporation, a Canadian investment company; and Eytan Stibbe, an investor and former Israeli Air Force pilot.
They will be led to the space station by Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut who is now a vice president at Axiom and the Ax-1 mission’s commander.

“What a ride!” Mr. López-Alegría reported on Twitter from orbit.
They are scheduled to dock at the space station early Saturday.
Although the Kennedy Space Center is part of NASA, NASA had almost no role in the launch or the orbital ride. The agency’s officials were happy about that as they look to a future when they can simply buy services like room aboard a space station from commercial vendors.

The International Space Station, about as long as a football field, is a technological marvel, but one that costs NASA about $1.3 billion a year to operate. Although NASA wants to extend the lifetime of the current station to 2030, it hopes that much less expensive commercial space stations are in orbit by then.
For NASA, that means learning how to collaborate with private enterprise in orbit including hosting space tourists, while Axiom and other companies have to figure out how to build a profitable off-planet business.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Axiom is planning four or five such missions to the space station, and then it has an agreement with NASA to attach several modules it is building to the space station. When the International Space Station is finally retired, those modules are to be detached to form the core of an Axiom station.
“This is the first mission really in our effort to build a commercial space station,” said Michael T. Suffredini, the president and chief executive of Axiom who previously worked at NASA managing the I.S.S.
Space tourism surged last year. Blue Origin, the company founded by Jeff Bezos of Amazon, started carrying paying customers on brief suborbital trips to the edge of space. Virgin Galactic flew its founder, Richard Branson, on a short flight and began selling tickets for future flights.
In September, a SpaceX Crew Dragon launch chartered by Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur, was the first trip to orbit on which none of the passengers was a professional astronaut. For that mission, named Inspiration4, Mr. Isaacman decided to give opportunities to three people who would never have been able to afford the trip themselves. That trip did not go to the space station, and the four spent three days floating in orbit before returning to Earth.

By contrast, each of Axiom’s space travelers is paying his own way, and the experience is different. Earlier private travelers to the space station — most recently Yusaku Maezwa, a Japanese billionaire — traveled on Russian Soyuz rockets and were accompanied by professional Russian astronauts. For this flight, Axiom and SpaceX are in charge of the mission from launch until the capsule enters the vicinity of the space station.

During a news conference last month, Mr. Connor objected to being called a space tourist.
“The space tourists, they’ll spend 10 or 15 hours training, five to 10 minutes in space,” he said. “And by the way, that’s fine. In our case, depending upon our role, we’ve spent anywhere from 750 to over 1,000 hours training.”
At least in theory, this is the future that NASA has been working toward for decades.
In 1984, during the Reagan administration, the law that established NASA was amended to encourage private enterprise off Earth. But plans to privatize the operating of NASA’s space shuttles were shelved after the loss of Challenger in 1986.
Instead, it was the Soviet space program in the fading years of communism that was ahead of NASA in selling access to space. When the International Space Station opened up, Dennis Tito, an American entrepreneur, was the first Russian-hosted tourist to visit, in 2001. Russia stopped taking private travelers after 2009; with the impending retirement of the space shuttles, NASA needed to buy available seats on Russian rockets for its astronauts to get and from the space station.
In the last few years, NASA has opened up to the idea of space tourism. Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator during the Trump administration, often spoke of NASA’s being one customer out of many and of how that would greatly reduce costs for NASA.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But for NASA to be one customer of many, there have to be other customers. Eventually, other applications like pharmaceutical research or zero-gravity manufacturing may finally come to fruition.
For now, the most promising market is wealthy people who pay to visit space themselves.
While Axiom Space now declines to comment when asked how much it is charging to take people to the International Space Station, the company did provide a ticket price a few years ago: $55 million per passenger.
Much of the price is tied up in the rocket and spacecraft needed to get to orbit. And once there, customers also must pay for accommodations and amenities.
In 2019, NASA set up a price list for use of the space station by private companies. For space tourists, NASA said it would charge companies like Axiom Space $35,000 a night per person for the use of sleeping quarters and amenities, including air, water, the internet and the toilet. Last year, NASA said it was raising the prices for future trips to the station.

In some areas, the Axiom-1 crew members underwent much of the same training as NASA astronauts, especially for safety procedures and everyday living in orbit. Ms. Weigel gave the toilet as an example. They needed to learn how the space station toilets work, but, as guests, they didn’t need to train for how to repair the toilet if it malfunctioned.
When they board the space station, the Axiom visitors will receive an orientation of what to do in various emergencies and how to use facilities. “That actually looks pretty similar to what our crews do for the first day and a half,” Ms. Weigel said.
After that, the Axiom astronauts will go off and do their own activities, which include 25 scientific experiments they plan to conduct during the eight days on the space station. The experiments include medical work planned with institutions like the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and Montreal Children’s Hospital. The Axiom astronauts will also conduct some technology demonstrations like self-assembling robots that could be used to build future spacecraft in space.
The activities of the Axiom visitors are coordinated with those of the other crew members on the space station so that people are not trying to use the same facility at the same time.
“It’s more than a 1,000-piece puzzle, I’ll put it that way, to fit all that together,” Ms. Weigel said.

With a larger-than-usual number of people staying on the U.S. segment, some of the sleeping quarters are makeshift in various parts of the station. One person will be sleeping in the Crew Dragon, Ms. Weigel said.
But the Axiom passengers said they will be careful not to get in the way of other crew members.
“We’re very cognizant that we will be guests aboard the I.S.S.,” Mr. López-Alegría said last month."
2022-04-09,
2022-04-10,"LOS ANGELES — By 2018, almost every golden-age Hollywood studio had been conquered by outside forces.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had been tossed between disruptive owners for decades, never to fully recover. Columbia Pictures was sold to Coca-Cola in 1982 and then offloaded to Sony in 1989. Universal had weathered five outside takeovers in the span of 21 years. Paramount Pictures had been strip mined for cash by an ailing Sumner Redstone.
Warner Bros. alone stood as Hollywood’s citadel, a beige-walled protectorate of filmmakers run by executives with institutional Hollywood knowledge.
Then AT&T drove into town.
The Texas phone giant took over Warner Bros. in June 2018 as part of a bid to “bring a fresh approach to how the media and entertainment company works,” as Randall L. Stephenson, then AT&T’s chief executive, put it at the time. As it set about building a Netflix-style streaming service, AT&T slashed and burned through the Warner Bros. ranks and installed leaders with little Hollywood experience. They cut costs, surprised stars with abrupt distribution decisions and pushed Warner to start behaving as more of a technology company and less of an entertainment one: It’s the future!
“The telephone people had no understanding of Hollywood — and no passion for movies,” Robert A. Daly, who ran Warner Bros. in the 1980s and ’90s, said on Friday. “It’s the same mistake outsiders always make. It’s show business, show business, show business. They always forget that.”
On Friday, AT&T handed off Warner Bros. to Discovery Inc. as part of a $43 billion merger.
The 99-year-old movie studio, home to Harry Potter, Batman and Bugs Bunny, will now head in a different direction — back toward its traditional sweet spot as an entertainment company, or at least Hollywood’s newest mogul has vowed. David Zaslav, Discovery’s chief executive, will run the new corporation, which is called, with no small amount of symbolism, Warner Bros. Discovery.

1. Russia is moving thousands of troops and vehicles east for an assault on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine as civilians flee westward.
The Pentagon confirmed that Russia was sending hundreds of military vehicles, including infantry, combat-helicopter support units and artillery, to the region. New satellite images showed a long column of Russian military vehicles moving toward the Ukrainian city of Izium, which could serve as the staging ground for the offensive.
The next phase of the war will look very different from the battles fought in and around Ukrainian cities. The flatter, more open countryside of Donbas may favor Russia’s armored units and air superiority.
After meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow today, Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said he came away feeling pessimistic about peace prospects, and that Putin intended to intensify the brutality of the war.

Our journalists spent more than a week in Bucha, the once-prosperous Kyiv suburb, documenting dozens of killings of civilians, interviewing scores of witnesses and following local investigators to uncover the scale of Russian atrocities.
As the Russian advance on Kyiv stalled in the face of fierce resistance, the occupation of Bucha slid into horror. The evidence suggests the Russians killed recklessly and sometimes sadistically before they retreated.

3. President Emmanuel Macron will face the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in the runoff of France’s presidential election.
The final results of Sunday’s first round of voting gave 27.8 percent of the vote to Macron and 23.2 percent to Le Pen, who benefited from a late surge that reflected widespread disaffection over rising prices, security and immigration.
That puts the spotlight on Macron’s “dam” of mainstream voters: Those who, time and again, have put political differences aside in the second round and voted for anyone but Le Pen in a so-called “Republican front” to deny the far right the presidency.
Macron is still favored to win re-election, but by a much smaller margin than in 2017, when he last faced Le Pen. The supporters of Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leftist veteran politician who came in a strong third, could now help determine the election’s outcome on April 24.

4. Jared Kushner’s private equity firm secured a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia after leaving the White House, despite a warning that the firm’s operations were “unsatisfactory in all aspects.”
A panel that screens investments for the Saudi sovereign wealth fund objected to the Kushner deal, documents show. Days later, the full board of the $620 billion Public Investment Fund — led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler — overruled the panel.
Ethics experts say the deal creates the appearance that the investment was payback for Kushner’s advocacy for Saudi Arabia in the White House — or could be a bid for future favor if former President Trump, his father-in-law, wins another presidential term in 2024.

5. Elon Musk abruptly backed off plans to join Twitter’s board.
Musk, the world’s richest person, announced plans to join the board last week after becoming Twitter’s biggest shareholder. But he apparently pulled a U-turn over the weekend and then published a series of erratic tweets about the social media company that upset employees.
If Musk had taken the board seat, he would have been restricted from buying more than 14.9 percent of Twitter shares and would have been legally required to act in the interest of all shareholders. But no longer: In a new filing today, he said he was entitled to buy more Twitter shares and reserved the right to “change his plans at any time, as he deems appropriate.”
“I believe this is for the best,” Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief executive, said. He warned employees that “there will be distractions ahead” and advised them to “tune out the noise.”

6. Remote work has thrown the future of commuting — along with much of New York City's economy — into doubt.
PwC, Verizon and a host of other corporations are permanently changing the way they work, making the five-day-a-week trek into Manhattan feel like a relic. That has enormous consequences for New York, whose economy is especially dependent on filling its forests of office towers.
Eric Adams, the city’s mayor, and Gov. Kathy Hochul have stepped up their urgent messaging that the city’s roughly 1.3 million private-sector office workers need to return to their desks. But they may as well be shouting into the wind as society changes around them.
Adams’s first 100 days in office have been characterized by efforts to fight crime, clear the streets and subways of homeless people and reopen the city after the worst of a harrowing pandemic. On Sunday, his 100th day, his office announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Scott grew up privileged, though her family’s wealth was a long way from her current estimated $50 billion net worth after her marriage to the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But her parents declared bankruptcy when she was a teenager, and she needed a loan from a friend to stay at Princeton, where the acclaimed novelist Toni Morrison became her mentor.
After graduation, Scott worked as a waitress and struggled to make rent. She met and married Bezos while working at a financial firm and moved with him to Seattle, where they built Amazon.
Since their divorce, Scott has set about disbursing her enormous fortune with extraordinary speed. She has donated more than $12 billion to 1,257 organizations, with a goal of advancing social justice and equality, all while trying to keep herself out of the spotlight.

8. The freshwater springs of Florida’s underwater caves are at the center of a slow-motion environmental tragedy.
The world’s densest network of underground springs has fascinated humans for thousands of years, but now they are being ravaged by development, over-extraction, climate change and runoff from agriculture and sewage. Their aquifers are depleted and algae blooms have clouded the gin-clear water, depleting the larger ecosystem.
Pollution has also killed the sea grass that sustains Florida’s roughly 7,500 manatees, and many are starving to death. Extreme measures — like feeding them 202,000 pounds of romaine lettuce — may not be enough.

10. And finally, how a myth about starlings took flight.
In 1890, an eccentric named Eugene Schieffelin released a few dozen European starlings into Central Park, hoping to introduce all the bird species mentioned in Shakespeare’s plays to America. They now number about 85 million.
But two researchers recently concluded that crucial parts of the tale are false. Schieffelin’s portrayal as a Shakespeare superfan was a nature writer’s error, and records exist of earlier European starling introductions. So what else have scientists and naturalists gotten wrong about the much-reviled bird?

2022-04-12,"A group of actors and stage managers employed by a nonunion touring production of the musical “Waitress” is seeking union representation, emboldened by a growing focus on working conditions in the theater business and by the labor movement’s recent successes in other industries.
Actors’ Equity Association, a labor union representing 51,000 performers and stage managers, said it had collected signatures from more than the 30 percent of workers required to seek an election, and that on Tuesday it had submitted an election petition to the National Labor Relations Board, which conducts such elections.
The number of people affected is small — there are 22 actors and stage managers employed by the tour, according to Equity — but the move is significant because it is the first time Equity has tried to organize a nonunion tour since an unsuccessful effort two decades ago to unionize a touring production of “The Music Man.” (The union also sought a boycott of that production.)
Union officials said the “Waitress” tour was an obvious place for an organizing campaign because of an unusually clear comparison: There are currently two touring companies of that musical, one of which is represented by the union and one of which is not. The workers in the nonunion tour are being paid about one-third of what the workers in the union company are making, and have lesser safety protections, Equity said. (The minimum union actor salary is $2,244 per week.)

“We thought it was not right and not fair, so we approached them to see if they were interested in us representing them,” said Stefanie Frey, the union’s director of organizing and mobilization. Frey said that the productions were so similar that some of the nonunion performers have been asked to teach performers in the union production, and that some have moved from the nonunion production to the union production. “It’s an obvious group of people getting exploited,” she said.
Jennifer Ardizzone-West, the chief operating officer at NETworks Presentations, the company that is producing the nonunion “Waitress” tour, declined to offer an immediate reaction, saying, “Until we see the actual filing, it is premature for me to comment.”
Tours are an important, and lucrative, part of the Broadway economy. During the 2018-19 theater season — the last full season before the pandemic — unionized touring shows grossed $1.6 billion and were attended by 18.5 million people, according to the Broadway League. Similar statistics are not readily available for nonunion tours, but Frey said, “The nonunion tour world has grown over the last 15 years.”
Equity is in the process of hiring two additional organizers as it seeks to expand its efforts, according to a union spokesman, David Levy, who noted recent successful efforts to organize some employees at REI, Starbucks and Amazon. The National Labor Relations Board said last week that the number of union election petitions has been increasing dramatically.
Frey said the long pandemic shutdown of theaters had also contributed to a new interest in organizing in the theater industry. “Workers are feeling a little bit more of their power and want to fight for what they deserve in a different way,” she said."
2022-04-13,"INGLEWOOD, Calif. — Sebastian Joseph-Day, a former defensive tackle for the Los Angeles Rams, scrunched his face as he recognized his mistake.
Moments earlier, ahead of Joseph-Day’s practice rep as an analyst during the N.F.L.’s broadcaster boot camp last week, an instructor reminded him to remain unbiased and not say “we” or “us” as he described the action in a recorded Rams game.
But staying neutral may have been difficult for Joseph-Day, who spent three seasons with the team. Midway through the drill, an “us” slipped, but Joseph-Day, now a Los Angeles Charger, recovered and finished the exercise cleanly.
The N.F.L. created the workshop 15 years ago, partly because players repeatedly asked for opportunities to develop as broadcasters, to network, and to make blunders in a controlled setting.
This year’s camp, hosted at the league’s West Coast headquarters, occurred amid a ripe time in the media landscape, shortly after several commentators from the N.F.L.’s major broadcast partners switched jobs, most of them signing multimillion-dollar contracts. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck exited Fox after two decades for ESPN, and Al Michaels departed NBC after 15 years to call Thursday night games for Amazon. All will reportedly earn eight figures annually.
Image

The bloated salaries are products of the N.F.L.’s increasing popularity: The league’s games accounted for 48 of the 50 most-watched broadcasts in the 2021 regular season, and February’s Super Bowl recorded the game’s best ratings in five years. Players are noticing the trend and its benefits, said Larry Fitzgerald, a former Arizona Cardinals receiver who attended the program.
“The fan is watching N.F.L. games at a rate like never before, and I think that’s been seen by organizations paying top dollar for top talent,” he said.
Richard Sherman, the free agent cornerback and a camp attendee, added, “It’s definitely motivating a lot of guys, and it’s one of those places I think is going to start to get crowded.”
But none of the networks’ main play-by-play duos include a Black person and only one Black play-by-play announcer, Greg Gumbel for CBS in 2001 and 2004, has called a Super Bowl on television. Mike Tirico, who will replace Michaels at NBC, identifies as mixed race.
The lack of diversity among the talent working prime-time N.F.L. games is not ideal, said J.A. Adande, the director of sports journalism at Northwestern University.
“It’s big money and it makes you wonder who gets it and which broadcasters have these opportunities and paths available to them,” Adande said.

Current and former NFL players sit in on a live broadcast with Michael Robinson and MJ Acosta-Ruiz.
Tracy Perlman, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president of football operations, said she was optimistic that the camp could expand the pipeline. Media companies have long recruited former players as analysts because of their knowledge of the game and their reputations, but the list of ex-pros who failed to successfully transition to broadcasting is long and star-strewn.
Hall of Famers, including the quarterback Joe Montana and the running back Emmitt Smith, have stumbled with mics in their hands, a fate the camp is meant to prevent.
“Most people can’t just walk off the field and be in front of the camera,” Perlman said. “So we thought what could we do, especially with the partnerships that we have, to build a program that would give them those skills.”
With high demand and an aim to keep the instruction sessions small, the N.F.L. was more selective of participants than in previous years. The league sent out personal invitations and took recommendations from teams about reaching out to their players. Out of about 40 applicants, the N.F.L. chose 24 players — who were predominantly Black — based on their past experience appearing on camera and in podcasts, and their statements of interest. Faculty members included producers and hiring mangers from NBC, CBS, Fox Sports and NFL Network.
Image
Fitzgerald prepared in an empty conference room for a day of broadcasting exercises.
Nate Burleson, who played 11 seasons in the N.F.L. before retiring in 2014, is perhaps the camp’s most prominent alumnus. Burleson is nearly omnipresent on broadcast TV as a co-anchor for “CBS Mornings,” the network’s flagship morning news show, and host of “The NFL Today,” its weekly pregame show.
But back when he attended the camp in 2011, Burleson said he struggled in the play-by-play exercise. Though he said executives complimented him throughout the week, his performance in that drill continually irked him.
“As many reasons as the camp helped me improve who I was as a media personality, it was also honestly a slap in the face,” Burleson said.
The camp, he said, expanded his interests and made him want to become more versatile.
“It was like knowing what you wanted to do, but not having a full battery,” said Burleson, who won an Emmy award last year and was nominated for another last week. “Once you went, you were fully charged and you had direction.”
Image
Richard Sherman, a free agent, is still training but also has his career after football in mind.
This year’s class of players spent a full day last week in classroom sessions learning about the day-to-day work flow of broadcasters and interviewing techniques. The next day, they rotated through exercises that included on-camera debates against each other. Sandy Nunez, the vice president of on-air talent management at NFL Network, said she contacted a player’s agent about a potential job opening, and was smiling in the control room while a player completed an on-camera interview.
“I can get a lot of important information here,” Nunez said, “so there’s definitely a lot of value.”
Drew Kaliski, a coordinating producer for CBS, said he enjoyed hearing smart questions from the players, and the shuffling this off-season, he said, provided good conversation for the networks to be more inclusive.
“We do definitely need to diversify our announcing teams across the board everywhere, Kaliski said. “I think having a number of people to work with is going to make everyone better, stronger, smarter and ultimately the shows will be better.”
Because of low turnover in network positions, the faculty advised players to continue to practice on their own to stay prepared, suggesting they try for on-air appearances in their local markets or on podcasts because they have a lower barrier to entry compared to national shows.
Brandon Marshall, an N.F.L. receiver for 13 seasons, echoed their advice. Marshall never attended the camp, but gained contracts with Fox Sports and Showtime and created the “I AM ATHLETE” podcast, where he and other former players debate trending topics with guests that have included Deion Sanders and Antonio Brown.

Many of the episodes, which are also filmed for streaming, have garnered millions of views on YouTube. Marshall said he believes podcasting is a nontraditional avenue his peers can capitalize on, whether or not they received formal training like the camp attendees.
“There’s only so many seats at ESPN, but the awesome part about this space is that there’s no rules,” Marshall said. “People are winning here because they’re getting outside the box.”
Sherman, for one, has followed a similar path — trying to get journalistic reps outside of national broadcast opportunities — even as he navigates his free agency. In March, he broke the news that his former teammate in Seattle, linebacker Bobby Wagner, would join the Rams in free agency via his Twitter account and has used his eponymous podcast as a platform to address everything from draft prospects to his mental health after his 2021 arrest. Sherman, who represents himself in lieu of an agent, is still training, but he also is preparing for options after his playing career.
For him, talking about football is a natural extension of the all-encompassing work of players, “like walking and talking and breathing.”
He added: “It’s one of those things where you just enjoy being around the game and continuing to be a part of it some shape or fashion.”

Twitter’s next owner?

The endgame?
Elon Musk, Twitter’s largest shareholder and biggest agitator, offered this morning to buy the rest of the social media company and take it private. His “best and final offer,” as he put it in a financial filing, is $54.20 a share, nearly 40 percent higher than Twitter’s stock price before the mercurial billionaire’s purchases became public.
The bid caps an extraordinary two weeks for Twitter and Musk, which began with the Tesla chief disclosing that he had built up a 9-plus percent stake in the company, framed at the time as a passive investment. Twitter offered him a board seat, but he turned it down, removing any restrictions on his actions. “After the past several days of thinking this over, I have decided I want to acquire the company and take it private,” Musk told Twitter’s chairman, Bret Taylor, in a communication made public today.
Musk said he had lost confidence in Twitter’s management to fulfill the company’s “societal imperative” as a platform for free speech. “Twitter has extraordinary potential,” Musk said. “I will unlock it.” He has hired Morgan Stanley as an adviser for the bid and won’t play a “back-and-forth game” with his offer, he said.
So is this for real? It may seem strange to ask about a person with a net worth of $270 billion, but it’s noteworthy that there are no details about the financing of Musk’s proposal. His offer values Twitter at more than $40 billion, but his wealth is mostly in Tesla shares, and that company puts limits on what he can borrow against the stock. If he needs debt financing, Musk has burned bridges with major lenders, like JPMorgan Chase, so his choice of Morgan Stanley, which has a smaller balance sheet, is notable. (Silver Lake’s Egon Durban, a Twitter director, has experience taking technology companies private, but his private equity firm has a standstill agreement with Twitter that seemingly limits it from participating in a takeover.)
No, seriously, is this for real? Musk will face questions about whether he has the capacity to personally buy out a social media giant given his day jobs as C.E.O. of Tesla and SpaceX. (Twitter’s co-founder Jack Dorsey faced questions about whether he could be C.E.O. of Twitter and Square, and stepped down from Twitter.) It is also not lost on market watchers that $54.20 a share is an echo of Musk’s infamous, ill-fated 2018 proposal to take Tesla private at $420 per share. (For the uninitiated, 420 is slang in cannabis culture, and often used by Musk in more jokey contexts.) More pertinently, Twitter’s shares have jumped in premarket trading on Musk’s offer, but remain well below his price — they traded higher than his bid for much of last year, challenging his assertion that “it’s a high price and your shareholders will love it.”
Image
What happens next? Twitter said it would “carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the Company and all Twitter stockholders.” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, told DealBook that Musk’s approach “is going to put unbelievable pressure on the board from a fiduciary perspective.” Twitter’s board is likely to argue that the price is too low and question the strategic course of the company in Musk’s hands. (Musk, for example, has suggested that Twitter should get rid of advertising, its main revenue source.) The board could put in place a so-called poison pill, to prevent Musk or others from buying more shares, but other investors might not like that.
For a company with a fair few issues, including previous brushes with activist investors, the past few days have introduced an entirely new level of drama.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Starbucks may exclude unionized employees from new benefits. Howard Schultz, Starbucks’s interim C.E.O., told store managers that proposals meant to help lower attrition rates would not initially apply to newly unionized employees. The move raised questions from legal experts.
Amazon will ask third-party sellers for a “fuel and inflation surcharge.” The surcharge will add 5 percent to the fee for keeping inventory with Amazon to deliver to customers. FedEx and UPS have also raised fees in response to fuel costs.
The White House warns that supply chain problems won’t end with the pandemic. President Biden’s top economists say shortages and shipping bottlenecks will continue if America doesn’t invest in its supply chain. The report also calls on the government to do more to increase productivity and combat inequality.
The airline mask mandate continues. The C.D.C. said yesterday that travelers on planes and mass transit would be required to wear masks until at least May 3. Profits at airlines, which have asked for the mandate to be repealed, are rising as travel approaches prepandemic levels.
Economists call China’s official growth target unrealistic. Experts say China’s “zero Covid” policy will make it nearly impossible to achieve 5.5 percent G.D.P. growth this year. About a third of China’s population, or 373 million people, are in some sort of pandemic lockdown.

Banking on consumers
A key part of the U.S. pandemic recovery playbook has been to pump money into the pockets of consumers. It’s mostly worked. But this week’s first-quarter results from big banks reveal warning signs about the state of the U.S. consumer, whose spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the country’s economic output.

Profits are under pressure. At JPMorgan Chase, the country’s largest bank, earnings in its consumer division fell 57 percent from a year ago. Profits at the consumer banking units of Wells Fargo and Citigroup fell by 16 percent and 23 percent, respectively, they reported today. Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan, told analysts on a call yesterday that he was monitoring inflation, rising interest rates and war in Ukraine. “Those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear,” he said, or “they may not.”

Riskier lending is raising concerns. The 60-day delinquency rate on subprime auto loans in the U.S. was nearly 5 percent in February, the highest since early 2020 and up from under 4 percent a year ago. What’s more, investors are balking at risky loan deals, and some “Buy Now, Pay Later” lenders, which thrived under pandemic restrictions, have seen their shares plunge: Affirm’s stock is down 60 percent this year.
But consumers are still spending. Yesterday, Bank of America reported that consumers spent 11 percent more with its credit cards in March than a year earlier. Spending was up 15 percent in the first eight days of April. The banks’ recent results suggest, however, that there is a limit to what consumers can spend without trouble. “Consumer credit has been free for the banks, and that’s not going to be the case anymore,” said the banking industry consultant Christopher Whalen. “Consumers are not going to drive the economy as they have been.”
“These companies are fine during a very ebullient and frothy capital markets environment. The world has changed significantly in the past 60 days.”

Using antitrust law to protect workers’ pay
The Justice Department is leaning on an old law in a new way. The Sherman Act of 1890 prohibits corporations from conspiring to hurt consumers. In a first, the government has brought a series of criminal cases accusing employers of colluding to hold down wages, The Times’s Eduardo Porter reports.
If the courts agree, it could drastically alter the relationship between workers and employers. The department has filed six criminal cases under antitrust law. The push began late in the Trump administration, and President Biden has picked it up with a vengeance.
Corporate America is alarmed. “There is a role for antitrust in labor markets,” said Sean Heather, a senior vice president for antitrust at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “But it is a limited one.”

Is JPMorgan’s new weekend policy an improvement?
Last year, financial firms across Wall Street pledged to manage employee workloads better after junior bankers spoke out about grueling hours. But have the changes helped combat burnout?
The debate continues at JPMorgan, which has a new vacation policy for junior investment bankers: 10 federal holiday weekends off, and analysts and associates can choose one weekend each quarter to log off and not be contacted if work comes out. Previously, the bank allowed these workers to protect one weekend a month.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
JPMorgan said its policy was the best of all worlds. There are assured days off for weekends around holidays like Thanksgiving, Memorial Day and Juneteenth, in addition to four weekends a year that workers choose themselves.
But not all bankers agree. They say someone always needs to be available during the federal holiday weekends if work comes up (like a big deal). And now they have less choice to set aside other weekends for personal events like weddings.
Burnout became an industrywide debate amid soaring deal volume last year. Banks responded with policies to improve working conditions. For its part, JPMorgan has encouraged its bankers to leave the office by 7 p.m. on weekdays, among other things. But long hours and unpredictable workloads have long been part of the reality of the industry. Is JPMorgan’s new vacation policy an improvement or simply more of the same?
Speaking of time off, DealBook is taking a break tomorrow for the Good Friday holiday.

2022-04-15,"A stunning rise in the cost of jet fuel has sent airfares soaring, and industry experts say they are likely to go higher. For now, though, travel-starved consumers seem more than willing to pay up.
Jet fuel prices have settled somewhat since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent them skyrocketing last month, but the market remains extremely volatile. The problem is particularly severe in New York, where the cost of the fuel rose about fourfold to just over $7.50 a gallon before dipping back to $5.30 in recent days.
Supply is broadly constrained and prices have spiked across the country. The Energy Department this week said that the inventory level for East Coast jet fuel stood at 6.5 million barrels, the lowest since the agency began keeping track in 1990.
“Jet fuel has made the most parabolic move I’ve ever seen for any transportation fuel,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. “It’s just insane.”

The surge in prices has implications not only for airfares but also for the already high costs of global shipping. On Wednesday, for example, Amazon announced plans to impose its first “fuel and inflation surcharge” for sellers whose goods it stores and delivers.
Airlines have been able to pass on some of their added fuel expense to consumers, many of whom are more than eager to travel after being denied the opportunity for two years.
At the start of this year, the average cost of a round-trip domestic flight was $235, according to Hopper, an airfare-tracking app. Since then, ticket prices have risen 40 percent, to $330. Adit Damodaran, an economist at Hopper, which tracks prices for flights and hotels, said the company expects another 10 percent rise, to $360, by the end of May, before prices drop again in the summer.
“Not only are the current prices that travelers are paying extremely high compared to historic price data, but the rate of increase has also been particularly steep since January,” he said.
In addition to the rising cost of jet fuel, Mr. Damodaran said, the surge in airfares can also be attributed to typical seasonal patterns and the fact that demand was suppressed at the start of the year as the Omicron coronavirus variant spread.

Some airlines have also cut flights in response to persistent staff shortages, creating greater competition and driving up fares for the flights that remain.
Carriers typically pass on to consumers as much as 60 percent of a volatile rise in the price of fuel, experts said, a process that usually takes months. This time, however, the industry has been able to pass along costs more quickly, in large part because of high demand and a shift in consumer behavior during the pandemic toward buying tickets closer to the date of travel.
“We are successfully recapturing a significant portion of the run-up in fuel,” Ed Bastian, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, told investment analysts and reporters on a call on Wednesday. “This is occurring almost in real time, given the strong demand environment.”
Mr. Bastian said that Delta, the first major carrier to report financial results for the first three months of this year, had seen a strong rebound so far and that it was preparing for a robust spring and summer.
Delta paid an average price of $2.79 per gallon of jet fuel in the quarter, up 33 percent from the last quarter of last year. The price included a saving of 7 cents per gallon from the airline’s oil refinery outside Philadelphia. Delta said it expected the price of fuel to rise another 15 to 20 percent over the next three months, to between $3.20 and $3.35 per gallon, a range that includes an approximately 20-cent savings attributable to the refinery.

Prices for jet fuel, like gasoline and diesel, generally go up and down with crude oil.
In February, American Airlines reported that the price it paid per gallon of jet fuel had risen more than a third over the past year, from $1.48 in 2020 to $2.04 in 2021. At the time, it said that each sustained one-cent rise in the per-gallon price would increase its fuel expense for 2022 by about $40 million. This week, American estimated that it had paid $2.80 to $2.85 per gallon in the first quarter of the year.
Rising fuel costs and fares seem to be doing little to dissuade consumers. Mr. Bastian said Wednesday that March was Delta’s best sales month ever, beating a record set in 2019, despite having 10 percent fewer seats available. That comes as fares for domestic flights were up about 20 percent across the board between March 2019 and March 2022, according to an analysis by the Adobe Digital Economy Index, which draws on online sales from six of the top 10 U.S. airlines.

“We’ve all been stuck at home for two years, and I think now that we have the opportunity to get out, there’s going to be a lot of willingness to pay,” said Joe Rohlena, lead airline analyst for Fitch Ratings. “If it remains expensive to travel further out, then you may see that kind of willingness to pay higher ticket prices back off.”
The pandemic severely diminished air travel, so it was no surprise that jet fuel prices plunged even more deeply than those for gasoline two years ago. In most of 2020, as the pandemic throttled transportation of all kinds, American refineries slashed their output of jet fuel — usually a reliable profit-maker — by as much as a million barrels a day.

But even in a business as cyclical as refining, the recovery for jet fuel has been remarkable.
Richard Joswick, head of global oil analytics at S&P Global Commodity Insights, said pipeline flows of jet fuel, though increasing, had not kept up with demand.
A few shipments that were supposed to go to New York this month were redirected through the Panama Canal to Los Angeles as California fuel prices began to climb. Other fuel was redirected to Baltimore and Washington as supplies there ran short.
“It’s like a water balloon — you squeeze it one place, it bulges out someplace else,” Mr. Joswick said.
Experts are predicting price spikes in the Rocky Mountain region and the West Coast as the summer travel season reaches its peak in July and August. Stockpiles are also low elsewhere in the country, with many airports stocking only a three-day supply, jeopardizing schedules if there is a bad-weather event like a hurricane.
Refineries produce jet fuel from the same batch of oil as diesel, and refineries are producing as much diesel as they can. Europe has curtailed its purchases of Russian diesel since the invasion of Ukraine, and instead imported more diesel from the United States, even as truck and railroad traffic has recovered here.

Refinery closings in Europe and North America in recent years have been another contributing factor. Since January 2019, refinery capacity has declined 5 percent in the United States and 6 percent in Europe, according to Turner, Mason & Company, a consulting firm in Dallas.
John Auers, Turner, Mason’s executive vice president, said it was hard to produce more jet fuel when the market was demanding more diesel, and equally hard to produce more diesel when the market was demanding more jet fuel. “People are traveling, driving and flying, and there is more commerce, so we’re going to have a tight market,” he said.
While the higher jet fuel costs have hurt airlines and consumers, refinery executives are happy for the extra business after two years of scant profits.
“Travel is up and demand for fuel is up, and with the Russian invasion impacting prices, fortunately or unfortunately, it bodes well for oil companies and jet fuel producers,” said Linda Salinas, vice president for operations at Texmark Chemicals, a Texas company that produces renewable jet fuel out of undistilled diesel made from used cooking oil and waste."

The Indigenous Brazilian territory of Ituna-Itatá was established in 2011 for the protection of an isolated group that has never been contacted by outsiders or fully confirmed to exist. But despite its special status, it has become one of the most invaded Indigenous territories in Brazil since the election of the pro-development, anti-regulatory president, Jair Bolsonaro, in 2018 — becoming something of a poster board for the Amazon’s eventual demise.
William Langewiesche explores the process of defending these preserves from outside harm, and uses Ituna-Itatá, which has now been heavily deforested, as a grim illustration of the intractable forces destroying the Amazon through logging, ranching and mining.
In this long read, the consequences these industrial activities have on biodiversity and the global environment are explained, using the vantage point of Ituna-Itatá to show how the land-grabbing, which was approaching inexorably upriver along the Xingu, has been propelled by the economic boom that resulted from the construction near Altamira of a large hydroelectric dam.
Everything is connected — but can the chain of destruction be broken?

2022-04-18,"Democrats are the party of working people. Ahead of the 2020 election, we advanced ideas and plans that we believed would, in ways big and small, make our democracy and our economy work better for all Americans. Across this country, voters agreed with us — and gave us a majority in Washington so that we could deliver on those promises.
Republican senators and broken institutions have blocked much of that promised progress. Now Republicans are betting that a stalled Biden agenda won’t give Democrats enough to run on in the midterm elections — and they might be right. Despite pandemic relief, infrastructure investments and the historic Supreme Court confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, we promised more — and voters remember those promises.
Republicans want to frame the upcoming elections to be about “wokeness,” cancel culture and the “militant left wing.” Standing up for the inherent dignity of everyone is a core American value, and Democrats are proud to do that every day. While Republican politicians peddle lies, fear and division, we should use every single one of the next 200 days or so before the election to deliver meaningful improvements for working people.
Democrats win elections when we show we understand the painful economic realities facing American families and convince voters we will deliver meaningful change. To put it bluntly: if we fail to use the months remaining before the elections to deliver on more of our agenda, Democrats are headed toward big losses in the midterms.

Time is running short. We need to finalize a budget reconciliation deal, making giant corporations pay their share to fund vital investments in combating climate change and lowering costs for families, which can advance with only 50 Senate votes. Other priorities can be done with the president’s executive authority. It’s no secret that I believe we should abolish the filibuster. But if Republicans want to use it to block policies that Americans broadly support, we should also force them to take those votes in plain view.

Let’s begin with corruption. For years, Americans have identified corrupt government officials as a top concern. And they’re right: to tackle the urgent challenges we face — climate change, income inequality, systemic injustice — we must root out corruption. To start cleaning up government, members of Congress and their spouses shouldn’t be allowed to own or trade individual stocks, which the vast majority of voters support banning, according to multiple polls. Whether you’re a Republican senator or the Democratic speaker of the House, it is obvious to the American people that they should not be allowed to trade individual stocks and then vote on laws that affect those companies. I have the strongest plan and the only bipartisan bill in the Senate to get it done.
We can also act quickly to rein in costs for middle-class families. In the very short term, that means stopping companies from jacking up prices to boost their profits. Price increases are driven by many factors, including pandemic disruptions to global supply chains and Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. But when the Kroger chief executive, Rodney McMullen, said “a little bit of inflation is always good in our business,” it’s no surprise that, by a margin of two-to-one, American voters don’t buy the explanation that companies are just passing along costs. Instead, they blame corporations for raising prices to boost their own profits. Even Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a conservative Republican, acknowledged that giant corporations raise prices simply “because they can.”
The president deserves enormous credit for advancing an ambitious agenda to promote competition and appointing effective regulators to enforce our antitrust laws, and it’s time for congressional Democrats to have his back. According to Data for Progress surveys, eight in 10 Americans believe Congress should pass laws to reinvigorate competition and three-quarters strongly believe that oil and gas companies should not make gobs of money off this energy crisis. Beefing up regulators’ authority to end price-gouging, breaking up monopolies, and passing a windfall profits tax is a good start. Only in Washington, where America’s biggest companies spend billions to drown out reality, are these controversial ideas. Across America, these are popular plans.
We can stand up to the armies of lobbyists and P.R. flacks and tackle tax loopholes for the rich and powerful. About two-thirds of likely American voters — including a majority of Republicans — say it’s time for billionaires to pay more in taxes. Nearly three-quarters of Americans want to put an end to wildly profitable corporations paying nothing or little in federal income taxes (yes, Amazon, I’m looking at you) and put into place a global minimum corporate tax. And a majority of Americans would like to use some of those tax revenues to invest in clean energy, affordable child care, and universal pre-K.

That’s a big legislative agenda, but it isn’t big enough. We also need to use every tool of the presidency to deliver for working people.
For example, by a margin of more than two-to-one, Americans support providing some student loan debt cancellation — an action the president could take entirely on his own. Doing so would lift the economic outlook for too many borrowers who still weren’t able to get a college diploma, for the millions of female borrowers who shoulder about two-thirds of all student loan debt, and for Black and Hispanic borrowers, a higher percentage of whom take on debt to attend college compared to white students, and have a harder time paying it off after school. With the stroke of a pen, the president could make massive strides to close gender and racial wealth gaps.
And he can do more. Decisive action on everything from lowering prescription drug prices to ensuring that more workers are eligible for overtime pay can be executed by the president alone, using the authority already given to him by existing laws, without rounding up 50 Senate votes.
Like many Americans, I’m frustrated by our failure to get big things done — things that are both badly needed and very popular with all Americans. While Republican politicians obstruct many efforts to improve people’s lives and many swear loyalty to the Big Lie, the urgency of the next election bears down on us.
Democrats cannot bow to the wisdom of out-of-touch consultants who recommend we simply tout our accomplishments. Instead, Democrats need to deliver more of the president’s agenda — or else we will not be in the majority much longer.

Re “Judge Rescinds Mask Mandate for Passengers” (front page, April 19):
A federal judge who was deemed “not qualified” by the American Bar Association has just struck down the C.D.C.’s mask mandate on public transportation, in the name of reinstating lost freedoms.
More than being angered by this ludicrous decision, however, I’m deeply saddened by our simple lack of heart for our fellow citizens. Do Americans really not care about their parents, grandparents or those like me who are immunocompromised, who will now be virtually unable to fly? It hurts.
The administration must back up the C.D.C.’s authority and appeal this decision. At the least, airports should offer special areas for those who need to wear N95s and are fearful of exposure to unmasked crowds.

To the Editor:
A single Federal District Court judge in Florida has vacated a nationwide C.D.C. order requiring mask wearing on planes and on mass transit. I have no opinion of the correctness of her legal analysis. However, Federal District Court trial judges should not have the power to issue nationwide stays or injunctions.
Putting this extraordinary power in the hands of a single district court judge does nothing but encourage judge shopping by litigants, particularly special interest groups. I am certain the founding fathers never envisioned that such power would reside in a single trial judge.
This power has been abused by both the left and the right as special interest groups seek a favorable forum in which to challenge laws and agency rules and regulations. It is time for Congress to address this issue and limit the geographic reach of district court orders.

She has given large gifts to Habitat for Humanity ($436 million) and Planned Parenthood ($275 million). She has given to underrepresented people, including groups led by women, people of color and L.G.B.T.Q. people. Her gifts also reflect her concern with climate change, education and, recently, Ukraine relief.
Her generosity and humanitarianism are in stark contrast to so many superwealthy people who never seem to have enough, who are forever concerned about their taxes.
Can MacKenzie Scott inspire other ultrawealthy people to be more generous and humanitarian and less fixated on self-aggrandizement?

Young children exposed to the trauma of war are at high risk of developing PTSD. Even if they did not see the violence, they can develop PTSD from what their family members have been through. Art and play therapy help them cope and heal.
I have felt conflicted about how different our global response to the refugee crisis in Ukraine, where many of the children have blue eyes and blond hair and identify as Christians, has been. I have provided art therapy for them just as we have for Syrian children in Beirut.
Many of my little Picassos in Beirut are now young adults. Because they have brown eyes, olive skin and are Muslim, they did not receive the same level of love and concern from the West.
As we care for the Ukrainian mothers and children, please consider also supporting the Syrian children, many of whom have been waiting for more than a decade to find a new home and a brighter future.

A.I. and Problem Gambling

To the Editor:
Re “Can A.I. Help Casinos Cut Down on Problem Gambling?” (Business, April 4):
The answer is no, A.I. cannot cut down on problem gambling.
First, we should refer to casino gambling as what it is. It is not “gambling” in the usual sense of the word; it is “negative expectation gambling,” meaning that you will lose in the long run.
This would provide consumers with a reminder about what this is all about. This does not take A.I.; it just takes truth in advertising. Calling casino gambling what it really is seems sort of a buzz-kill, but reality is that way sometimes.
Second, casinos use every conscious and subconscious signal to keep you gambling. These tools are overwhelming and simply too much for some to resist. Unless this is addressed through further regulation, problem gambling will continue to be a major problem no matter how much the casinos claim they care.

2022-04-20,"Employees at an Apple store in Atlanta filed a petition on Wednesday to hold a union election. If successful, the workers could form the first union at an Apple retail store in the United States.
The move continues a recent trend of service-sector unionization in which unions have won elections at Starbucks, Amazon and REI locations.
The workers are hoping to join the Communications Workers of America, which represents workers at companies like AT&T Mobility and Verizon, and has made a concerted push into the tech sector in recent years.
The union says that about 100 workers at the store — at Cumberland Mall, in northwest Atlanta — are eligible to vote, including salespeople and repair technicians, and that over 70 percent of them have signed authorization cards indicating their support.
In a statement, the union said Apple, like other tech employers, had effectively created a tiered work force that denied retail workers the pay, benefits and respect that workers earned at its corporate offices.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
Workers said they loved working at Apple but sometimes felt they were treated like second-class employees. “We want equal to what corporate actually gets,” said Sydney Rhodes, an employee at the store who is involved in the union campaign.

2022-04-21,"Arshia Khan asked a group of older adults in Minnesota what they would like in a nursing home, and their answer surprised her. They wanted standup comedy, but not just any comedy: They wanted off-color jokes.
Dr. Khan, a professor of computer science at the University of Minnesota Duluth, programs robots to work in nursing homes.
On a March afternoon in her lab, surrounded by a dozen robots of different sizes and designs, Dr. Khan asked one to show off its stuff. The robot, a four-foot-tall white plastic figure named Pepper, with a tablet screen in its chest, blinked its eyes and wiggled its hips.
“So, which one of you requested the dirty jokes?” Pepper asked, in a computer voice.
There followed a risqué joke about the robot’s relationship with its charging plug, and another about an unhappy date with a Tesla (too conceited). After each, the robot giggled. “I went on a date with a Roomba last week,” the robot said, gesticulating with its arms. Pause. “It totally sucked.”
Later this year, pending approval from the university’s institutional review board, 16 of Dr. Khan’s robots will go to eight nursing homes around the state — though without the  off-color jokes.
The robot program in Duluth is just one of several newly energized efforts to use robots and other technology to solve some of the problems in nursing homes and assisted living facilities — or to help people stay out of them. The trend began before the pandemic, but Covid-19 gave it new urgency.

2022-04-22,"The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation.
The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union.
The law aims to end an era of self-regulation in which tech companies set their own policies about what content could stay up or be taken down. It stands out from other regulatory attempts by addressing online speech, an area that is largely off limits in the United States because of First Amendment protections. Google, which owns YouTube, and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, would face yearly audits for “systemic risks” linked to their businesses, while Amazon would confront new rules to stop the sale of illegal products.
The Digital Services Act is part of a one-two punch by the European Union to address the societal and economic effects of the tech giants. Last month, the 27-nation bloc agreed to a different sweeping law, the Digital Markets Act, to counter what regulators see as anticompetitive behavior by the biggest tech firms, including their grip over app stores, online advertising and internet shopping.

Together, the new laws underscore how Europe is setting the standard for tech regulation globally. Frustrated by anticompetitive behavior, social media’s effect on elections and privacy-invading business models, officials spent more than a year negotiating policies that give them broad new powers to crack down on tech giants that are worth trillions of dollars and that are used by billions of people for communication, entertainment, payments and news.
“This will be a model,” Alexandra Geese, a Green party member of the European Parliament from Germany, said of the new law. Ms. Geese, who helped draft the Digital Services Act, said she had already spoken with legislators in Japan, India and other countries about the legislation."

What’s Up? (April 17-23)
A Bad Week for CNN+ and Netflix
After pouring tens of millions of dollars into a nationwide marketing campaign, big-name stars and hundreds of new employees, CNN announced Thursday it was shutting down CNN+, its weeks-old streaming platform. Executives at Discovery, CNN’s new owner, were said to be concerned about underwhelming interest from subscribers. The news fueled questions — particularly after Netflix’s disastrous earnings report last week — about the longer-term outlook for streaming services. Netflix said on Tuesday that it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter and expected some two million more to leave the platform over the next three months. It was the first time in a decade the company lost subscribers, and its shares plunged 35 percent.
Florida Takes On the Magic Kingdom
Escalating its tangle with Disney World, Florida lawmakers advanced a measure to strip the theme park of a privilege that has allowed it to effectively self-govern its vast property in the state for more than 50 years. Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers of the legislature, were spurred on by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who cleared a path for the lawmakers to vote on bills that would eliminate special tax districts created before 1968. He signed the legislation on Friday. The move is widely seen as retaliation for Disney’s opposition to what some call the “Don’t Say Gay” law, which limits instruction on gender and sexuality in some elementary school grades.
Masks Drop on Public Transportation
Many of the country’s major airlines dropped their mask mandates after a federal judge appointed during the Trump administration struck down the requirement for airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation. Airlines including American, Delta and United, which have had to deal with unruly passengers who refused to comply with the mandate, swiftly announced they were no longer requiring masks, and Delta later said it would allow people who were placed on its no-fly list for defying its previous mask policy to fly once again.  The Biden administration said it would appeal the ruling.

What’s Next? (April 24-30)
An Economic Slowdown
The gross domestic product report for the first quarter, which will be released on Thursday, is expected to show that economic growth in the United States slowed significantly in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is partly because of the Omicron wave, which kept many Americans at home in January and disrupted service industries and manufacturing. The report will also help show to what extent inflation — which reached 8.5 percent last month — may be holding back consumers as well as the broader economy. The G.D.P. data from the last quarter of 2021 illustrated how inflation can obscure how much of the country’s economy is recovering from the depths of the pandemic. Output in the United States still had not caught up to prepandemic levels, last quarter’s report showed, because consumers’ dollars are worth less than before.

Elon Musk’s Money Moves
Twitter is releasing its quarterly earnings report this week, and a significant part will probably deal with Elon Musk’s determined efforts to acquire the company and give investors an idea about whether his offer is sufficient. In an attempt to make the company’s board take his offer more seriously, Mr. Musk said on Thursday in a federal filing that he had commitments worth $46.5 billion — a mix of debt and cash — to finance his bid.  The documents also showed that Mr. Musk was considering a hostile takeover, which would involve bringing the bid directly to shareholders. Twitter’s board has already made provisions to thwart such a move, adopting a so-called poison pill that would block Mr. Musk from buying an unlimited number of Twitter shares.
A Big Bet on Gaming
Activision Blizzard shareholders will vote Thursday on whether to merge with Microsoft. For Microsoft, which announced in January that it wanted to acquire the video game company for almost $70 billion, the deal would serve at least two major purposes: In the long term, it plants a flag in the metaverse, the virtual world where tech companies like Facebook are placing big bets.  In the shorter term, the acquisition helps Microsoft get ahead of its rival Sony in the race for gamers’ attention and dollars and keeps the company competitive with Amazon and Google, which have also entered the gaming market. If Activision shareholders approve the deal — and they are likely to do so — it still faces the scrutiny of antitrust regulators.
What Else?
Airlines expect a travel boom in the coming months. Workers at an Apple store in Atlanta filed a petition to hold a union election. The Federal Reserve is weighing a larger-than-usual increase in interest rates, of half a percentage point, for its May meeting."

Chasing the bird
What seemed highly improbable a week and a half ago is now looking a lot more real: Twitter is in advanced talks to sell itself to Elon Musk. The company’s 11-member board was negotiating with Musk into the early hours of the morning over his offer to buy the social networking service and take it private, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and The Times’s Mike Isaac report.
The two sides have been discussing details, including a timeline to close any potential deal and any fees that would be paid if an agreement were signed and then fell apart, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The negotiations followed a board meeting yesterday morning to discuss the offer. No deal is certain, and it remains entirely possible that the talks will break down. It is rare for a board to try to hammer through a deal as quickly as this.
Through it all, Musk kept tweeting. Musk took aim at Bill Gates over the weekend, saying Gates had taken a short position in Tesla’s stock, betting that it would fall. Musk was responding to a tweet that included texts he apparently exchanged with Gates about potential philanthropic projects. Minutes later, he mocked Gates’s physical appearance in a tweet that got 1.1 million “likes.” Yesterday, before his meeting with Twitter’s board, Musk tweeted that he was “moving on” from “making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action.”
The tweets may be a glimpse at how Twitter would run under Musk’s ownership. Critics say they were just the latest example of Musk using the platform, and his enormous following on it, as a bully pulpit, whether directed at billionaires or others. Musk has said he wants Twitter to fulfill its “societal imperative” as a platform for free speech. But as DealBook has reported, that raises real questions of what might happen to Twitter under his watch, given the tone he is setting and the problems that plagued the network’s previous C.E.O., Jack Dorsey, before he embraced a more rules-based approach to content moderation. Dorsey had said that he “didn’t fully predict or understand the real-world negative consequences” of a more unfettered service. To what extent will Twitter’s board weigh the potential for more “real-world negative consequences” against the money put forward by Musk?

Stocks slid on Tuesday, adding to a losing streak that has April shaping up to be Wall Street’s worst month in two years.
The S&P 500 fell 2.8 percent, bringing its losses for the month to 7.8 percent. The index is on track for its worst monthly decline since March 2020, when stocks plunged 12.5 percent as the coronavirus spread around the world, prompting lockdowns and halting economic activity.
The steady drop — with only six days of gains in April — has come as investors have confronted a long list of fears: that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates far more quickly than economists had anticipated; that rising prices and wages could erode corporate profits; and that renewed lockdowns in China could become another drag on the global economy.
Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund projected global growth would slow this year to 3.6 percent, from 6.1 percent in 2021. That was before a new Covid outbreak in Beijing raised concerns about more restrictions in China, the world’s second-largest economy, where cities like Shanghai have already been under lockdown for weeks.

“China slows down the rest of the world if it shuts down,” said Victoria Greene, the chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm. “If China shuts down, that could shut down commerce, and that slows down overall global demand.”
On Tuesday, technology stocks led the retreat on Wall Street, ahead of earnings reports from Alphabet, Microsoft and — later in the week — Meta, Amazon and Apple. Shares of all five companies were lower. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted toward tech, fell about 4 percent.
Also lower were shares of Tesla, which fell more than 12 percent. The company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, may have to sell a big chunk of his stock in the carmaker to fund his takeover of Twitter. He has pledged $21 billion in cash as part of the deal, in addition to loans. Tesla’s shares are often more volatile than those of other large companies, and they can weigh on the broader S&P 500 when they fall because of the company’s huge valuation.

“Tesla investors are worried that Musk might spend too much time trying to fix the social media giant’s problems, and that will take away his laserlike focus in winning the electric vehicle race,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA.
Among the worst performers in the S&P 500 was General Electric, which fell 10.3 percent after it said its outlook for the year was “trending toward the low end” of its previous forecast for profits and listed nearly every one of Wall Street’s concerns as a factor.

“We’re experiencing increased pressure from inflation, renewable energy and the Russia-Ukraine war,” H. Lawrence Culp Jr., the company’s chief executive, said on a conference call with investors on Tuesday, when explaining the outlook. “We’re also watching to evolving areas, namely additional supply chain pressure and recent Covid impacts in China.”
Concerns over an economic slowdown in the United States and abroad have weighed on investors’ minds all month. Already, companies and consumers have borne higher costs for goods and transportation, with inflation reaching 8.5 percent in the year through March.
But the conflict in Ukraine and the shutdowns in China have also triggered volatility in energy markets, with crude oil surging in early March before retreating slightly in April. That has spilled over into the stock market, too.
“There’s been a pendulum going back and forth,” said Ms. Greene. “We go from saying oil prices are too high to saying we’re going to see oil prices come down because we don’t have the demand we thought we would see.”
Futures for Brent crude, the international standard, were up about 2.5 percent on Tuesday to about $105 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, for June delivery was up 3.2 percent to $101.70 a barrel.

Investors are also contending with the Fed’s approach toward raising interest rates in the coming months in efforts to cool down inflation. Although Wall Street was already pricing in several rate increases this year, Fed officials have adopted a more aggressive tone this month about their willingness to raise rates quickly to try and stem inflation, and analysts are worried that the central bank could tip the economy into a recession.
“The only way to cool off inflation will be to destroy demand and raise unemployment,” said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute. “It won’t be as simple as raising rates as the markets are expecting.”

2022-04-27,"Comcast and Charter Communications, two of America’s largest cable companies, said on Wednesday that they would team up to offer customers set-top boxes for video streaming, using their combined reach to better compete with established players like Roku and Amazon.
Connected TVs, which allow users to watch movies and shows over the internet, have been booming. The increased adoption of streaming services, and the growth of advertising on these platforms, have made the connected TV market competitive ground in the fight for consumer attention.
Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal and operates the Xfinity cable brand, has made strides in the field over the last decade, developing X1, a set-top box system that allows customers to stream video, and the XClass TV, a connected TV sold by Walmart with an operating system developed by the cable giant. Comcast also operates Xumo, an ad-supported streaming app available on connected TVs that allows customers to watch some live TV in addition to on-demand shows.
The partnership between Comcast and Charter, which owns the Spectrum cable brand, is structured as a 50-50 joint venture, in which Charter will distribute streaming devices based on Comcast’s technology, the companies said. Charter will contribute $900 million over several years to the venture, which doesn’t yet have a name.
Although Comcast and Charter have long had a presence in the connected TV market, the partnership will allow both companies to continue to expand their market share and make their services more attractive to customers, potentially lowering subscriber churn.
Rich Greenfield, a partner at the analyst firm LightShed, said the venture could result in a national beachhead for Comcast and Charter, which have largely stood by and allowed Roku to become the dominant player in the connected TV market.
Mr. Greenfield also said the deal should put to rest speculation that Comcast might acquire Roku.
“Comcast and Charter were gatekeepers to the broadcast and cable network world for the last 30 years,” Mr. Greenfield said. “And they’ve allowed all of these tech companies to become the gatekeepers to the connected TV world. And finally, in 2022, these companies are finally waking up and realizing that they’ve basically missed this entire opportunity.”"

When to watch: Arrives Friday, on Apple TV+.
This new seven-part series about the World Surf League is as tanned and juicy as you would hope, tracing the horse race of the competition season and also exploring a handful of the athletes’ back stories. “Break” moves and feels a lot like “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” perhaps because the shows share a production company and executive producers; like its Netflix cousin, this is not particularly probing, but it is gorgeous, exciting and very bingeable. And unlike most other sports documentaries of the moment, this show follows the sagas of female athletes, too, not just the men.

When to watch: Sunday at 9 p.m., on CNN.
Stanley Tucci sets off for another season of sumptuous Italian adventures, this time kicking things off in Venice, where he goes duck hunting, eats risotto and learns about the cross pollination of European food traditions. It’s all very chic and charming. Compared to its robust food-and-travelogue brethren, “Searching for Italy” is less frenetic and self-conscious; it feels more like a lush vacation, the kind where you spend the whole trip declaring, “I’m so glad we’re doing this.” If you are the person who says “cin cin” when toasting, clear your calendar for the next four Sundays.

When to watch: Season 2 arrives Friday, on Amazon.
There are so many mild shows right now, shows that are perfectly fine. But when I watch them, I can’t help but wish the whole show would take a vitamin and try again, and this time, really go after it. That’s part of what’s so mesmerizing about the half-hour animated drama “Undone”: It has absolutely taken its vitamins, and it attacks its ideas with ferocious drive. Season 1 centers on Alma (played by Rosa Salazar) and her understanding of a sort of time-loop mysticism. Season 2 includes more of her family’s stories, making the show deeper and richer than seemed possible. If you like wistful beauty, or you just can’t get enough Bob Odenkirk (he plays Alma’s father), watch this. Start at the beginning — the seasons are only eight episodes each."
2022-04-29,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Elon Musk opened a Tesla factory in Shanghai in 2019, the Chinese government welcomed him with billions of dollars’ worth of cheap land, loans, tax breaks and subsidies. “I really think China is the future,” Mr. Musk cheered.
Tesla’s road since then has been lucrative, with a quarter of the company’s revenue in 2021 coming from China, but not without problems. The firm faced a consumer and regulatory revolt in China last year over manufacturing flaws.
With his deal to take over Twitter, Mr. Musk’s ties to China are about to get even more fraught.
Like all foreign investors in China, he operates Tesla at the pleasure of the Chinese authorities, who have shown a willingness to influence or punish companies that cross political red lines. Even Apple, the world’s most valuable company, has given in to Chinese demands, including censoring its App Store.
Mr. Musk’s extensive investments in China could be at risk if Twitter upsets the Communist Party state, which has banned the platform at home but used it extensively to push Beijing’s foreign policy around the globe — often with false or misleading information.
At the same time, China now has a sympathetic investor who is taking control of one of the world’s most influential megaphones. Mr. Musk said nothing publicly, for example, when the authorities in Shanghai shut down Tesla’s plant as part of the citywide effort to control the latest Covid-19 outbreak, even after lambasting officials in Alameda County, Calif., for a similar step when the pandemic began in 2020.
“It’s concerning to think about what could be a conflict of interests in these situations, looking at disinformation that could come out of China,” said Jessica Maddox, an assistant professor of digital media technology at the University of Alabama. “How would he, as now an owner of this company, handle that since all of his investments are tied up there, or most of them?”

What’s Up? (April 24-30)
Elon Musk to Buy Twitter
Elon Musk reached an agreement on Monday to buy Twitter for about $44 billion, a deal that was unanimously approved by Twitter’s board. The price works out to $54.20 a share, a 38 percent premium over the company’s share price in April, before Mr. Musk revealed he had purchased a 9 percent stake in Twitter. In a matter of weeks, Mr. Musk, the richest person in the world, took his bid from something that investors shrugged off to a serious proposal. The turning point came when he filed documents showing he had the financing to back up his offer. Now, it could be the largest deal to take a company private in at least 20 years, according to data from Dealogic. Still, much remains uncertain as to how the mercurial billionaire will carry out his vision for a platform with less moderation.
Charges of Stock Manipulation
The latest chapter of one of the most high-profile Wall Street investigations in years unfolded on Wednesday, when federal agents arrested Bill Hwang, the owner of the investment firm Archegos Capital Management, and its former chief financial officer, Patrick Halligan, at their homes. The two were charged with racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud, all in connection with a scheme, according to a 59-page indictment, that involved deliberately misleading banks and manipulating stock prices. Initially, they were able to evade scrutiny because of the loose regulations around “family offices” like Archegos — firms that manage investments for the ultrawealthy. But the company imploded last year, and $100 billion in shareholder value vanished almost overnight. Through their lawyers, the men entered not guilty pleas.
Economy Shrinks Yet Remains Resilient
The U.S. economy contracted in the first three months of the year, with the gross domestic product declining 0.4 percent in the first quarter when adjusted for inflation, or 1.4 percent on an annualized basis. The decline had to do largely with slower growth in inventories and a growing trade deficit, as U.S. exports were far outpaced by imports. Absent these, a measure of underlying growth rose 0.6 percent in the first quarter, and the White House preferred to focus on the data without what President Biden called the “technical factors” of inventories and trade. Mr. Biden also pointed to bright spots in the G.D.P. report on Thursday that showed strong consumer spending and continued business investment — signs that the economic recovery is still resilient.

What’s Next? (May 1-7)
A Jobs Report That May Look Familiar
The job numbers for April will be released on Friday, and they are expected to look similar to those from March. Analysts expect a gain of about 385,000 jobs — U.S. employers added 431,000 in March — and an unchanged unemployment rate of 3.6 percent. Last month, some economists suggested that jobs “might be approaching their as-good-as-it-gets moment” and that factors like rapid inflation and higher interest rates could soon slow the labor market. The economy has recovered more than 90 percent of the 22 million jobs lost at the peak of pandemic lockdowns in the spring of 2020, but the Federal Reserve’s interventions and other forces threaten to cut into those gains.

The Fed Weighs a Bigger Rate Increase
A much-anticipated Federal Reserve meeting will take place this week, and Jerome H. Powell, the central bank’s chair, has heavily hinted at what to expect. Last month, Mr. Powell said he thought it was “appropriate” to move more quickly to address rapid inflation and noted that a larger-than-usual increase of half a percentage point would be “on the table” for the May meeting. When the Fed raised interest rates a quarter of a percentage point in March, officials said it would be the first of seven increases this year; now, some are saying that nine may be necessary. These signals from the Fed contributed to a sharp market decline for much of April, with investors worried that higher rates could cut into corporate profits and consumer spending.
OPEC Plus to Weigh In
In March, as oil prices soared and the Biden administration announced a plan to release up to 180 million barrels of oil from a strategic reserve to cushion the impact of Russia’s war on Ukraine, OPEC Plus pushed ahead with a modest increase. The group of countries, which includes Russia, said at the time that it would increase oil output in May by 432,000 barrels a day because it anticipated a “well-balanced market” despite the volatility. OPEC Plus may rethink its wait-and-see approach this week, especially after Germany suggested that it was no longer opposed to an embargo on Russian oil. But some experts say the group is not expected to take any drastic measures.
What Else?
Meta, Facebook’s parent company, reported a 21 percent drop in profits from a year earlier. A union vote is underway at a second Amazon warehouse on Staten Island, and results are expected as early as Monday. President Biden said he would make a final decision on broad student loan forgiveness “in the coming weeks.”"

A rate increase… and then what?
The Federal Reserve is meeting this week. The economy is running hot, and the Fed is trying to slow it down before widespread price pressures become even more of a problem. It lifted interest rates in March for the first time since 2018, by a quarter of a percentage point, and has set the stage for an even larger increase of half a percentage point this week. The announcement is expected to come at the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon.
But while the rate decision is unlikely to be a surprise, economists and investors will want to know how the Fed plans to move forward at a time when inflation is rising faster than it has in decades. The recent performance of the stock market, which in April took its biggest monthly dive in two years, is hinting at economic trouble ahead, and is the latest complication in the Fed’s fight against inflation.
The outlook for inflation is wildly uncertain, report The Times’s Jeanna Smialek and Ben Casselman. On one hand, the Fed’s small rate increase has already pushed mortgage rates sharply higher, which may start to weigh on the housing market and cool off related types of demand. Nonetheless, costs for raw materials and other key inputs continue to climb, and may keep doing so amid the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. Already, some companies, like the washing-machine maker Whirlpool, are seeing consumer demand wane compared with last year, though it is still higher than before the pandemic. “Historic levels of inflation, notably in raw materials, energy and logistics, will impact us throughout the year,” James W. Peters, Whirlpool’s chief financial officer, said last week in a conference call.
Americans have been feeling the pain of higher prices, even if they are spending through it. A record share of people in a Gallup poll named inflation as the top U.S. economic problem, survey data released last week showed. Officials spent much of 2021 hoping that pandemic-era cost increases would fade as supply chains returned to normal. Instead, inflation has remained too high for the Fed’s comfort for a year, and it has become broader with time. A higher-than-expected jump in wage data released Friday made a second big increase in June more likely “at the margin,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

At the same time, the stock market has had a bad year. The Fed has long said it doesn’t make decisions based on the market, but clearly the recent stock rout makes raising interest rates harder. The S&P 500 fell 8.8 percent in April, and is down more than 13 percent in 2022. The drop shows many investors are coming to the same conclusion: The economy is about to take a hit, and everywhere they look, they see trouble ahead, reports The Times’s Coral Murphy Marcos. “There are definitely a lot of open-ended and unquantified risks looming,” said Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm.

Her visit to Kyiv over the weekend made her the most senior American official to go to Ukraine since Russia invaded. Separately, a British intelligence agency said that more than a quarter of the ground forces that Russia committed to the war were now most likely “combat ineffective.”
The E.U. will propose phasing out Russian oil by the end of the year. Restrictions on imports would be introduced gradually under the proposed plan. A decision about new sanctions could come as soon as this week.
Nearly a third of the S&P 500 will report earnings this week. Investors will look to Pfizer, CVS and Starbucks for signs of supply chain disruption and how consumers are responding to price increases.

Berkshire’s big weekend is back
Berkshire Hathaway, the investing conglomerate run by the billionaire and investment legend Warren Buffett, held its annual meeting in person over the weekend after a two-year pandemic hiatus. Andrew was on hand at the event, which drew thousands of people to Berkshire’s hometown, Omaha, and has this dispatch.

Warren Buffett, 91, and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger, 98, lobbed quips and retorts over the course of more than six hours onstage at what some call “Woodstock for Capitalists,” speaking and fielding questions. In the audience were Tim Cook, Jamie Dimon, Bill Gates, Bill Ackman, Mario Gabelli, Bill Murray and Glenn Close. Ken Chenault was there as a first-time board member.
The big difference this year was the presence of Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, Buffett’s successors, who sat on the dais with him and Munger for the first time. Jain was particularly Buffett-like in the straightforward and analytical way he answered questions, at one point admitting that Geico, the car insurer owned by Berkshire, had underperformed its rival Progressive, and explaining why.
The biggest news was likely that Buffett was arbitraging the Activision deal with Microsoft, betting it will happen, and had significantly increased his bet on the oil industry by buying more shares of the energy giant Chevron in the first quarter.
Here are some of the meeting’s best lines:
“Inflation swindles the bond investor too. It swindles the person who keeps their cash under their mattress. It swindles almost everybody,” Buffett said.
“If you told me you owned all the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn’t take it,” Buffett said. “Whether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don’t know. But the one thing I’m pretty sure of is that it doesn’t produce anything.”
“I try to avoid things that are stupid and evil and make me look bad. Bitcoin does all three,” Munger added.
“If I were running oil and gas for the U.S., I would leave most of the oil we have here and pay whatever the Arabs charge for their oil and conserve my own,” Munger said. “I think it’s going to be very precious stuff over the next 200 years.”
“You ought to be a better person in the second half of your life than the first half,” Buffett said.
“In December, Wood described ARKK portfolio as in ‘deep value’ territory and sent value investors worldwide into spasms of indignation. ARKK’s down another 50% since then, so deeper value-er, I guess.”
— Andrew Beer of the hedge fund tracking firm Dynamic Beta Investments, in a worth-reading tweet thread on the recent poor performance of Ark Innovation ETF, the flagship fund of the star tech-stock investor Cathie Wood.

Musk tears up the financing playbook
Elon Musk’s financing plan for his buyout of Twitter has broken all the rules. He is putting up far more of his own money than is usual in such a deal; private equity buyers typically use very little of their own cash to pay for an acquisition. Borrowing money is more standard, but Musk is borrowing a lot — $13 billion in loans would end up on Twitter’s books.
The deal may burden Twitter with more debt than it can handle, given its patchy profitability, The Times’s Anupreeta Das and DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch report in a close look at the numbers. And Musk’s push for more “free speech” on Twitter could hurt advertising income, making it harder for the company to pay off its new debt.
It is not too late for Musk to partner with other investors to reduce the amount of his own money in the deal, and this is something he is considering, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Thoma Bravo, a technology-focused buyout firm, is open to providing some financing. Apollo, an alternative asset manager, also looked at a possible deal where it would extend a loan on preferred terms.
The stakes are high for both Twitter and Tesla. Because Musk is selling Tesla shares as well as putting them up as collateral for personal loans to raise cash, Tesla’s value would be linked to Twitter’s. This is risky because any difficulties at Twitter could force Musk to sell Tesla stock and put the money into Twitter. If Tesla’s stock falls far enough, it would trigger clauses in Musk’s personal loans requiring him to add more collateral.

Will Musk’s unusual approach secure the social media network’s future, or will it end up squandering a big chunk of his fortune? That’s the question on many people’s minds, as details of the deal, which is expected to take three to six months to close, are hammered out.

2022-05-03,"Angie Chen (Emma Galbraith) trudges through multiple gray areas in “Inbetween Girl,” an intelligent teenage drama by the writer and director Mei Makino.
Half-Asian and half-white, Angie, 16, is the “token minority” student at her high school in Galveston, Texas, though she has never felt particularly Asian. Her identity crisis is exacerbated when her parents announce their divorce, and her father — who is originally from China — moves in with a Chinese woman and her Stanford-bound daughter.
Then Angie’s crush, Liam (William Magnuson) — the school heartthrob — appears outside her bedroom window. Liam’s girlfriend, Sheryl (Emily Garrett), is an Instagram model, but her Catholic beliefs frustrate his desire for physical intimacy. Liam turns to Angie instead, and though their first romp is predictably awful, they begin to carry on regular trysts in secret. The two fall into something like love.
Sheryl, it turns out, doesn’t lead the picture-perfect life Angie thinks she does, and complications ensue when Liam refuses to tell her the truth.

Amid her sexual awakening, Angie begins to grapple with feelings of guilt. Makino tracks her evolution through dreamy, meditative transitions that weave examples of Angie’s artistic output with roaming shots of Galveston. In these moments, Angie reflects on her troubles in voice-over drawn from video diary entries; they’re corny, yes, and they spell out Angie’s emotions a little too directly, but her youthful wisdom and vulnerability feel honest.
“Inbetween Girl” isn’t the only recent film to center the love life and inter-cultural hang-ups of a young Asian American woman (see “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” and “The Half of It”), but it might be the most profound. Though the dialogue is often hit-or-miss, this young adult drama doesn’t simply put a fresh spin on old tropes: It takes seriously the messiness of growing up, the hardest parts of which involve accepting life’s ambiguities.

Only Michael R. Bloomberg’s 2018 donation of $1.8 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, ranks higher.
The gift establishes the Doerrs as leading funders of climate change research and scholarship, and will place Stanford at the center of public and private efforts to wean the world off fossil fuels.
“Climate and sustainability is going to be the new computer science,” Mr. Doerr, who made his estimated $11.3 billion fortune investing in technology companies such as Slack, Google and Amazon, said in an interview. “This is what the young people want to work on with their lives, for all the right reasons.”
The school, to be known as the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, will be a home to traditional academic departments related to topics such as planetary science, energy technology and food-and-water security. It will also feature several interdisciplinary institutes and a center focused on developing practical policy and technology solutions to the climate crisis.

2022-05-05,"A show called “Bosch: Legacy” starts this week, and it is labeled Season 1. Fans of the show’s grumpy namesake and his original series can rest easy, though. In everything but name, it’s an eighth season of “Bosch.” They knew better than to mess with Harry.
There are some twists in “Legacy,” which premieres with four of its 10 episodes Friday on Freevee, the Amazon free-with-commercials service formerly known as IMDb TV. Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), the hard-boiled cop’s hard-boiled cop, is now a private detective, having left the Los Angeles Police Department in a huff as “Bosch” ended last year. And his highly determined daughter, Maddie (Madison Lintz), is now a cop, undergoing training and inspiring equal measures of pride and anxiety in her dad.
But it’s the same show, which wasn’t unexpected but still counts as a relief. It was developed by a “Bosch” writer, Tom Bernardo, and key personnel like the executive producers Eric Overmyer and Michael Connelly, author of the Bosch mystery novels, have stayed on. (Connelly wrote the season’s first episode with Overmyer and its last with Welliver.) The unhurried pace, the cleverly interlocking story lines and the general lack of pretense and contrivance remain in place. It is still, depending on your preferences, a doddering throwback or an oasis of old-school rationality and calm. (If you’re keeping score, we’re going with oasis.)
The most important holdover, of course, is Welliver, whose tightly controlled performance has made Bosch one of the most indelible television characters of the last decade. Crotchety, self-righteous and quick to anger, but also loyal, compassionate and soulful, he’s the whole hard-boiled package.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Leaving the force takes Bosch away from the squad room of colorful characters who populated the original series. But he still works his L.A.P.D. contacts, and some “Bosch” favorites have significant roles, including Gregory Scott Cummins and Troy Evans as the veteran detectives and comedy duo Crate and Barrel. Scott Klace also returns as the avuncular desk sergeant Mank, now keeping an eye on Maddie, and Jamie Hector does a flyby as Bosch’s old partner, Jerry Edgar.
At the center of the new show are Welliver, Lintz and Mimi Rogers, who’s back as the plaintiff’s lawyer Honey Chandler, Maddie’s mentor and Bosch’s sometime nemesis, sometime colleague. They’re joined by one prominent new regular, Stephen A. Chang, who is charming as Mo, a tech guy Bosch hires for bugging and surveillance jobs; he slides into Hector’s partner role and gets the plum job of making fun of Bosch for being a dinosaur.
Those four figure in the season’s web of plot lines, which can be even more elaborate now that Maddie has her own law-enforcement career. (That some of them carry over directly from “Bosch” further exposes the “new series” pretext.) The major ones include Bosch’s search for the possible heir of a dying billionaire played by William Devane; Chandler’s new troubles with the corrupt businessman who tried to have her killed in “Bosch”; her defense of a homeless man accused of killing a doctor; and two cases of Maddie’s, involving a serial rapist and a police shooting. Another beloved character, Bosch’s dramatic hillside house, is damaged in an earthquake, and its fate — if you’ll excuse the expression — hangs in the balance.
The story lines stop and start, often connect (in reasonably plausible ways) and are resolved at various points in the season, continuing a method pioneered in “Bosch” that offers some of the pleasures of the episodic crime drama with less of the reliance on formula and narrative shortcuts. There are only a few major missteps across the season’s 10 episodes, notably the introduction of an assassin who’s a little too Femme Nikita for comfort and some extraneous flashbacks to Bosch’s teenage years and his military service in Afghanistan.
Those scenes are meant to illuminate Bosch — to give us information about what drives him, in one instance, and what holds him back, in another — but they’re just distractions. We know all we need to know about him from eight seasons and counting (a ninth has already been ordered) of Welliver’s subtle, emotionally potent performance. Whatever the title, he’s the real thing."

Tight, and getting tighter
This morning, the Labor Department will report how many jobs employers added to their payrolls in April. Economists believe it was another solid month of growth. Those surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an addition of 380,000 workers. The unemployment rate is expected to decline slightly to 3.5 percent, returning to its level in February 2020, which was the lowest rate since 1969.
This would be a strong showing for the economy, but it’s not all good news. While wage gains are expected — up 5.5 percent from a year earlier,  economists predict — they have been offset by inflation, which is at its highest level since 1981. The Fed initially suggested that inflation, which began last spring, was a temporary result of the reopening of the economy after pandemic restrictions. But the surge in prices has persisted, driven by energy supply disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and coronavirus lockdowns in China.
The big question is how and when the Fed’s rate increase will affect hiring. The Fed’s move should, if all goes to plan, lead to higher financing costs, which will slow business growth. This will ultimately cause demand to slow, leading to a drop in prices. The sweet spot for the Fed is creating the conditions to ease the labor shortage, but not so much that there is an increase in unemployment. “You can see that the labor market is out of balance, you can see that there is a labor shortage,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said on Wednesday. “We’ve got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people’s wages aren’t being eaten up by inflation, and where we can have a long expansion, too.”
It could take months. People are returning to the work force , nearing prepandemic levels — just not as fast as employers want them to, writes The Times’s Ben Casselman. Even if the labor force returned fully, there wouldn’t be enough workers to meet employers’ needs, said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist for Mastercard.

Many economists expect the U.S. unemployment rate to keep declining, complicating the Fed’s efforts to bring down inflation, Bloomberg reports. A survey from the Institute for Supply Management published this week found that demand for workers remained “hypercompetitive” and that there were not enough qualified workers available. This has hit small businesses the hardest.

Exclusive: Tesla unveils new diversity efforts
Today, Tesla will make public its 2021 “impact report,” assessing, among other things, its efforts on diversity and inclusion. The results are particularly important, given that the electric vehicle maker is currently challenging a lawsuit alleging racial discrimination  at its factory in California. Tesla has argued that the state’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing is “exceeding its boundaries,”  and its lawyers have asked a California court to stay the state’s case against the company.

The report also comes amid a swath of new attention on Tesla’s C.E.O., Elon Musk, whose bid for Twitter has put a new spotlight on his political leanings. Frequently, Musk positions himself counter to progressive causes (despite championing efforts against climate change), taking aim at Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and railing against early Covid lockdown orders. But the impact report, along with figures on the racial and gender mix of the company’s employees, highlights a range of actions by the car company that progressives would likely cheer.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Tesla is covering transportation costs for employees to get out-of-state abortions, DealBook is first to report, joining the likes of Citigroup and Yelp as various state regulations have limited access to abortion. Texas, where Tesla is based, banned the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy. Legislators are already threatening actions against companies that offer such benefits, including most recently Senator Marco Rubio in Florida. Tesla’s other fertility benefits include I.V.F. and egg freezing, as well as up to $25,000 for both adoption and surrogacy. Tesla offers 16 weeks of paid family leave.
Tesla’s internal diversity numbers are better than the public narrative. In its report, the company compared its base of roughly 100,000 employees against the latest disclosures to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by technology and automotive companies, benchmarking against an average of percentages in each industry. (The tech companies included Alphabet, Amazon and Oracle, while the auto companies were General Motors and Ford.) Tesla’s employee numbers are as of the 2020 calendar year.
As a proportion of its work force, Tesla employs significantly more Hispanic or Latino employees than both its tech and auto company peers, skewing 15 percent and 19 percent above the mean, respectively.
Compared to auto companies, Tesla’s work force is behind when it comes to Black employees, dragging 11 percent. But it is 2 percent ahead compared to tech firms.
It is lagging in its inclusion of women, falling 16 percent behind compared to tech companies, and 4 percent behind auto companies.
One reason for the racial differences is the location of Tesla’s plants. The plants are in areas with a significantly higher proportion of Hispanic workers than, say, in Detroit. Tesla has programs in place, like its Returnship program, to help it hire more women. It is also working to increase its Black work force, in part by focusing on recruiting at places like historically Black colleges and universities.
“Even if he’s able to finance it, it just is not a sensible deal from a financial perspective.”

The companies that fund anti-abortion lawmakers
Abortion rights advocates are mobilizing in response to the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion that could overturn Roe v. Wade. One of their first targets: Companies that funded the campaigns of state lawmakers with anti-abortion agendas.
Many major companies have contributed to state legislators who sponsored the latest wave of anti-abortion laws. “Corporate political spending is a big part of what brought us to this moment,” Sonja Spoo of UltraViolet, a nonprofit dedicated to women’s rights that recently researched the issue, tells DealBook.
More than 110 companies gave a total of $5.4 million to legislators who sponsored laws passed in 2021 in 16 states that have restricted access to abortions.
Big spenders included AT&T, Berkshire Hathaway, Comcast and General Motors. (All four companies did not respond to DealBook’s requests for comment on the issue.)
“We’re not saying the companies are anti-abortion. Often they are supporting a politician for business purposes,” Spoo noted. “But as companies increasingly tout their values, they can’t be funding the erosion of rights.”
Disney is one company where corporate spending has not matched public statements. In 2019, Disney C.E.O. Bob Iger said a new abortion law in Georgia might force the company to stop filming there. But in Florida, Disney’s political spending “heavily favors” politicians who support abortion restrictions, UltraViolet’s research shows. Last month, Florida passed a restrictive abortion law similar to the Mississippi law under consideration at the Supreme Court. Disney, which recently lost its special tax status in the state amid a fight over legislation that puts a limit on gender identity discussion in schools, has been silent in the wake of the leaked draft  opinion, like many other companies.
Advocates say  other rights could fall next if the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the leaked opinion is extended. Politicians pushing abortion restrictions are also advancing laws limiting ballot access. “This is a tipping point for rolling back so many rights,” Kelley Robinson, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told reporters yesterday, announcing a day of nationwide protests on May 14.

Must companies pick a side? The leaked opinion has prompted more companies to consider covering workers’ expenses for out-of-state abortions, and some lawmakers want to make such benefits illegal. “Companies are going to be forced to choose,” UltraViolet’s Spoo said. “This is a place of their own making.”

A little more than a decade ago, workers started increasingly raising their hands and voices against company policies. Since then, employee activism has been a cultural phenomenon that has demanded that business leaders not only take a strong, public stand on a political issue — something companies assiduously avoided in previous decades — but also take real action.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Then, last month, Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor in Florida, took action that threatened to derail that movement: Angry that Bob Chapek, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, had spoken out against a Florida law called the Parental Rights in Education act or, by its critics, the “Don’t Say Gay” law, the governor retaliated. In a special session of the Legislature, Mr. DeSantis rammed through a bill to strip Disney, one of the largest private employers in Florida, of the autonomous district that it had managed near Orlando for 55 years.
And this week, Politico published a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion showing a majority of the justices voting to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that made abortion a constitutional right in the United States. There isn’t an issue in American politics more incendiary than abortion, and with some 60 to 70 percent of Americans in favor of retaining Roe, it seems there would be increasing pressure on corporate executives to take a stance in favor of abortion rights.
In this case, however, there is likely to be a countervailing pressure that will be hard to ignore. Thirteen states have passed so-called trigger laws that will effectively ban or curtail abortion access almost immediately if Roe is overturned. Another dozen or so are poised to follow the same path. Virtually all of these are red states, led by governors who no doubt saw what Mr. DeSantis did to Disney. In retrospect, following the lead of employees in standing up for climate action, racial justice and the #MeToo movement was a no-brainer for corporations compared with taking a public position on abortion.
A movement in turbulent times
When the term “employee activism” started to gain popularity in the early 2010s, young workers — millennials usually with white-collar jobs — led the charge. They were fed up with both corporate greed and corporate indifference to issues they cared about. Millennials are now between the ages of 26 and 41, and they make up a large proportion of corporate employees.
“Millennials lean liberal, by an almost two-to-one margin over previous generations,” said Charlotte Alter, the author of “The Ones We’ve Been Waiting For,” a book about the millennial generation. “They want to work for companies that align with their values. And they understand how much power they have in the system. They see their job as a lever they can pull.”

It’s not hard to suss out the reasons that employee activism started to rise. With the government seemingly incapable of action on complex issues that affect the lives of Americans, employees started turning to their companies as institutions with the money and clout to affect change. Companies have financial power, and when they threaten to take action on a political issue, they can get results.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The best example of this was in 2017 when united business opposition, stoked by employees, prevented a number of state legislatures from passing bills that would have restricted transgender people from using bathrooms that matched their gender identity. North Carolina, which did pass such a law, known as the “bathroom bill,” wound up rolling back some of it after pushback from businesses.
Another example took place in 2020 when an employee walkout pushed the publishing giant Hachette to cancel plans to publish Woody Allen’s autobiography a month before it was supposed to hit bookshelves.
Abortion, Inc.
When I asked Ms. Alter whether she thought millennials were worried about losing their jobs for being too outspoken, she said: “If employees are calling for more diversity in their company, are they really going to be fired?” On the contrary: It’s the companies that have to worry about losing valuable workers if they don’t align with them politically.
Business leaders I spoke with were convinced that abortion was likely to generate a wave of employee activism that dwarfed anything that had come before.

Anne Marie Squeo, a former corporate communications chief who now runs Proof Point Communications, said: “The days of ‘We can ignore it’ are over.”
Judy Samuelson, the executive director of the Aspen Institute Business and Society Program, agreed. In an email to me, she wrote: “As Levi Strauss — one company that has already spoken out — points out, women make up most of the employees in the work force (at Levi Strauss that number is 68 percent) and this will be personal. Women stepped up on #MeToo — but this is an even more universal and an even greater threat to what we have taken for granted — the right of women to fully engage in the economy and to secure their family’s economic future.”
As Ms. Samuelson pointed out, some companies have already made it clear they won’t sit on the sidelines, especially in states, like Texas, that have passed laws banning abortions after six weeks. Citigroup, Apple, Yelp, Levi Strauss, Amazon and Tesla have announced plans to pay travel expenses for employees who have to leave their state to find an abortion provider. Last year, Salesforce told its employees in Texas that it would resettle them elsewhere after the state passed its restrictive abortion law. Bank of America’s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told CBS News on Wednesday that, in his view, Roe v. Wade was “settled law.” He added that the company would meet with employees to decide on a course of action.
But it’s also hard to ignore that this time feels different somehow. Many chief executives seem skittish about speaking out. In fact, some of them seem terrified. It is hard to know at this early stage what other action corporate America may take besides helping to cover costs for employees who need to travel out of state for abortion access.

It’s equally hard to know how and whether red-state governments will try to retaliate, the way Mr. DeSantis did, against companies that speak out. Or whether employees from red states even want their employers to take a stand. What is very clear, however, is that the debate is just starting, and business can’t ever be usual again.

What’s Up? (May 1-7)
U.S. Regains Most of Jobs Lost in Pandemic
The Labor Department reported another solid month of job growth in April on Friday. U.S. employers added 428,000 jobs, the department said, the same as the revised figure for March. The unemployment rate in April remained at 3.6 percent. The United States has regained nearly 95 percent of the 22 million jobs lost at the height of pandemic lockdowns. Employers’ scramble for workers as the economy has recovered helped push up wages — the April survey showed average hourly earnings 5.5 percent higher than a year earlier — but those gains for workers have been largely offset by a surge in prices. The labor supply has not kept up with job openings, and the labor force shrank unexpectedly in April.
A Big Rate Increase
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by half a percentage point, the largest increase since 2000, and detailed a plan to shrink its huge bond holdings — decisive measures aimed at cooling rapid inflation. The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, said half-percentage point increases were “on the table” for upcoming meetings, but he shot down the idea that policymakers were considering an even larger move. The Fed’s move came after the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation — showed that prices climbed 6.6 percent in the year through March, the quickest pace of increase since 1982.
Investors Join Musk’s Twitter Deal
The billionaire mogul Elon Musk revealed on Thursday that he had raised around $7 billion from 18 entities to help fund his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. The investors came from a mix of Mr. Musk’s Silicon Valley connections — including venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and tech moguls like Larry Ellison of Oracle — as well as cryptocurrency companies, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, property firms and mutual-fund companies, the filing showed. The new funding commitments were a sign that Mr. Musk, who leads the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, was still figuring out his plans for Twitter after striking a deal on April 25 to buy the company. It had been unclear how Mr. Musk would carry out his financing plans, which included $21 billion of his own cash and a $12.5 billion loan against his shares in Tesla. The new commitments reduce the size of the loan against those shares.

What’s Next? (May 8-14)
A Turbulent Stock Market
The stock market’s gyrations have become more dramatic than usual. Even though markets rallied after the Federal Reserve increased rates on Wednesday, they plunged on Thursday, highlighting Wall Street’s worries about what the Fed’s campaign to slow inflation will mean for the economy. The S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent on Thursday, following a gain of 3 percent on Wednesday. The plunge dashed hopes of a quick recovery after April proved to be Wall Street’s worst month since March 2020. The Nasdaq composite slid 5 percent, its biggest drop since June 2020. Yields on government bonds spiked, with the rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, a benchmark for borrowing costs across the economy, climbing above 3 percent and touching its highest level since 2018.

The Latest on Inflation
The Consumer Price Index for April — the Labor Department’s monthly report on prices for goods and services — is coming out on Wednesday. Economists will be watching to see if the numbers indicate that the nation’s inflation crisis shows signs of peaking. Last month, the report showed that prices were 8.5 percent higher in March than a year earlier, the fastest 12-month pace since 1981. A jump in gasoline prices tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rising costs for food and rent and strong demand all contributed.
The Electric Car Market
Rivian, a potential competitor for the electric carmaker Tesla, will announce its earnings for the first three months of this year on Wednesday. After some production challenges — with Rivian paring down delivery targets for the year — amid a time of global supply chain turmoil, the earnings report may show whether the company is bouncing back. Both Amazon and Ford reported that they had lost billions of dollars in the first three months of the year after the value of their stakes in Rivian plunged. Rivian, which makes a high-end truck and sport utility vehicle, had faced a backlash after it announced a 20 percent price increase on two of its vehicles, a decision it then walked back.
What Else?
The energy giant Shell on Thursday reported its biggest ever quarterly profit, and BP on Tuesday reported its highest profit in a decade, reflecting surging prices for oil and natural gas. The Amazon Labor Union lost its vote at a second Staten Island warehouse, after winning a landmark victory last month at a larger Amazon facility nearby. The stationary bike maker Peloton, an early pandemic winner that lost steam as people returned to gyms, will report earnings this week."
2022-05-09,"As I read the U.S. Supreme Court’s draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, I was devastated. It was shocking to see, laid out in cold legalese, the blatant ideological reasoning gutting the constitutional right to abortion.
I understand the frustration that many are feeling. I feel it too. Roe has been the law of the land for 49 years, nearly my entire lifetime. But it may not be the law of the land for my daughters. Many of us feared this day would come, which is why last month I filed a lawsuit and, drawing on authority granted to me as governor, asked the Michigan Supreme Court to immediately resolve whether our State Constitution includes the right to gain access to abortion.
As a woman born and raised in Michigan, I have a moral obligation to stand up for the rights of the nearly 2.2 million Michigan women who will lose their right to make decisions about their own bodies if Roe falls. Michigan, like several other states, has a law criminalizing abortion that is still on the books. It was enacted in 1931 and would make our state home to one of the most extreme anti-choice policies in the country once this decision from the court is officially released. If Roe falls, abortion will become a felony in Michigan, without exceptions for rape or incest.
My argument is predicated on the due process and equal protection clauses in our State Constitution. The due process clause of the Michigan Constitution protects the right to abortion in the same way that the United States Constitution does per Roe, and the equal protection clause prohibits the state from adopting laws based on paternalistic justifications and overbroad generalizations about the role of women in the work force and at home. Other state constitutions, including the constitutions of Kansas, Montana, Alaska and Florida, have already been interpreted to protect the right to abortion.
I hope that my novel lawsuit can offer a course of action for others to follow. I encourage my fellow pro-choice governors, state legislators, private sector leaders and citizens to use every available tool to protect access to safe, legal abortions. Given that Michigan has a Republican-controlled legislature,I am not optimistic that I — as a pro-choice Democratic governor — can get a bill passed to overturn the 1931 Michigan law.

Those in states where abortion is already protected at the state level, and where it will remain accessible if Roe falls, may feel protected. There is, however, a very real danger that in a few short years, with complete control of the federal levers of power, anti-choice, anti-women extremists could enact a federal abortion ban, which could abolish abortion nationally, regardless of state law. This is not theoretical — it is their endgame.

Dueling ideas about free speech
The Supreme Court yesterday blocked a Texas law aimed at stopping what its supporters called censorship of conservative voices by online platforms. Tech companies said the law violated their First Amendment rights and limited their ability to moderate content.
The court granted an emergency request to block the law from trade associations representing major tech companies like Facebook and Twitter. The speedy 5-to-4 decision does not necessarily mean that the justices would ultimately agree with the tech industry’s claims in a full review. But it does mean that a majority disagreed with an appeals court ruling last month that allowed the law to go into effect while challenges were pending.
This is a fight over competing visions of free speech. The Texas law, H.B. 20, bans platforms with more than 50 million active monthly users from removing posts based on the views they express, even if they violate the companies’ content moderation policies. The decision yesterday gave the tech industry groups NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association another temporary win, but there is a long legal road ahead.
“While today’s victory is welcome news, we’re only halfway there,” NetChoice’s policy counsel, Chris Marchese, said in a statement on the ruling. Lower courts will decide on the legal issues. And appeals are very likely to follow because the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, and the tech companies appear similarly determined to win.

The Supreme Court may end up reviewing the issues in full. First Amendment experts generally agree that the government cannot tell private companies how to handle speech or content on their platforms, and the law on this appears well settled. But the Texas situation is raising questions. A majority of justices issued a terse decision on the emergency petition that did not address the constitutional claims. But Justice Samuel Alito, joined by his colleagues Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, dissented at length, suggesting that they may be willing to rethink what seemed like fixed principles. That makes this dissent both surprising and significant, said Genevieve Lakier, an expert on the First Amendment at the University of Chicago Law School.
Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, noted only that she would deny the tech companies’ request. Some observers suspect that this was because she did not want a case from the court’s shadow docket — where decisions are made quickly and with minimal process — to disrupt the status quo, and that it was not a reflection on the constitutionality of the Texas law.

Another whack for SPACs
A crackdown on the public shell firms known as special purpose acquisition companies that began at the S.E.C. has reached Congress, and new legislation is in progress. The companies, SPACs, are formed to acquire a business and list it with less fuss than a traditional I.P.O. But some officials say the hastier and hazier SPAC process favors insiders and financial institutions, while incentivizing bad deals that leave retail investors with losses.
“SPACs and SPAC sponsors are abusing loopholes and gaps in current securities law,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, argues in a report released yesterday. The report calls for a law that would codify rules proposed by the S.E.C. in March — and go further, with more disclosures and added liability for major players.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Warren and the S.E.C. are focusing on “evening the playing field” between SPACs and I.P.O.s. Her report points to several major issues with SPACs, including:
The “promote”: SPAC sponsors pay a fraction of market value for a 20 percent share in the company, ensuring a profit regardless of deal quality.
Shortcuts: Institutional investors get early information and discounted stock.
Hidden costs: SPAC transaction fees outstrip those of a traditional I.P.O.
Information gaps: Claims made in SPAC disclosures can be misleading because the requirements surrounding them are lax.
Looming scrutiny has contributed to SPACs’ fading luster. The S.E.C.’s plan is still open for public comment, but it has already chilled enthusiasm amid a wider market downturn. Forbes just scrapped its SPAC plans. Goldman Sachs is shrinking its SPAC business. More than 600 SPACs raised some $160 billion last year, according to SPAC Research, while about 50 blank-check firms raised $10 billion in the first quarter of 2022, and activity this spring is down substantially compared with the last.
Who supports a new law? A spokeswoman for Warren told DealBook that it was too early to name potential co-sponsors, and that guarding against SPAC abuses is popular across the political spectrum. But given Republican resistance to the S.E.C. rule-making agenda, divisions in Congress and a possible reshuffling after midterm elections, SPACs seem an unlikely priority.
Coinbase takes heat over fees
Coinbase will hold the second annual shareholder meeting in its brief history as a public company today. Expect some unhappiness from investors. The crypto exchange’s stock price has fallen to just over $78, from $357 in November. One of the problems: Coinbase charges its customers relatively high fees, compared with other more traditional stock brokerage or banking services. As crypto matures, those fees are likely to come down, leaving Coinbase’s profits vulnerable.
Coinbase’s high fees have received some attention lately. The short seller Jim Chanos said recently on a crypto podcast that the fee issue was one of the main reasons he started betting against the company this year. In the first half of last year, Coinbase generated fees equal to about 4 percent of its assets under management, on an annualized basis. Chanos said those fees were “stunning,” noting that brokers like Charles Schwab earned “a fraction of that.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The company’s fees are already falling. In the first quarter, Coinbase’s overall revenue fell by nearly 30 percent from a year ago, and now equates to less than 2 percent annualized of its client’s assets. Chanos predicts Coinbase’s fees will continue to fall, especially as competition heats up. Online reviews say Coinbase has higher and more confusing fees than rival crypto exchanges. But those same reviews say Coinbase is easier to use, potentially justifying the higher fees.
Coinbase says its fees are not under pressure. When asked about fees, a company spokesman pointed to recent comments by Coinbase’s C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, who attributed the company’s falling revenue to a drop in transactions, not a change in its fee structure. “We’re not seeing competition on fees,” Armstrong said. But he also said the company was testing a new flat-fee monthly subscription service, as well as other new offerings. What’s more, he said more than half of Coinbase’s clients were using the service for more than just transactions, making Coinbase more akin to a primary financial account than a trading platform.
“It starts with a simple proposition: Respect the Fed, respect the Fed’s independence, which I have done and will continue to do.”

Is it legal to seize Russia’s money?
The White House, which led the initial push to generate consensus around sanctions on Russia, has been reluctant to join an effort to seize more than $300 billion worth of Russian assets to help with the rebuilding of Ukraine.
That movement is being led by a number of leaders from Europe as well as Canada. The confiscated assets — mostly foreign currency reserves from Russia’s central bank held in European banks — would be put into a fund to assist Ukrainian cities and towns devastated by the war, The Times’s Alan Rappeport and David Sanger report.
There is a dispute over whether U.S. law allows seizures of Russian assets. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the U.S. can’t legally participate in this plan. Some legal scholars disagree. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the president was given expanded powers to claim international assets. But the Biden administration would have to determine that Russia poses a certain threat to America. Past asset seizures involving Venezuela, Iran and most recently Afghanistan were considered legal, officials say, because the U.S. didn’t recognize the countries’ governments as legitimate.
Biden officials worry more seizures could weaken the dollar. Other nations like China are reluctant to keep their reserves in dollars for fear that they might be seized. That could hurt the currency’s value and America’s ability to borrow. Economists are concerned that the dollar could be replaced by the Chinese renminbi, or maybe even Bitcoin, as the world’s go-to reserve currency.

2022-06-02,"The recent travails of Netflix, and the tech sector in general, have served notice that the abundance of new series that you have gotten used to — and perhaps grown tired of — may not last forever. But if it turns out that this summer represented the beginning of the end, it will have been an impressive going-away party.
The big news is the arrival, within two weeks of each other, of the heavily anticipated prequel series “House of the Dragon” (taking place in the world of “Game of Thrones”) and “Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.” But outside the universe of blockbuster fantasy-franchise extensions, there’s plenty to look forward to. Some of TV’s best comedies, like “Reservation Dogs” and “What We Do in the Shadows,” return; the creators of “The Americans” and “American Vandal” present new series; and the Albuquerque fun ride “Better Call Saul” reaches its finale.
And just when you thought there were no more acting-legend-comes-to-TV moments to be had, there’s Jeff Bridges starring in a series, “The Old Man,” for the first time. TV continues to be too much of a pretty good thing — here are 27 shows to check out this summer, arranged in chronological order by premiere date. (This list includes spoilers for some shows’ earlier seasons.)

2022-06-03,"American employers extended an impressive run of hiring in May, even as policymakers took steps to cool the economy in an effort to ease high inflation.
The Labor Department reported Friday that employers added 390,000 jobs, the 17th straight monthly gain. The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent for the third straight month, a touch away from a half-century low.
At the same time, the labor force grew by 330,000 people, and the share of adults employed or looking for work continued to edge closer to prepandemic levels.
The data signaled that the Federal Reserve’s initial moves to dial back its monetary support for the economy were — at least so far — not constraining business activity so much that hiring was feeling a pinch.

After the strong rebound from the depths of the coronavirus lockdowns — all but 800,000 of the 22 million jobs that were lost have been recovered — the Fed has shifted its emphasis from maximum employment to its other mandate: price stability. The challenge is to apply its primary tool, a steady series of interest-rate increases, without inflicting a recession.
“I think we’re on sort of what looks like a glide path right now, and that’s good — nothing’s broken,” said Guy Berger, the principal economist at the career-focused social network LinkedIn. “But keep fast-forwarding it a year and the question marks are still big.”
The closely watched indicators include the impact on wages, which have been increasing at a pace not seen in decades, though not enough to keep up with inflation over the past year. The Fed is worried that rising labor costs will be passed along to consumers.
Wages kept rising across industries.

On that score, the Labor Department report showed little change in trajectory. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent from the previous month, the same pace as in April, and were 5.2 percent higher than a year earlier, compared with a 5.5 percent year-over-year increase in April.

“It’s moderating, but it’s not moderating to a level, I think, where it’s consistent with the Fed’s inflation goals,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, said of wage growth. He said the Fed would probably want wages to cool toward an annualized 3.5 percent pace, at the higher end, a rate that officials view as aligned with 2 percent inflation.
President Biden gave a nuanced celebration of the jobs data in remarks on Friday, emphasizing recent gains while arguing that a slowdown would be welcome, allowing inflation to ease.
“The point is this: We’ve laid an economic foundation that’s historically strong,” Mr. Biden said. “Now we’re moving forward to a new moment, where we can build on that foundation, build a future of stable, steady growth so that we can bring down inflation without sacrificing all of the historic gains that we have made.”
Stocks declined on Friday and bond yields rose as investors evidently read the report as reinforcing the Fed’s muscular efforts, which risk denting economic growth. “The better the data, the more difficult that a pause or reduced pace of tightening later this year becomes,” analysts at TD Securities wrote in a research report published after the jobs numbers were released.
The continued job gains are among many indications of a vibrant economy. Reports from the nation’s largest banks show checking accounts are still above 2019 levels for nearly all income groups. New bankruptcies and debt-collection proceedings are both at their lowest levels since tracking began in 1999.

Yet those encouraging trends have been at odds with the generally sour national mood, dominated by inflation concerns. U.S. consumer sentiment declined in early May to the lowest since 2011, according to the University of Michigan.

And with a potential change in the economic cycle, economic security is not evenly distributed among households. If tightening financial conditions prompt businesses to downsize, research shows that “last hired” workers will typically be the “first fired” — and that Black and Hispanic workers and those with less education are particularly vulnerable.
But a broad range of economists and policymakers, including Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, stress that more modest wage gains when paired with milder prices will be more sustainable for all workers, who are also consumers, in the long run.
“The Fed at this point is saying, look, we’d rather head off inflationary pressures, because if we have to slam on the brakes, then we’re going to cause a recession and it will be worse for these underserved communities,” said Gerald Cohen, an economist at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina. “It’s a challenge, because they want to pull people into the labor force. They know the way to do that is through higher wages. But higher wages can also breed higher inflation.”

For employers, too, the prospective change in the economic picture may not be spread evenly.
“Businesses with high profitability, easy access to capital, the capacity to automate and pricing power are still eager to hire,” said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, a large commercial bank based in Texas. “But businesses that are seeing their margins squeezed by rising costs, like hospitality, or that are seeing demand soften, like retail, are pulling job postings as their outlook softens. And competition for workers is squeezing lower-paying employers out of the job market.”
Richard Canny, the president of Ultimation in Roseville, Mich., is feeling that squeeze. His company’s conveyor belts and simple robots for use in warehousing and distribution sold briskly during the tight labor market, as e-commerce companies sought to make each worker more productive.
With 45 employees, Mr. Canny said, Ultimation has managed to stay at full staffing by raising wages — to $17 to $18 an hour to start, from around $13 to $15 — as well as offering perks like parental leave and partial tuition reimbursement. His white-collar employees have retained the flexibility to work from home. All that, he said, is necessary to compete with big employers in the area like Amazon.
“Small companies historically haven’t had to offer the same kind of benefits as the large ones, but I think that’s changed since Covid,” Mr. Canny said.

At this point in the recovery, labor- and business-oriented economists alike believe that expanding the supply of labor may be even more important than jobs gains themselves.

There are nearly two openings for every job seeker, and several factors are unlikely to change in the near term. Some, like the large cohort of retiring baby boomers, are simply demographic.
More opportunities for women could be part of the answer. Employment of women was up 181,000 in May, yet more than 700,000 below the level in February 2020.
That lag may stem, in part, from the lapse of last year’s child tax credit expansion, argued Elizabeth Ananat, a professor of women and economics at Barnard College, who has researched the program’s effects on parental employment and labor force participation.
The credit gave most families monthly payments of up to $250 per older child and $300 per young child, “helping families weather both inflation and the not-fully-recovered job market, leading to our biggest-ever cuts in poverty for families,” Ms. Ananat said. For families with a child under 5, she said, a quarter of the credit was being spent on child care.

Summer Seay, 34, of Chattanooga, Tenn., worked as a senior customer service representative at Cigna, the health insurer, throughout the pandemic, making $23 an hour. But she left in late April to spend more time caring for her three children while assisting her husband with “more of the paperwork” for the family’s wooden pallet business.
One reason she decided to leave the wage-earning work force was frustration that much of her pay was merely covering child care costs, which had mounted to $700 a week just as the expanded child tax credit expired.
“It kind of went hand in hand,” she said. “Because our big thing is food, feeding the kids.”
Another missing element of the work force are recent immigrants. Goldman Sachs researchers said recently that because of visa restrictions and health protocols during 2020 and 2021, the total number of workers was about 1.6 million below where it would be otherwise. Legal immigration rates and refugee admissions have returned to prepandemic levels under the Biden administration, the analysts found, but are not enough to make up the difference.

2022-06-04,"SUTTON, England — The days were short, and so much colder than the ones they had known, when Eric Wong and his family set foot in London in the winter of 2020 to start new lives.
In Hong Kong, Mr. Wong had been an owner of a successful business selling milk tea, and his wife had been a school administrator. In England, as a coronavirus lockdown stretched on, he played with their daughter, Trini, in their apartment and worried that his English was too poor to get him a job. It was difficult to make friends. And he missed the sun.
“I couldn’t see the direction in front of me,” said Mr. Wong, 46, who was a beneficiary of a visa program that gives British overseas passport holders in Hong Kong a path to citizenship. “Nothing was clear.”

A year and a half later, Mr. Wong has found his footing and is doing what he likes best: making and selling Hong Kong-style milk tea — which he hopes will gain traction in this country of tea drinkers — and bringing a taste of home for newcomers from Hong Kong who have taken advantage of the new visa program.

Britain has called the program a humanitarian, post-colonial responsibility after a crackdown in Hong Kong by the Chinese government, saying that Beijing is violating the terms of a handover agreement in 1997 that would leave the former British colony untouched politically.
From bustling cities like Birmingham in the Midlands to vibrant towns like Kingston, south of London, tens of thousands of people from Hong Kong have spent the past year searching for jobs and new homes. They have settled into fast-growing communities of other people from Hong Kong, a comfort for many, but at the cost of leaving behind a city where they had once hoped to grow old with their children, often having to say painful farewells to loved ones.
“You grow up in a place, and you don’t recognize it. It becomes a stranger,” Mr. Wong said on a recent afternoon, reflecting on the changes in Hong Kong as he mixed evaporated milk into a kettle of steaming tea. “When we think of it, we just want to cry.”
He said that he had been forced to leave his ailing father behind in Hong Kong, but that concern for the future of his 4-year-old daughter, after whom he has named his new business in England, had trumped other concerns. “People say I brought Trini to England,” he said, “but I think of it as the opposite: Trini brought me here.”

There, former firefighters from Hong Kong drive Amazon delivery trucks as they plan their next moves. Old school friends bump into one another on Sutton’s streets. Others attended campaign events together in the lead up to local elections, buoyed by the novelty of being eligible to cast ballots in England, even as the democratic process narrows in Hong Kong.
“It has changed the face of our cultural mix in Sutton, which is wonderful,” said Hannah Miles, an assistant pastor at a local church, speaking of the new arrivals. “We should take this opportunity to make these people feel like family.”
So far, the newcomers there say they have felt welcome.
Before Kago Ng, a former designer, arrived in London last year with her husband and 4-year-old son, Kaspar, she said she wept every night, worrying that they would not find jobs or like the city. “They said in the U.K., we would be second-class citizens, but in Hong Kong we did not feel like first-class citizens,” she said, referring to sentiments they had read online and in the news.

London, Ms. Ng said, has been much better than she imagined. She is taking on some freelance work and staying at home to care for Kaspar, while her husband has found a job repairing watches for Rolex.
But like many others, Ms. Ng worries about a backlash. Housing prices in the area, like elsewhere in a good deal of Britain, have risen during the pandemic, and it is difficult for children to find coveted places in one of the neighborhood’s schools, she said.
“Maybe the local people will think we will dilute the resources,” said Ms. Ng, as she played with Kaspar in their apartment before a dinner of hot pot, a popular meal in Hong Kong. Her brow furrowed with worry. “Maybe they will hate us.”
Settling into their new lives in England has not been without its challenges.

Pro-democracy groups from Hong Kong have organized protests in British cities, but they say they are regularly harangued online by supporters of Beijing. Some people from Hong Kong fear speaking publicly about their political views and say they avoid restaurants where the menu is in the simplified Chinese used in the mainland.
People from Hong Kong have a strong sense of identity that is very distinct from people from mainland China, said Richard Choi, a Sutton community leader.
As part of a broad effort to help newcomers settle in, the Rev. Kan Yu, a minister who immigrated from Hong Kong two decades ago, recently started a church service for people from the city to gather. “I wanted to be there to walk alongside them,” she said.

David Wong, a cellist who played beside pro-democracy protesters on the street during demonstrations in 2014, said he liked the sense of community and support he had found in Sutton. He often encourages Mr. Wong, the tea maker, to practice his English more.

“If you don’t connect with each other and help each other and do things for each other — what do you do?” he said.
The two strangers became friendly when they were neighbors living in the same residential tower.
“We feel this is Hong Kong — the community is here,” said Mr. Wong, the cellist. “Wherever I am is Hong Kong.”

2022-06-05,"Anthony Rizzo didn’t skip a beat when asked if he could spare a few minutes to talk by his locker Sunday morning.
“I have a game in a half-hour,” Rizzo, the Yankees first baseman, said, as if to deny the interview request. But Rizzo cracked a smile, revealing a light mood with his team having an unusual 11:35 a.m. start at home against the Detroit Tigers because of Major League Baseball’s streaming deal with Peacock.
While Rizzo was exaggerating — the exchange took place at 9:55 a.m. — some Yankees took a little while to adjust to the early start of what ended up being a 5-4 Yankees win in extra innings.

Rizzo guessed he was 10 years old the last time he played a game so early, while outfielder Joey Gallo estimated he had not since high school. Shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa, catcher Jose Trevino and the right-hander Michael King could not recall playing so early since at least their time in the minor leagues.
“That was a little nuts,” King said, remembering games in the Florida State League that were billed as Kids Day promotions, “because you’ve got like a bunch of fifth graders screaming at you at 10:30 in the morning.”
Sunday’s crowd, which totaled 38,030 people, also featured plenty of children, with many sporting Little League uniforms. While empty seats were easy to find, the crowd’s volume rose to solid levels during the game’s more important moments, like when the struggling Gallo hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the fifth inning — which began around 1 p.m. — and when Rizzo tied the game in the bottom of the eighth by scoring from third on an infield dribbler.

The Yankees mostly took the atypical scheduling in stride. “It’s weird,” Rizzo said. “It’s obviously not all the time, so you just do it.” Added Trevino: “I don’t care. I’m playing baseball.”

Manager Aaron Boone said after the victory: “I felt like the energy was really good this morning. I didn’t hear any complaining or anything like that. Any reservations they had, they masked it well.”
Several Yankees said they did not have to change much in the way of their pregame habits, beyond setting an earlier alarm. But the left-hander Jordan Montgomery, Sunday’s starter, said he had to do “a little extra to make sure I was loose” before tossing six and two-thirds innings of two-run ball.
Kiner-Falefa, on the other hand, gave a resounding “yes” when asked if the 11:35 a.m. start impacted his pregame routine. “Pretty much everything,” he said, adding that his commute to the ballpark, normally 15 minutes, took an hour. “Traffic was brutal,” Kiner-Falefa continued, though he was not one of the many who were likely impeded by the lower level of the George Washington Bridge being closed for a charity event, which the Yankees warned fans about with a tweet Saturday.
Even if some players did not love the early start, it came with a silver lining.
“At the present moment, not great,” reliever Lucas Luetge said when asked for his opinion. “After the game, it’ll be awesome. We’ll have the whole day to ourselves going into an off day.”

That fact was not lost on the Yankees, who finished playing at 3:04 p.m., after Josh Donaldson hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the 10th inning.

Luetge had plans to spend time with family, while Rizzo anticipated a night of relaxation. Trevino was thinking about pizza hopping around the city — Joe’s Pizza and a few Bronx joints were on his to-do list — and King had 5:30 p.m. dinner reservations with his girlfriend in SoHo.
“I don’t think I’d ever get to a 5:30 reservation on a normal 1 p.m. game,” King said.
The “chance to exhale a little bit,” as Boone put it, was a welcome one for the Yankees. The team decided it would wait until its Monday off day to fly to Minnesota, the site of the team’s next series.
The game also gave fans the chance for a unique experience.
“This game time is allowing my entire family to join me and make a big Sunday brunch event of it all,” said a season-ticket holder, Adony A. Batista, before echoing sentiments shared by Yankees players. “The game will be over, and I still have a full afternoon left!”
Watching on TV, though, was more complicated, as the game was available only on Peacock, NBC Universal’s paid streaming service. Before the season, Major League Baseball and NBC agreed to a new, 18-game Sunday morning package.

Convenience was an issue for some, as not every household pays for Peacock, and the broadcast lagged behind Twitter updates and online game feeds. Some resorted to watching the game on illegal streams, rather than on Peacock, but many were receptive to the broadcast itself, citing the unique nature of having an analyst from each team.
While the Yankees are not scheduled for another Peacock stream, their 2022 docket features more than a few games that are not on their regional YES Network. A deal with Amazon Prime accounts for 21 games, and the team has made two appearances on Apple TV+ because of another M.L.B. deal. With other national broadcast partners like ESPN and Fox taking up a handful of games, only 128 Yankees games were slated for YES this season, per the team’s online schedule.
It is part of M.L.B.’s long-term strategy to gain viewers by experimenting with alternative outlets.

“Both the Apple deal and the Peacock deal are really important to us, on the issue of reach,” Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a meeting with sports editors at M.L.B.’s headquarters in Manhattan last month. “I think that they are steppingstones to hopefully more involvement by those two companies in our local broadcasting situation. We do feel that streaming is the most viable alternative we have to improve our reach.”
Only the Peacock games, however, come with early start times. The idea is reminiscent of the N.F.L.’s games in London, which give American football die-hards a chance to wake up to their favorite sport at 9 a.m. Under Peacock’s format, baseball fans now have a similar opportunity on Sunday mornings.
Baseball players will just need to adapt on occasion.
“They get to wake up and there’s baseball on right away,” Luetge said. “I think it’s good. It’s a wrinkle, but it’s just one game.”

A difficult choice in Ukraine’s east
As Ukraine’s army fights to hold defensive positions in the Donbas region in the face of an unrelenting Russian bombardment, its military leaders face an impossible choice.
On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky called Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk “dead cities,” nearly empty of civilians. Withdrawing forces from frontline cities would save lives: Moscow has surrounded Sievierodonetsk from three sides.
But Sievierodonetsk is Ukraine’s last stand in the entire Luhansk region, which is part of the Donbas. And Zelensky said that Russia could launch “constant missile strikes on the center of Ukraine” if it took control of the Donbas. That could make future attempts to retake territory even more costly. Here are live updates.
Toll: Ukraine said that more than 40,000 of its civilians have been killed or wounded since the war began and that roughly three million live under Russian occupation.

Mariupol: The fate of the Russian-occupied city is close to mind for Ukrainian leaders. After vowing to fight, around 2,500 fighters eventually had to surrender to Russian custody. Dozens died. Now, sewage systems are not working, dead bodies are rotting in the streets and tens of thousands lack access to clean water.
Artillery: Powerful Western weapons systems may already be having an effect in the Black Sea: Ukraine’s navy said that Russian warships had pulled back more than 70 miles from the coast after Harpoon anti-ship missile systems arrived from Denmark.

Israel’s government in crisis again
The Israeli Parliament voted against applying Israeli civilian law to Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, a move that could topple the fragile coalition government.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The decision on Monday undermined the two-tier legal system that governs the 61 percent of the West Bank that falls under direct Israeli control. There, Israelis live under civilian law, while Palestinians generally live under military law.
Israel first enforced the two-tier system after its 1967 occupation of the West Bank, and lawmakers have easily extended it every half decade since. The system is at the heart of accusations that Israel operates an apartheidlike system in the West Bank.
Details: The vote failed because of dissent from leftist and Arab lawmakers in the coalition — as well as right-wing opposition lawmakers who support Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister who is on trial for corruption, and see an opportunity to break apart the current government.
Analysis: If some lawmakers do not change course by the end of June, the move could topple Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s government. Analysts say a Netanyahu government would be one of the most right-wing in Israeli history.
What’s next: Officials and legal experts said that a failure to extend the legislation would create “chaos” and upend daily life in the West Bank.

Details emerge from Bangladesh explosion
Firefighters did not know that there were chemical drums at a shipping container depot in Bangladesh when they responded to a fire over the weekend, an official said.
The chemicals set off a series of powerful explosions. Nine firefighters were among at least 41 people killed. Hundreds of other people suffered burns. The depot held clothing ready for export and drums filled with hydrogen peroxide, which is often used to bleach and dye fabric.
“When our first team arrived here to douse the fire, the authority did not tell them about the chemical inside,” a national fire department official said. “If they had said so earlier, there would not have been so many deaths.”

Background: Bangladesh has endured several mass-casualty fires and industrial disasters in recent years, many connected to its garment factories, which account for 80 percent of the country’s exports.

How to browse, online
By some measures, the book business is doing better than ever. Last year, readers bought nearly 827 million print books, an increase of roughly 10 percent over 2020, and a record since NPD BookScan began tracking two decades ago.
But publishing has an intractable problem: As book buyers have migrated online, it has gotten harder to sell books by new or lesser known authors.
Several apps have tried to reproduce the serendipity of walking into a bookstore and thumbing through the shelves. A new app, Tertulia, which debuted this week, is trying a different approach.
Instead of relying on surveys or trying to hype up older titles, Tertulia uses a mix of artificial intelligence and human curation to distill online chatter about books and point readers to the ones that are driving discussions. It’s an effort to replicate the word-of-mouth recommendations that once drove sales in brick-and-mortar stores.

“If Tertulia can bring up the average discourse about books,” said the essayist and novelist Sloane Crosley, who test drove the app, “long may they reign.”

2022-06-08,"For decades, multibillion-dollar projects across the United States sought to create new downtown neighborhoods, often by reimagining underused assets, like defunct factories or rail yards. In recent years, a new crop of projects has offered the same expansive scope, but with leadership that mirrors the community.
A new generation of Black developers believes that their perspectives will lead to a reshaping of large sections of American cities by focusing on how their deals will benefit underserved communities.
“These agreements represented a radical shift in power relations, taking power from elected officials and developers and giving communities of color the ability to shape projects, enforce promises and oversee the benefits they wanted,” said Ben Beach, legal director for PowerSwitch Action, which works with communities to negotiate these deals.
Having a diverse leadership team can help expand investment in the community, said Gregory Reaves, a co-founder of Black-owned Mosaic Development Partners, whose redevelopment of 109 acres of the Navy Yard in Philadelphia includes a $1 billion pledge for diversity and inclusion, focused on opportunities for businesses owned by women, members of minority groups, veterans and people with disabilities.

Other megaprojects include the $3.8 billion Bronzeville Lakefront project in Chicago and the proposed Affirmation Tower in Manhattan by the developer Don Peebles and the architect David Adjaye. A number of other large-scale projects across the country are undergoing negotiations that would benefit minority neighborhoods, including a $12 billion waterfront stadium development in Oakland, Calif., and the 43-acre Carousel Mall site in downtown San Bernardino, Calif.
But these community-focused deals tend to be informal agreements, rather than well-regulated efforts, critics say. Many community groups, researchers and even developers say they lack teeth and toss small concessions to neighborhoods instead of truly sharing the wealth. Projects can stretch over a decade, making it difficult to maintain oversight by community leaders and transparency for the length of the project, important to ensuring initial promises are kept.
The agreement signed for the Staples Center redevelopment in downtown Los Angeles in 2001 is considered one of the first such compacts, as well as a model of success that has been emulated over time, said Tonya Myers Phillips, community partnerships director at the Sugar Law Center in Detroit, which compiled an online database of 300-plus such agreements.
Instead of simply offering land to developers, with hopes that estimated new jobs and tax revenue would mean growth instead of displacement, the Staples deal included hiring and wage guarantees and promises of specific community benefits. It also provided community control of which commercial tenants could operate within the new development.
But the enforcement methods can differ radically, and critics argue that many agreements are vague, lack democratic decision-making and feature terms that are not measurable or enforceable.

Mr. Beach points to shortcomings in two deals as examples of the problems. During the development of Yankee Stadium in New York, local officials, not community groups, led the negotiations, and the investment fund required by the agreement was run by a Yankees-controlled charity that often sent money to other parts of the Bronx. And in Florida, the Miami WorldCenter initially had vague terminology around local hiring and wage promises, and developers failed to consult community groups or fund job training programs, according to an academic analysis.
There’s just one true measure of success, Ms. Phillips said: “Did it really make a difference in people’s lives?”

Akilah Townsend for The New York Times
For Kimshasa Baldwin, an architect in Chicago, the news that the city was planning to sell the defunct Michael Reese Hospital campus, a 48-acre lakefront site, presented a once-in-a-generation opportunity.
The former campus was a longtime fixture in the Bronzeville community, a Black enclave rich in cultural history that experienced decades of disinvestment. After it closed in 2009, the site had been unsuccessfully put forth as a potential Olympic Village or second Amazon headquarters.

It offered Ms. Baldwin a compelling opportunity to reshape her neighborhood.
In 2017, she became part of the Michael Reese Advisory Council, a 29-member group of neighborhood experts, including lawyers, pastors and historians, assembled by the local alderman, Sophia King. The group provided community input for the $3.8 billion project, which the city awarded to Global Research Innovation Technology, a coalition of firms where Black developers hold half the leadership roles.
“Development is generally done in a manner where the developers take resources from the community,” said Ms. King, who has seen how other megaprojects in Chicago, including Lincoln Yards and the Obama Presidential Library, have prompted criticism from community members. She wanted this project to be different and pushed for the advisory council to give the community a seat at the table.
“The community is generally perceived as being not only kind of robbed of its resources, but almost in a worse position,” she said.
The advisory council exemplifies how development deals are evolving toward promises of more local power and shared economic benefits. The shift comes as the real estate industry slowly evolves from one dominated by white men: People of color held roughly 13 percent of leadership roles in commercial real estate in 2021, an improvement of 1.4 percent from the previous year, according to an analysis from Bisnow, an industry media and events platform.

Community groups say they have learned lessons from past projects.
Victor B. MacFarlane, the chairman and chief executive of MacFarlane Partners, one of the largest Black-owned development firms in the country, points to hiring guarantees often written into these deals. In the past, developments might have mandated 10 percent minority hiring; recent projects promise a 30 percent rate, meaning that hundreds of millions of dollars more go toward firms owned by women and entrepreneurs of color.

In Chicago, the redevelopment of the Michael Reese Hospital campus, now called Bronzeville Lakefront, has committed to a diverse work force at every stage of the project, said Tracey Bey, a member of the advisory council. The developers signed a binding agreement, promising to devote $10 million to a museum and welcome center; spend $25 million to upgrade local educational facilities; ensure 20 percent of on-site housing will be affordable; and hit guarantees on apprenticeships, retail support, diversity hiring and job creation.
Ms. Baldwin brought 25 years of industry experience to bear on discussions about community benefits and design standards. “We know how this goes — you can get things in writing from developers, but once you’re building, things start to shift and pivot,” she said.
She believes GRIT partners have been responsive, especially to demands to build significant affordable housing on the site instead of merely nearby. Quarterly council meetings will be held to check on progress, with members focused on holding developers accountable.
“The model of engagement had never been done,” said Morgan Malone, project executive and co-lead for Bronzeville Lakefront. “Normally, it’s a few town halls led by your alderman. We were meeting every week for eight months negotiating this.”

In Philadelphia, the Mosaic team sees its role as incubators for the Navy Yard project, which will include a mix of housing, retail and even life science labs to tap into the city’s biotech industry. Strict hiring goals, from the architecture firms to material suppliers, are meant to support minority businesses.
A minimum of 35 percent of the work was set aside for diverse firms, allowing minority-led companies to team up on larger projects than they have in the past, said Curt Moody, founder of Moody Nolan, the nation’s largest Black-owned architectural firm, which is designing a significant residential part of the project.
For both the Chicago and Philadelphia projects, developers have pushed to add more local investment. Mosaic has created a crowdfunding program so local entrepreneurs can invest in the Navy Yard project, which has already raised $2.7 million, and GRIT in Chicago seeks to invest in and support local businesses.
The stakes of these kinds of negotiations have become even more important, Mr. Beach said, adding that local governments are becoming more involved.
“Land is political, economic and spatial power — the power to shape your neighborhood,” he said. “Having people of color involved in every aspect of the project is very important, but we want people of color to benefit at every level of the project.”"
2022-06-09,"President Biden met for the first time on Thursday with President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, the leader of the second-largest country in the Western Hemisphere, in a face-to-face discussion that was one of the most anticipated of the ninth Summit of the Americas.
The two leaders were gracious to each other in a photo op before the closed-door session.
“Brazil is a wonderful place with magnificent people,” Mr. Biden said, noting that he had been lucky to visit the “magnificent country” three times in the past. He praised Brazil for making real sacrifices in an effort to protect the Amazon rainforest.
“I think the rest of the world should be able to help you preserve as much as you can,” Mr. Biden told Mr. Bolsonaro.
The meeting had the potential to be one of the most tense of the week.
Mr. Bolsonaro is a close ally of former President Donald J. Trump and a supporter of many of the policies that Mr. Biden has tried to combat. He has opened the Amazon to more logging and mining, made it easier to buy guns in Brazil, denigrated the idea of transgender rights and moved Brazil closer to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
But what is most concerning to U.S. officials is Mr. Bolsonaro’s efforts to question the reliability of Brazil’s voting systems ahead of October’s presidential election, a contest in which polls show him trailing. Mr. Bolsonaro has even questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Biden’s electoral victory, mimicking Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, including as recently as this week.
“I will not discuss the sovereignty of another country. But Trump was doing really well,” he said in a local media interview on Tuesday when asked about allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. elections, which have been repeatedly debunked. “We don’t want that to happen in Brazil.”
Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters ahead of the meeting between the two leaders that no topic was off limits. “I do anticipate that the president will discuss open, free, fair and transparent democratic elections,” he said.
Sitting next to Mr. Biden on Thursday and speaking in Portuguese, Mr. Bolsonaro addressed the concerns about his country’s democratic traditions.
“I came to office through democracy, and I’m quite certain when I leave office it will also be through democratic means,” he said, according to an unofficial translation of his comments.
Several members of Congress had publicly urged Mr. Biden to press Mr. Bolsonaro to increase efforts to find Dom Phillips, a British journalist, and Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian Indigenous expert, who went missing in the Amazon on Sunday after facing threats from illegal fishermen. The Brazilian government’s response has been widely criticized as slow and ineffective.
On Thursday, editors of many of the world’s largest news organizations, including The New York Times, sent a letter to Mr. Bolsonaro, asking him to “urgently step up and fully resource the effort to locate Dom and Bruno.”"
2022-06-10,"THE TWILIGHT WORLD, by Werner Herzog, translated by Michael Hofmann
Twenty-five years ago in Tokyo, where he had come to direct the world premiere of the opera “Chushingura,” the German filmmaker Werner Herzog received an enviable invitation. At a dinner of the cast and crew, the opera’s composer greeted Herzog with the thrilling news that the emperor of Japan would welcome a private audience with him. “My goodness, I have no idea what I would talk about with the emperor,” Herzog responded. The room froze. “I wish to this day that the earth had swallowed me up,” Herzog recalls dramatically in his first novel, “The Twilight World” — a book in which, his epigraph explains, “most details are factually correct; some are not.” When a guest broke the silence to ask if there was anyone in Japan he would, in fact, like to meet, Herzog answered: “Onoda.” He elaborated: “Hiroo Onoda.”
Unless you are a World War II buff with a passion for the Pacific theater, you may ask: Who? Hiroo Onoda was the Imperial Japanese Army lieutenant who landed on the Philippine island of Lubang late in the war, as Japanese forces were retreating, and hid in its jungles until 1974, refusing to believe the war had ended. Camouflaging his clothing and weapons with clay, leaves and bark, he emerged sporadically from the trees like “an ambulating piece of the jungle” to attack perceived foes. In December 1944, Onoda’s commanding officer, Maj. Yoshimi Taniguchi, had ordered him to “hold the island until the Imperial Army’s return” and to “defend its territory by guerrilla tactics, at all costs.” Onoda obeyed. “Your base of operations will be the jungle,” the major said. He added: “You will be like a ghost, elusive, a continuing nightmare to the enemy.” Onoda fulfilled that superhuman assignment.
These details and quoted words come from encounters Herzog had with Onoda in Japan after he turned down the emperor’s invitation. Herzog understood the thrall that the jungle holds on a man who has entwined a fanatical mission with that treacherous terrain. Fifty years ago, Herzog entered the Amazonian rainforests of Peru to film masterworks about monomaniacal dreamers. First came “Aguirre: The Wrath of God” (1972), a historical fiction about a 16th-century explorer who led a doomed expedition to find a fabled city of gold. Next came “Fitzcarraldo” (1982), a drama about an opera-mad entrepreneur who hauled a steamship over a mountain to finance the construction of an opera house in the Amazon. In the early 1890s, the real Carlos Fitzcarrald transported a boat that weighed some 30 tons over a mountain in pieces. Herzog (and his cast and crew) magnified that feat beyond reason (and safety), hauling a steamship that weighed 10 times more — intact — over that same mountain to achieve Herzog’s cinematic vision.
In “Burden of Dreams” (1982), a documentary on the making of “Fitzcarraldo,” Herzog mused on the “articulate vileness and baseness and obscenity” of the jungle. “The trees here are in misery, and the birds are in misery. I don’t think they sing, they just screech in pain,” he said, continuing, “We are cursed with what we are doing here.” And yet, he affirmed, he loved the jungle, “against my better judgment.” With Onoda, he was able to share what Joseph Conrad called “the peculiar blackness of that experience.” In “The Twilight World,” Herzog explains, “I had worked under difficult conditions in the jungle myself and could ask him questions that no one else asked him.” This long-steeped book distills their conversations into a potent, vaporous fever dream; a meditation on truth, lie, illusion and time that floats like an aromatic haze through Herzog’s vivid reconstruction of Onoda’s war.
In the jungles of Lubang, first with other Imperial Army holdouts, later on his own, Onoda subsisted on stolen rice, scavenged fruit and, on occasion, water buffalo meat (smoked under cover of fog). When a leaflet landed on the forest floor in the fall of 1945, announcing the war’s end, Onoda took it as forgery, “the work of American agents.” When one of his band, Yuichi Akatsu, surrendered to the Philippine Army in 1950, loudspeakers appeared on a mountaintop, playing a recording of Akatsu assuring Onoda that he was being treated well. Onoda decided that the voice was a simulation or that, if genuine, Akatsu had been tortured to produce it.
As days melted into months, decades, Herzog writes, time slowed, congealed, evaporated: “A night bird shrieks and a year passes. A fat drop of water on the waxy leaf of a banana plant glistens briefly in the sun and another year is gone.” Michael Hofmann’s resonant translation conveys the portentous shimmer of Herzog’s voice. Sometimes, Herzog writes, Onoda had doubts; not of his duty but of the reality of his experience. “Is it possible that I am dreaming this war?” he asked himself. “Could it be that I’m wounded in some hospital and will finally come out of a coma years later, and someone will tell me it was all a dream? Is the jungle, the rain — everything here — a dream?”

2022-06-11,"Monday began, for me, with a call that became a horror story. I discovered that Dom Phillips, a British journalist and friend, disappeared a day earlier in the Javari Valley, one of the Amazon’s most dangerous regions.
I knew Dom was working on a book about the rainforest where I also live. I asked an Indigenous leader from the Javari Valley to send me a photo so I could be certain the British journalist who had disappeared was him.
When the picture appeared on my cellphone, the certainty punched me in the stomach. It was our beloved Dom, the forest embracing him in green, his sunny face declaring there’s nothing he’s afraid to show the world.
Then our pain deepened. His wife, Alessandra, and his family in England had to be told of his disappearance, as well as The Guardian, for which he was a frequent contributor. (My husband is The Guardian’s global environment editor, and Dom is one of his best friends.)

Also missing was Bruno Pereira, Dom’s traveling companion on the Itaquaí River. Bruno is a leading Brazilian Indigenous expert who had been helping Indigenous communities defend their land. In fact, Bruno was removed from his position at the federal Indigenous agency Funai in 2019, shortly after helping to make an illegal mine inoperable. He had reportedly received death threats before his disappearance over his operations against illegal fishing.

The two men were believed to be passing through an area of the Javari Valley notorious for violence and illicit logging.
As I write, Dom and Bruno are still missing. I don’t know what happened to them. They may have been killed or kidnapped. We fear they may never be found. But we know a few things. Though a search is now underway, the government was initially slow to act, making rescue efforts more difficult.
The disappearance of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira, and the Brazilian government’s inadequate response, are part and parcel of President Jair Bolsonaro’s unwillingness to confront the catastrophic environmental damage underway in the Amazon. And that is extremely concerning.
And since Mr. Bolsonaro came to power, he has relied on nationalist talk to excuse the exploitation of the rainforest. He has scaled back environmental protections, weakened the territorial claims of the Indigenous and undermined environmental groups. By doing this, he has essentially given a green light to land grabbers, who have torched homes and opened fire on Indigenous people in order to stake illegal claims. Support for this destruction is also underway in the National Congress, where the president has pushed for laws to allow mining in Indigenous territory. It is not in Mr. Bolsonaro’s interest or his character to do anything for defenders of the rainforest.

Those who challenge Mr. Bolsonaro’s assertions are treated as if they are threatening sovereign territory. In 2019, when Dom asked Mr. Bolsonaro about deforestation and other environmental concerns at a news conference, he replied: “The Amazon is ours, not yours.”
I have reported on the rainforest for 25 years and have watched the rising insecurity and violence with concern.
With Dom and Bruno’s disappearance, though, the violence appears to have crossed a line. Journalists have been murdered in Amazonian cities, but they have not been murdered in the deep forest for decades. While members of Indigenous communities, leaders of other forest peoples, environmentalists and activists have been killed, criminals have generally not targeted journalists, especially foreign ones, for pragmatic reasons: It’s bad for business. It attracts more press, brings attention from authorities, and invites international scrutiny.
Only Indigenous people and a handful of troops carried out search operations initially. There were no helicopters in the air during the first, crucial days. When the alarm was sounded on Dom and Bruno’s disappearance, the Army said on Monday that it was “ready to conduct a humanitarian search-and-rescue mission; however, action will only be taken under orders from the upper echelon.” Those orders came woefully late. Mr. Bolsonaro seemed to be dismissive of Dom and Bruno’s plight — an “unrecommended adventure,” he said.
We are still hoping for a miracle, still hoping Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira are alive; still hoping that, if they are not, their bodies can be found.

The large-scale destruction of the Amazon began during Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964-85), and it did not stop with the return of democracy. Under Mr. Bolsonaro, though, the Amazon is racing toward catastrophe. Scientists say the Amazon may be close to a tipping point, which will be reached when deforestation hits 20 to 25 percent. It is now approaching 20 percent. If the rainforest becomes incapable of fulfilling its role as a great climate regulator, the global effects will be ruinous.
Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira’s disappearance in the Amazon highlights the dangers facing those exposing the crisis facing Brazil’s rainforest. The global community must respond swiftly and strongly.
The 21st century’s more protracted, harder-to-win wars are the ones unfolding this very minute all across our natural life support systems — the tropical forests and the oceans, which are this world’s true centers. Unless we understand this, we may find it impossible to respond as urgently as needed to halt our race toward self-destruction. We need to fight for Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira; when we do, we fight for all humankind.

What’s Up? (June 5-11)
More Scrutiny of Tesla
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced on Thursday that it was ramping up an investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system, which uses cameras and other sensors to control vehicles with little input from drivers. The agency had been conducting a preliminary evaluation of the system but upgraded to an engineering analysis, looking into whether Autopilot fails to keep drivers’ attention on the road. The new analysis brings more intense scrutiny, covering 830,000 vehicles sold between 2014 and 2021 in the United States and involving all four Tesla models; it’s also a necessary step before a recall can be ordered. Tesla tells drivers to stay alert while using the system, but many experts worry that Autopilot and similar technology can lead drivers to mistakenly believe their vehicles are completely self-driving.
Inflation Soars Again
Fresh inflation data dashed any hopes that price increases had begun to moderate. The Consumer Price Index rose 1 percent from April to May, much faster than the rise from March to April, and monthly core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, was 0.6 percent. Prices climbed 8.6 percent over the year through May, also an uncomfortably fast pace. The numbers make talk of “peak inflation” appear moot: It is increasingly clear the high prices may be enduring, economists say, a reality that has become exceedingly difficult for many Americans, particularly those in low-income households. An index that measures the price of food consumed at home rose 11.9 percent from a year earlier, the largest increase in over 40 years.
An Inquiry Into Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo is facing a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in New York over whether its job interview practices violated federal laws. The New York Times reported in May that, according to current and former employees, the bank had been conducting fake interviews with minority and female candidates to appear to be diversifying its work force. In mid-2020, Wells Fargo adopted a “diverse slate” policy that requires at least half the candidates who interview for six-figure jobs to be members of a disadvantaged group. But some employees said the sham interviews had been going on long before then because of a similar unwritten policy, with candidates interviewing for jobs that had already been promised to others. A bank executive said she did not think the fake interviews were “a systematic issue.”

The Fed Is Likely to Raises Rates

2022-06-13,"An experimental therapy for A.L.S., the paralyzing and fatal neurological disorder, has been approved in Canada, adding a new treatment option for a disease for which there are few effective therapies.
The approval, the first in the world for the treatment — AMX0035, to be marketed in Canada as Albrioza — comes with the condition that the drug company later provide better evidence that the treatment works. It is likely to be of major interest to patients with A.L.S. (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) in the United States, where the same therapy is being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration, which has raised questions about the treatment’s effectiveness.
An F.D.A. review earlier this year found the treatment to be safe, but said there was not enough evidence that it was effective either in helping patients live longer or slowing the rate at which they lose functions like muscle control, speaking or breathing without assistance. A committee of independent advisers to the F.D.A. voted by a narrow margin in March that the therapy was not ready for approval.
The F.D.A. had been scheduled to issue a final decision this month, but recently extended the deadline to Sept. 29, saying it needed more time to review additional analyses of data submitted by the company.

In the meantime, Calaneet Balas, president and chief executive of the A.L.S. Association, one of several patient advocacy organizations pressing for F.D.A. approval, said, “We expect that Americans living with A.L.S. will try to access Albrioza in Canada, just as we have heard reports of people trying to buy the ingredients on Amazon.”
A.L.S., also called Lou Gehrig’s disease, is diagnosed in more than 6,000 people worldwide each year and often causes death within two to five years. There are only two approved A.L.S. medications in the United States: riluzole, which can extend survival by several months, and edaravone, which can slow progression by about 33 percent.
Albrioza is a combination of two existing drugs in the form of a bitter-tasting powder that is mixed with water and drunk or ingested through a feeding tube twice daily. It is produced by a small Massachusetts company, Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, whose founders, Justin Klee and Joshua Cohen, conceived of the therapy when they were undergraduate students at Brown University less than a decade ago.
Their idea was that combining taurursodiol, a supplement sometimes used to regulate liver enzymes, and sodium phenylbutyrate, a medication for a pediatric urea disorder, could safeguard neurons by preventing dysfunction of two structures in cells: mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.

The data comparing Albrioza to a placebo has so far come from one Phase 2 trial (which is smaller than the Phase 3 studies regulatory agencies generally require); additional information came from an open-label extension study that followed some patients after the trial ended, when they were knowingly taking the medication. The F.D.A. typically requires two persuasive clinical trials of a drug for approval, but in cases of severe disease with few available treatments, it can consider evidence from one clinical trial plus additional supporting data.

Health Canada greenlighted Albrioza under a program called Notice of Compliance with Conditions, which allows for approval of drugs that appear promising for serious diseases, but have incomplete evidence that they work. The central condition the agency set is that Amylyx “verify the clinical benefit of this drug” with data from a Phase 3 clinical trial that is underway and expected to conclude in 2024, according to agency documents sent to the company on Friday. The company must also conduct additional pharmacological studies and provide periodic safety reports.  “Patients should be advised of the nature of the authorization,” the documents said.
In a statement, Health Canada said: “Canadians living with ALS have limited options for its treatment. Following its thorough review of the information provided by the company in its drug submission, Health Canada has concluded that the benefits of Albrioza outweigh the risks when used as intended.”
The F.D.A. has a similar program called accelerated approval that allows conditional approval of drugs with incomplete evidence of effectiveness, but that program also requires that a drug show that it targets part of the underlying biological mechanism of a disease. Experts have said that if Albrioza does not win standard F.D.A. approval, it would be unlikely to meet accelerated approval criteria because too little is known about the underlying biology of A.L.S., and how and whether Albrioza might address it.
Last month, 38 doctors who treat A.L.S. patients sent a letter to the F.D.A. urging approval. The A.L.S. Association said its campaign for approval had in recent weeks generated more than 6,000 emails asking the agency to greenlight the drug.

A member of the F.D.A.’s independent advisory committee, Dr. G. Caleb Alexander, who voted in March that there was insufficient evidence the therapy works, said he continues to think the F.D.A. should wait for the Phase 3 trial’s results and that “it would be a mistake to approve it based on the single trial alone.”
Dr. Alexander, an internist and epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said there was desperate need for effective therapies for A.L.S., but that for Albrioza, “it’s unfortunate, but the magnitude of unmet need is not matched by the quality of evidence to date.”
He added that “approval in Canada could only further increase the pressure that the F.D.A. faces to rule favorably and to approve this product.”
It is generally illegal for Americans to import drugs that haven’t been approved in the U.S. for personal use. But the F.D.A. website lists some exceptions that might apply to Albrioza, including if the drug has no serious safety issues and if it is to treat “a serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the United States.”
Dr. Angela Genge, director of the A.L.S. Global Centre for Excellence at the Montreal Neurological Institute, who has received fees from Amylyx for serving on an advisory board, said American patients would be legally able to receive Albrioza in Canada if it were prescribed by a Canadian physician and obtained from a Canadian pharmacy, though they would not be eligible for insurance coverage under Canada’s public or private system.

In an interview, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Klee declined to disclose the price that Amylyx is considering for Albrioza, saying it was still being negotiated. They said that the therapy would be available in about six weeks for people who were paying privately, but would take longer, possibly months, for people to receive coverage under Canada’s public system. Amylyx has already been providing Albrioza at no cost under compassionate-use arrangements to 250 patients in the United States, they said.
Until last summer, the F.D.A. had recommended that Amylyx not apply for approval until the drug had completed its Phase 3 trial, but in July, officials began suggesting that Amylyx submit an application for approval using existing data. The timing followed vociferous pressure from A.L.S. advocacy groups in the wake of the approval of the new Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm, which was controversial because many experts said there was insufficient data that Aduhelm worked.
In the Phase 2 trial, two-thirds of the 137 participants received Albrioza, and over 24 weeks, they experienced a 25 percent slower decline than the participants receiving placebo — declining 2.32 points less on a 48-point A.L.S. scale that rates 12 physical abilities, including walking, speaking, swallowing, dressing, handwriting and breathing.
The open-label extension study involved 90 of those patients, including 34 from the placebo group, who began taking the medication about seven months after those who had received it from the beginning. Those who received the treatment the longest had a median of about 6.5 months more time before being hospitalized, being put on a ventilator or dying, Amylyx reported. Researchers involved in the study published more data last month that suggested additional benefit.
Amylyx financed the bulk of its research on Albrioza, but the A.L.S. Association contributed $2.2 million, using money raised through the 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge. Amylyx has agreed to use sales of the drug to repay 150 percent of the association’s grant to fund more research.
The clinical trials involved patients who developed symptoms within 18 months before the trial and were affected in at least three body regions, generally signs of fast-progressing disease. Health Canada’s approval did not place restrictions on which A.L.S. patients could take Albrioza, but the Amylyx founders and Dr. Genge said it is possible that such limitations might be established by the Canadian coverage system or by pharmaceutical formularies in some of Canada’s provinces."

U.S. promises $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine
Amid increasingly urgent calls from Ukraine, President Biden yesterday announced an additional $1 billion in weapons and aid for the war-torn country. Overall, the U.S. has now committed about $5.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. Germany, Slovakia, Canada, Poland and the Netherlands have also pledged more artillery. Follow the latest updates.
The promise of additional aid came as the U.S. and its allies sought to present a united front against the Kremlin. The war in Ukraine has radically altered the strategic calculus in Europe. Nearly four months in, some fissures are emerging over the end game of an increasingly intractable conflict as Europe grapples with the economic fallout from the war, including rising inflation and gas prices.
Though the U.S. has said it will not pressure Kyiv into negotiations, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, yesterday said that the conflict would eventually have to end with talks. “At some point, when we will have done our maximum to help Ukraine resist — when, I hope, it will have won and the firing has ceased — we will have to negotiate,” he said.

Fed hikes interest rates
The Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in the largest increase since 1994, signaling that it is prepared to inflict economic pain to get inflation under control. The rate increase could be followed by a similarly sized move next month, officials said.
Increasing interest rates will make buying a home or expanding a business more expensive, restraining spending and slowing the broader economy. Officials expect growth to moderate in the coming months and years. Unemployment is forecast to rise about half a percentage point to 4.1 percent by late 2024 as Fed policy squeezes companies and workers.
Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, acknowledged that it was becoming increasingly difficult for the central bank to slow inflation without causing a recession as outside forces, including the war in Ukraine and factory shutdowns in China, threaten to curb the supply of goods and commodities like oil. “The environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months,” he said.
By the numbers: The latest move set the Fed’s policy rate in a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, and more rate increases are to come. Officials expect interest rates to hit 3.4 percent by the end of 2022.

W.H.O. official warns about risks of monkeypox
Dr. Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.’s top official in Europe, yesterday called for urgent action by the authorities and civic groups to control fast-rising cases of monkeypox that he said posed a real risk to public health. More than 1,500 cases have been identified across 25 European countries, accounting for 85 percent of global cases, he said.
“The magnitude of this outbreak poses a real risk,” Dr. Kluge said. “The longer the virus circulates, the more it will extend its reach, and the stronger the disease’s foothold will get in nonendemic countries.” Monkeypox is a viral infection endemic in West Africa, but it has now spread to 39 countries, including 32 that have no previous experience with it.
Infections mostly result from close physical contact, but the virus can also spread through respiratory droplets in prolonged face-to-face contact. The current outbreak has mainly affected men who have sex with men, raising concerns about transmission over a summer of Pride events, music festivals and other mass gatherings. Dr. Kluge said the disease was not a reason to cancel events, but he highlighted the need for awareness.

Next steps: The W.H.O. will meet next week to determine if the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, a formal declaration that calls for a coordinated response from countries.

The fix is in
An explosion of social media stars are teaching followers to flip their furniture — a trend that is perhaps no surprise after a period in which so many people downloaded TikTok to fend off the boredom of being stuck on the couch.
“Flipping,” in this sense, means finding a well-built but aging piece of furniture, refurbishing it — often by sanding, adding fresh paint or varnish and updating its hardware — and reselling it. But many of the people making videos also aim to help viewers improve the furniture already in their homes.
“So many people can’t afford to spend thousands of dollars on furniture,” Christina Clericuzio, a flipper from Connecticut, told The Times. “So it’s fun to show people that they can have these things for less when they D.I.Y.”

European leaders visit Kyiv
The leaders of France, Italy, Germany and Romania met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Thursday in Kyiv, where they expressed support for making Ukraine a candidate for E.U. membership and said they would continue to back Ukraine’s military efforts, despite suggestions to the contrary.
President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, who had been criticized in recent days over the perception that they were seeking to pressure Zelensky into peace talks with Russia, emphasized that their support was genuine: “We are and we will remain by your side in the long run to defend your sovereignty, your territorial integrity and your freedom,” Macron said. “This is our goal, we have no other and we will achieve it.”
All four leaders expressed support for Ukraine’s E.U. candidacy, Macron said. Scholz added that “Ukraine belongs to the European family.”
The European leaders also visited Irpin, a Kyiv suburb where investigators are looking into reports of Russian atrocities during the war. Russia dismissed their trip as empty symbolism. Dmitri Medvedev, the former Russian president, derisively called the leaders “European connoisseurs of frogs, liverwurst and pasta.”

China rewrites Hong Kong’s history
Schoolchildren around the world have long been taught that Hong Kong was a British colony. But students in Hong Kong will soon be told a different lesson: It wasn’t.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A new narrative pushed by Beijing — which rejects how the British saw their relationship to the city — will be explicitly taught to Hong Kong high school students through at least four new textbooks that will be rolled out in the fall.
The textbook material is still under review by principals, teachers, scholars and employees of Hong Kong’s Education Bureau, but it seems destined for classrooms. Local news websites published draft excerpts this week, and The Times viewed teachers’ proof copies.
Excerpts from the textbooks reinforce China’s Communist Party’s position on Hong Kong. “The British aggression violated the principles of international law so its occupation of Hong Kong region should not have been recognized as lawful,” read the teachers’ edition proof copy of one textbook.
Quotable: The narrative, one pro-democracy activist said, “is a shorthand for saying, ‘Hong Kong was always a part of China, thus Hong Kongers never could claim a right of self-determination.’”
Broader effort: The material is part of a wider campaign by China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, to overhaul Hong Kong’s schools, to “protect young minds” and to raise loyal, patriotic citizens.

A Trumpian candidate emerges in Colombia
Rodolfo Hernández, a 77-year-old businessman and former mayor, has emerged as Colombia’s most disruptive presidential candidate in decades, electrifying voters — and a huge TikTok fan base — with a Trump-like “drain the swamp” message.
He’s one of two remaining candidates in Sunday’s election for president of the nation, the third largest in Latin America, with the winner taking control at a pivotal moment in the country’s history.
Hernández has promoted himself as a paragon of democracy, a successful businessman who makes good on promises and cares for the poor. But a Times reporter traveled to Bucaramanga, a mountain-fringed city where he built his empire and once served as mayor, and found a different picture: an anti-corruption candidate who has been indicted on corruption charges, an austerity proponent whose slash-and-burn policies led to a hunger strike by city employees and a construction magnate who once pledged to build 20,000 homes for the poor that never materialized.

The opponent: Hernández faces Gustavo Petro, a former rebel and longtime senator who is hoping to become Colombia’s first leftist president. Their electoral success — they are roughly tied in the polls — reflects an anti-establishment fervor that swept through Latin America as longstanding poverty and inequality intensified during the pandemic.

A major game’s misstep
Diablo is one of the most successful video game franchises, from one of the biggest developers in the world, Blizzard Entertainment. But the latest entry in the series, “Diablo Immortal,” has received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics who say the game’s payment model is predatory.
“Diablo Immortal” is free to download on computers and mobile devices, but it hosts a shop in which players can use real money to buy items to improve their avatar’s gear. Those improvements are not guaranteed; players are, in essence, paying for a virtual scratch-off ticket. By some estimates, it can take thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars to fully upgrade a character.
Belgium and the Netherlands will not get “Diablo Immortal” as a result of anti-gambling rules that ban these types of games. And on Metacritic, a review aggregator, users have given the PC version of the game a score of 0.2 out of 10 — among the lowest of any Blizzard game. — German Lopez

2022-06-17,"A former Amazon engineer who was accused of stealing customers’ personal information from Capital One in one of the largest breaches in the United States was found guilty of wire fraud and hacking charges on Friday.
A Seattle jury found that Paige Thompson, 36, had violated an anti-hacking law known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which forbids access to a computer without authorization. The jury found her not guilty of identity theft and access device fraud.
Ms. Thompson had worked as a software engineer and ran an online community for other workers in her industry. In 2019, she downloaded personal information belonging to more than 100 million Capital One customers. Her legal team argued that she had used the same tools and methods as ethical hackers who hunt for software vulnerabilities and report them to companies so they can be fixed.
But the Justice Department said that Ms. Thompson had never planned to alert Capital One to the problems that gave her access to customers’ data, and that she had bragged to her online friends about the vulnerabilities she uncovered and the information she downloaded. Ms. Thompson also used her access to Capital One’s servers to mine cryptocurrency, the Justice Department said.

“She wanted data, she wanted money, and she wanted to brag,” Andrew Friedman, an assistant U.S. attorney, said in closing arguments.
Ms. Thompson’s case attracted attention from the tech industry because of the charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Critics of the law have argued that it is too broad and allows for the prosecution of so-called white hat hackers. Last month, the Justice Department told prosecutors that they should no longer use the law to pursue hackers who engaged in “good-faith security research.”
The jury deliberated for 10 hours before finding Ms. Thompson guilty of five counts of gaining unauthorized access to a protected computer and damaging a protected computer, in addition to the wire fraud charges. She is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 15.
A lawyer for Ms. Thompson declined to comment on the verdict.
Capital One discovered the breach in July 2019 after a woman who had spoken with Ms. Thompson about the data reported the problem to Capital One. Capital One passed the information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Ms. Thompson was arrested soon after.
Regulators said Capital One lacked the security measures it needed to protect customers’ information. In 2020, the bank agreed to pay $80 million to settle those claims. In December, it also agreed to pay $190 million to people whose data had been exposed in the breach.

“Ms. Thompson used her hacking skills to steal the personal information of more than 100 million people, and hijacked computer servers to mine cryptocurrency,” said Nicholas W. Brown, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington, in a statement. “Far from being an ethical hacker trying to help companies with their computer security, she exploited mistakes to steal valuable data and sought to enrich herself.”"
2022-06-18,"EAST CHATHAM, N.Y. — It’s always a relief when the swallows return. One day, they’re suddenly here, flickering around the house eaves, and whatever was waiting on them to begin — like spring — can now begin.
Same with the bobolinks, which return a little later. One day in early May the bumblebee-colored males are again fluttering over the fields, spilling their tangled song everywhere. It’s all so definite. No waiting for seeds to sprout or buds to burst, no wondering when the beech leaves will fill out. Suddenly there are birds, birdsong and bird flight where there was stillness.
It’s a relief, as I say, but it shouldn’t be a relief. And yet it is. For the last few springs, I’ve felt a secret dread that this might be the year the swallows and the bobolinks don’t return — that something might have gone wrong in their migration.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The barn swallows overwinter in Central and South America. And the bobolinks? They make a 12,500-mile round trip, over the Amazon and as far south as Paraguay. When they return — and I feel relieved — I realize that my conception of spring now depends on their entire migratory landscape, on how humans are altering bobolink-land, all the way from my field where they nest, at the northern end of their range, to the southernmost point of their route and back again.

Bobolinks have always been migrating long distances, and now that I live beside a field where they breed, I’m suddenly aware of it. What I’m also aware of now is the scale of change in the world these birds fly through — the shift in climate severity, in seasonal patterns, in land-use, in habitat destruction, in everything that can affect their survival. Their presence has extended my awareness into a world from which the birds return each spring, as if from peril.
Inevitably this makes me think of Gilbert White, the 18th-century Anglican clergyman who lived in the south of England and whose 1789 book, “The Natural History of Selborne,” has been called the first work of ecology. White was fascinated by the swallows in his village of Selborne, but he had no idea what became of them in winter. There were many theories, including hibernation, but no sure knowledge. “After all our pains and inquiries,” White wrote, “we are not yet quite certain to what regions they do migrate; and are still farther embarrassed to find that some do not actually migrate at all.”
And so I can’t help wondering what spring must have felt like to White when the swallows returned from wherever — from a place he didn’t really know how to imagine. Was it different from my sense of spring? After all, I’ve never seen “my” bobolinks on their winter grounds.
But yes, I think it was different. White suspected that the swallows might freeze wherever they were hibernating, “like insects and bats, in a torpid state.” Yet to his mind there was something almost magically local about swallows — the way “the return of the sun and fine weather awakens them” as though they were somehow inherent in his garden. It may have felt to White as though spring, in the form of swallows, came welling up from within his local purview — rather than returning from a risky journey into a shape-shifting world.

Like everyone else, I wonder about the fate of the seasons in an era of climate change. I’m not a record-keeper like Gilbert White, so I can’t say, from personal information, how much spring has shifted. I know it has. I feel it, though I have a terrible memory for the way the seasons arranged themselves in previous years.
If the boundaries of spring have blurred for me now, it’s because the boundaries of where I live — and where I imagine I live — have also blurred. Some part of me takes flight with the swallows and bobolinks in late summer, out into a world where everything is beginning to be different faster in ways that no one can predict.
White found it implausible that a swallow fledgling, just a few weeks old, could migrate, as swallows do, from Selborne as far south as the Equator. I don’t know what tells the swallows and bobolinks here when it’s time to go — no one really does. But their sudden departure is an annual clue to their sensitivity — to how closely and intently they’re cued into the rhythms of their habitat, a habitat I share with them for a couple of months every year.
I try to remember this: I can imagine their migratory pattern, but they have to fly it, whatever is out there, whatever has changed, wherever they’re going. My sense of spring — my relief that it’s returned — depends more than I ever imagined on changes whose effect I won’t know until next spring, when the swallows and bobolinks return — or don’t.

Russia gains more ground in Donbas
Russian forces mounted an assault on Sunday against Toshkivka, a key Ukrainian defensive position near Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, highlighting Ukraine’s faltering defense of two of the last cities in the Luhansk province of the Donbas region that are not yet under Russian control.
As Russian troops have moved to surround both cities, Ukrainian forces now hold only a small portion of Sievierodonetsk. Russia’s Defense Ministry did not immediately comment on Toshkivka, but said that its forces had seized Metolkine, a town just east of Sievierodonetsk.
The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington research group, said that Russia would likely be able to seize Sievierodonetsk in the next few weeks, but at a considerable cost. The slow-moving fight is sapping the morale of both sides, Western officials said, and NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned that the war could grind on for years.
A brutal war: An analysis of more than 1,000 photos found that Russia has used hundreds of weapons in Ukraine that are widely banned by international treaties and that kill, maim and destroy indiscriminately.

Macron fails to secure a majority
The centrist coalition led by President Emmanuel Macron of France is projected to come out ahead in crucial parliamentary elections, but a strong showing from an alliance of left-wing parties and a far-right surge prevented his forces from securing an absolute majority of seats, a setback that could complicate his second term.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Projections based on preliminary vote counts show Macron’s coalition winning 205 to 250 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, the lower and more powerful house of Parliament. That’s more than any other political group, but fewer than half of all seats. The lack of a majority will force Macron to reach across the aisle, and may hinder his ambitious agenda.
If the projections hold, it will be the first time in 20 years that a newly elected president will have failed to muster an absolute majority in the National Assembly.
Turnout: The vote was marred by record-low turnout, a growing concern in France and a warning sign for Macron, who has promised to rule closer to the people during his second term. Only about 46 percent of the French electorate went to the ballot box, according to projections, the second-lowest level since 1958.

A shocking, perhaps prescient, movie
Living in the world’s oldest society, the Japanese film director Chie Hayakawa had a question for her mother’s older friends: If the government sponsored a euthanasia program for people 75 and over, would they consent to it?
Such a world — dystopian to many — is the setting for Hayakawa’s first feature-length film, “Plan 75,” which won a special distinction at the Cannes Film Festival this month. Most of the people she asked found it to be an attractive option that would ensure they wouldn’t burden their children.
Close to one-third of Japan’s population is 65 or older, and there are more centenarians per capita there than in any other nation. The country has been forced to debate about how it will care for its longest-living citizens. For Hayakawa and many others, a world like the one depicted in her movie feels shockingly plausible.
“She’s just telling it like it is,” said Kaori Shoji, who writes about film and the arts. “She’s telling us: ‘This is where we’re headed, actually.’”

2022-06-20,"BOGOTÁ, Colombia — In a packed arena in Bogotá on Sunday, amid a burst of confetti and below a sign that read “Colombia won,” Gustavo Petro celebrated his victory as the first leftist ever elected president of Colombia.
“The government of hope has arrived,” said the former rebel and longtime legislator, to a cascade of cheers.
For decades, Colombia has been one of the most conservative countries in Latin America, where the left has long been associated with a violent insurgency and past leftist presidential candidates have been assassinated on the campaign trail.
Against that backdrop, Mr. Petro’s win was historic, signaling voters’ frustration with a right-wing establishment that many said had failed to address generations of poverty and inequality that have only worsened during the pandemic.

Mr. Petro’s choice for running mate, Francia Márquez, an environmental activist who will be the country’s first Black vice president, made the victory all the more exceptional. Some of the highest voter turnout rates were recorded in some of the poorest and most neglected parts of the country, suggesting that many people identified with her prominent and repeated calls for inclusion, social justice and environmental protection.
As a candidate, Mr. Petro promised to reshape some of the most important sectors of Colombian society in a nation that is among the most unequal in Latin America.
But now that he will occupy the presidential palace, he will soon have to turn those pledges — some of which critics call radical — into action.
“This is a program of very deep transformations,” said Yann Basset, a political science professor at Rosario University in Bogotá. “On all these issues he is going to need significant support from Congress, which promises to be quite difficult.”

Mr. Petro has vowed to vastly expand social programs, providing a significant subsidy to single mothers, guaranteeing work and a wage to unemployed people, bolstering access to higher education, increasing food aid, shifting the country to a publicly controlled health care system and remaking the pension system.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
He will pay for this, in part, he says, by raising taxes on the 4,000 wealthiest families, removing some corporate tax benefits, raising some import tariffs and targeting tax evaders.
A core part of his platform is a plan to shift from what he calls Colombia’s “old extractive economy,” based on oil and coal, to one focused on other industries, in part to fight climate change.
Some of Mr. Petro’s policies could cause tension with the United States, which has poured billions of dollars into Colombia in the last two decades to help its governments halt the production and export of cocaine, to little effect. Mr. Petro has promised to remake the country’s strategy on drugs, shifting away from the eradication of the coca crop, the base product in cocaine, to emphasizing rural development.
Washington has already begun moving in the direction of prioritizing development, but Mr. Petro could clash with U.S. officials on precisely what this looks like.

Mr. Petro has also pledged to fully implement the 2016 peace deal with the country’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and to slow the destruction of the Colombian Amazon, where deforestation has risen to new highs in recent years.
One of Mr. Petro’s biggest challenges will be paying for his ambitious agenda, in particular finding new revenue to compensate for lost oil and coal money while expanding social programs.
Two other leftists, Gabriel Boric in Chile and Pedro Castillo in Peru, have taken office recently with ambitious promises to expand social programs, only to have their popularity plummet amid rising inflation, among other issues.
Colombia collects less in taxes as a proportion of its gross domestic product compared with almost every other country in the region.
The country already has a high deficit, and last year, when the current president, Iván Duque, attempted to pursue a tax plan to help lower it, hundreds of thousands of people took to the street in protest.

“The budget numbers just don’t add up,” James Bosworth, the founder of Hxagon, a political risk consulting firm in Bogotá, wrote in a newsletter on Monday. “The costs on Petro’s proposed social programs are likely to burn through the budget and leave a rapidly widening deficit.”
“By year two or three of his administration,” Mr. Bosworth continued, “he’s going to have to make tough choices due to financial restrictions and that will end up angering some portion of the coalition that elected him.”
Mauricio Cárdenas, a former finance minister, said that the first step Mr. Petro should take is to announce an experienced finance minister who can calm market and investor fears by assuring the public that he will not be engaging in runaway spending or excessive government intervention.
Another major challenge could be working with Congress. Mr. Petro’s coalition, called the Historic Pact, has the largest number of lawmakers in the legislature. But he does not have a majority, which he will need to push through his agenda. He has already reached out to political leaders outside his coalition, but it’s unclear how much support he will gain — and whether forming new alliances will force him to give up some of his proposals.
“I think he is going to have to abandon certain parts of this program,” Mr. Basset said. “In any case, I believe that he does not have a majority to implement everything he has promised.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Petro will also inherit a deeply polarized society, divided by class, race, region and ethnicity and scarred by years of violence and war.
For decades, Colombia’s government fought the FARC, and the war grew into a complex battle among left-wing guerrilla groups, right-wing paramilitaries and the military, all of which have been accused of human rights abuses.
Despite the 2016 peace accord with the FARC, many of the fault lines of the conflict remain, which has been supercharged by social media, allowing rumor and misinformation to fly.
Polls before the election showed growing distrust in almost all major institutions.
“This election in my mind is by far the most polarized that we’ve seen in Colombia in many years,” said Arlene B. Tickner, a political scientist at Rosario University. “So simply calming the waters and speaking to in particular those voters and those sectors of Colombian society that did not choose him, and that have significant fears about a Petro presidency, I think is going to be a key challenge.”
One of Mr. Petro’s most difficult tasks could be addressing violence in the countryside.
Despite the peace deal, armed groups have continued to flourish, mostly in rural areas, feeding off the drug trade, the cattle industry, human trafficking and other activities.

Homicides, massacres and the killings of social leaders are all up in recent years, and internal displacement remains high, with 147,000 people forced to flee their homes last year, according to government data.
Many people affected by this violence voted for Mr. Petro and Ms. Márquez, who was born in Cauca, one of the hardest hit parts of Colombia.
Mr. Petro’s plan to address the violence includes a land reform that would discourage the ownership of large land parcels through taxation and give land titles to poor people whose lack of resources often indentures them to armed groups.
But land reform has stymied president after president, and Mr. Petro admitted in an interview this year that it may be “the hardest” part of his campaign pledges to fulfill.
“Because it’s this topic that has caused Colombia’s wars,” he said.

2022-06-21,"In 2019, many auto experts said Tesla was making a big mistake by deciding to sell cars only online, arguing that whatever bad feelings people had about dealerships they were essential to the car business.
But the strategy, which was adopted by Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, and combines direct sales with a limited number of stores and service centers, appears to be proving the naysayers wrong. The company dominates the fast-growing electric car market even as other manufacturers struggle to sell cars because of a shortage of computer chips.
Tesla’s approach, which has been copied by other young electric carmakers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, could eventually have major ramifications for the auto industry. Most carmakers and auto dealers are earning rich profits right now because the shortage of new cars has pushed up prices for both new and used cars. Still, car companies and dealers may have to eventually adopt some of the changes Tesla has introduced to win over buyers who have grown used to buying cars online.
People who have traded in conventional cars for electric vehicles made by Tesla and newer companies said they were pleased with the experience and would consider buying future cars in the same way.

“Easiest big purchase of my life, crazy easy,” Rachel Ryan, who lives near Los Angeles, said about her 2021 purchase of a Tesla Model Y. “I bought it while my husband was at work,” she added. “When he came home, I told him he wouldn’t be driving my minivan anymore.”
Ms. Ryan said the only service problem she had was a flat tire from a nail. “Tesla came to my house to fix it,” she said. “Any questions I have, I just email, and they are on it within minutes.”
Buying online is a must for people looking to purchase an electric car made by Tesla, Rivian or Lucid, whose customers can buy only online and directly from the manufacturer. But online car shopping appeals to a large proportion of all car buyers, even those buying combustion-engine cars through dealerships, said Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for Cox Automotive.
“Our data shows consumers want to do more of the process online but most don’t want to eliminate the dealer visit altogether,” Ms. Krebs said. “They just wanted the dealer experience to be something else — focused on the product, the features of the product and a test drive.”
She said some dealerships had started digitizing some or all of the buying process in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when showrooms shut down like other retail businesses. In Europe, some carmakers have gone even further. Daimler, Volkswagen and Volvo are selling cars directly to consumers or have announced plans to do so.

U.S. automakers have also signaled that they would like to make big changes. The chief executive of Ford Motor, Jim Farley, said at an investor conference this month that the company’s distribution and advertising costs per car were about $2,000 higher than Tesla’s. Mr. Farley said Ford wanted to sell electric cars only online at nonnegotiable prices without keeping a large inventory of cars at dealerships.
He added that dealerships would remain important but would have to become more “specialized.” He likened what is happening in the auto industry to the retail business, where the rise of Amazon forced established retailers to sell more on the internet and use physical stores in new ways.
“It’s kind of like what happened between Amazon and Target,” Mr. Farley said. “Target could have gone away, but they didn’t. They bolted on an e-commerce platform, and then they use their physical store to add groceries and make returns much easier than Amazon.”

Established automakers are unlikely to do away with dealerships for another reason: State laws often require them to sell cars through franchised dealers and can make it hard or impossible for automakers to deal directly with customers.

Tesla has lobbied state lawmakers to change laws governing auto sales and has gotten lawmakers in many places to allow the company and other automakers that never had dealerships to sell cars directly to customers.

But in some states like Texas, where Tesla is now based and has a factory, the company has struggled to persuade lawmakers to change laws and rules that favor dealerships. For example, Texas offers a $2,500 rebate to people who buy electric vehicles, but buyers of Teslas are not eligible because those cars are not sold by franchised dealerships.
The National Automobile Dealers Association, which represents dealers, has long opposed direct sales of cars and has urged lawmakers to require Tesla to use dealers, arguing that dealerships are vital to the auto industry and local economies. They have also said Tesla’s approach is much less convenient for car buyers and owners.
“Franchised dealers are absolutely essential to widespread E.V. adoption in the U.S.,” Jared Allen, a spokesman for NADA, said in an email. And as more legacy automakers enter the E.V. market, “effectively selling to these mass-market customers requires leveraging — not rejecting — the existing franchised dealership network,” he added.
“We’re the face of the manufacturer in every small town in America,” Bill Fox, a former chairman of the association, told AutoGuide.com in 2015.

It’s not just dealers who have criticized Tesla. Some Tesla owners complain that repairing or fixing problems with their cars can be an ordeal.
The automaker operates about 160 service centers in the United States, which is far fewer than more established companies — Chevrolet, for example, has more than 3,000 dealerships nationwide. Tesla pledges to send a technician to customers’ homes for minor repairs, but bigger problems have to be dealt with by mechanics at the service centers.
James Klafehn of Ithaca, N.Y., hosts a YouTube channel that focuses on electric vehicles and related topics. He bought a Tesla in 2019 and has published videos documenting how hard it has been to get a variety of problems resolved because he lives several hours from a Tesla service center.
In an October 2019 video, he was scathing about the problems with his Model X sport utility vehicle, which included a hole in a panel and an indentation in a door’s weatherstrip. “I am not excited to make this video. I’ve been dreading it hoping for something positive to happen,” he said. “Unfortunately after five weeks of Model X ownership, the Tesla service experience has been very poor.”
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Other owners who live far from Tesla service centers say the distance has not been a problem. That may be because electric cars tend to require less maintenance than combustion-engine vehicles.

Bill McGuire, the editor in chief of Mac’s Motor City Garage, a website for car enthusiasts, said he had driven 99 miles from his Toledo, Ohio, home to Clarkston, Mich., for a test drive at a Tesla store and subsequently picked his car up at a Tesla service center in Columbus, Ohio.
“It was my first online car buying experience — it was a bit of a surprise and mainly a pleasant one,” Mr. McGuire said. “Some people might want a lot more hand-holding.”
The only problem he encountered with his Model 3 was condensation in the taillights. Tesla sent a technician, and the taillights were replaced in his garage.
Other young electric car companies, like Rivian and Lucid, have even fewer showrooms and service centers than Tesla. Rivian has 19 in the United States, and Lucid has just 10, with seven more scheduled to open this year. That has not dissuaded tens of thousands of people from reserving cars made by the two companies.
Like Tesla, both automakers offer to send technicians to customers’ homes for minor repairs and say major repairs will be handled at service centers. To allay buyers’ fears that more substantial mechanic work could be a hassle, Lucid goes so far as to promise free transport to its nearest service center for cars needing major repairs."

Asia buys up Russian oil
A surge in demand from Asia for discounted Russian oil is making up for the significantly lower number of barrels being sold to Europe, dulling the effects of the West’s sanctions.
Most of the additional oil has gone to two countries: China and India. China’s imports of Russian oil rose 28 percent in May from the previous month, while India has gone from taking in almost no Russian oil to buying more than 760,000 barrels a day.
The oil is being sold at a steep discount because of the risks associated with sanctions imposed to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Still, soaring energy prices have led to an uptick in oil revenue for Russia, which took in $1.7 billion more last month than it did in April.
Details: The ruble cemented its unlikely status as the world’s best-performing currency, rising to new multiyear highs this week on earnings from oil and gas exports.

A train strike in Britain
Britain was hobbled on Tuesday by its largest railway strike in three decades — setting off what union and government leaders warned could be a summer of labor unrest.
Last-ditch talks between the transport union and the rail operator collapsed Monday night, and hundreds of trains ground to a halt for the first of three planned days of strikes, throwing travel plans for tens of millions of Britons and visitors into chaos. Most trains will also probably be halted on Thursday and Saturday, with disruptions rippling across the system for the entire week.
The main railway union is demanding a pay raise in line with the increase in cost of living. The strikes are a major test for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who called on the unions to compromise on their demands at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has kept ridership and ticket revenue well below normal levels.

China’s expanding surveillance capabilities
Phone-tracking devices are now everywhere in China — as are more than half of the world’s nearly one billion surveillance cameras, analysts estimate. The police there are creating some of the largest DNA databases in the world. And the authorities are building upon facial recognition technology to collect voice prints from the general public.
Times reporters spent over a year analyzing more than a hundred thousand government bidding documents, revealing that China’s ambition to collect a staggering amount of personal data from everyday citizens is more expansive than previously known.

The analysis found that the police chose locations to maximize the data their facial recognition cameras could collect, such as places where people eat, shop and travel. In one bidding document from Fujian Province, the police estimated that there were 2.5 billion facial images stored at any given time.
The authorities are using phone trackers to link people’s digital lives to their physical movements. In one case, documents revealed that the police bought phone trackers with the hope of detecting a Uyghur-to-Chinese dictionary app, which would identify phones likely belonging to members of the oppressed Uyghur ethnic minority.

You’re still on mute
It has been almost 28 months since offices shut down at the beginning of the pandemic. More than enough time to buy a ring light, hang some art on the walls and figure out the mute button. But as Emma Goldberg, a Times business reporter found, many people have still not adapted.
Plenty of people have kept working from home with a certain level of flippancy, as though any day might herald a sweeping return back to cubicles and commutes.
At the end of 2021, three million professional roles in the U.S. went permanently remote. Many other workers have been in limbo, going back to the office either part time or waiting for a return-to-office plan that won’t be postponed. The confusion and ambivalence people feel can make it hard to invest in making a remote work setup feel permanent.

2022-06-23,"The world premiere of a stage musical adaptation of the groundbreaking Amazon series “Transparent” will highlight the 2022-23 season of Center Theater Group in Los Angeles, the company announced Thursday.
The production, “A Transparent Musical,” features characters from the original series about a sexagenarian parent in a Jewish Los Angeles family who comes out as a transgender woman. The new musical comedy is billed as “a story of self-discovery, acceptance and celebration.” It will have its world premiere in May at the Mark Taper Forum.
The creator of the original series, Joey Soloway, and MJ Kaufman wrote the book, with music and lyrics by Faith Soloway (who wrote for all four seasons of the television series and composed the songs for its finale). The choreography is by James Alsop (“Girls5eva”), and it will be directed by Tina Landau (“SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical”).
“My sibling and I have dreamed of creating a stage musical that brings the experiences of being trans and Jewish into a mainstream, pop culture fantasia,” Joey Soloway said in a release.
The original series, which was inspired by the siblings Joey and Faith Soloway’s parent’s own transition later in life, was one of the first mainstream shows to focus on transgender issues when it premiered in 2014. It won eight Emmy Awards, and The New York Times’s Alessandra Stanley praised it as “an insightful, downbeat comedy told without piety or burlesque.” It was also the first scripted series to showcase a transitioning transgender character.
“A Transparent Musical” will begin performances on May 20, 2023, and open on May 31, with a limited run through June 25, 2023.
Center Theater Group, a 55-year-old nonprofit theater, will present the world premiere of Larissa FastHorse’s comedy “Fake It Until You Make It” (Aug. 2-Sept. 3, 2023), about “shifters” — people who exist in a world of self-determined identity. It will also present Jane Wagner’s one-woman play “The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,” which stars Cecily Strong of “Saturday Night Live” (Sept. 21-Oct. 23); Lynn Nottage’s Tony-nominated truck-stop-set comedy “Clyde’s” (Nov. 15- Dec. 18); and a revival of Anna Deavere Smith’s “Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992” (March 8- April 9, 2023) at the Taper.
The productions are part of a Center Group season that includes work exclusively by writers who identify as female, transgender or nonbinary, a majority of whom are artists of color, which took shape after the company was called out last fall for its 10-play 2021-22 season, which included only one work by a woman."

A blow to gun regulation.

What the gun ruling means for corporate America
Yesterday’s sweeping Supreme Court decision striking down a New York State law that restricted concealed weapons is likely to set off another round of soul searching among law firms, banks and others about whether to work with the gun industry and its allies.
The law firm Kirkland & Ellis, which argued the case on behalf of gun rights advocates, said it would no longer take Second Amendment cases. In response, Paul Clement and Erin Murphy, the two star Kirkland partners who won the case, said they were leaving Kirkland to form a boutique law firm that would continue to represent gun rights advocates, as well as other clients. It’s not clear how much their departure will hurt the firm financially, given their focus on appellate law, and the billions the firm brings in buttressed by deal making and corporate litigation.
“Having just secured a landmark decision vindicating our clients’ constitutional Second Amendment rights in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, we were presented with a stark choice — withdraw from representing them or withdraw from the firm,” Clement and Murphy wrote in a WSJ Opinion article. “There was only one choice: We couldn’t abandon our clients simply because their positions are unpopular in some circles.”
Kirkland’s decision came after several high-profile clients expressed reservations about the firm’s work on gun rights, The Wall Street Journal reported. But banks and others are facing pressure from legislatures in a number of Republican-dominated states to continue to do work for the gun industry. Texas, for instance, passed a law last year that bans government agencies from working with banks and other professional services firms that “discriminate” against the gun industry. That could affect Kirkland, which has recently been expanding aggressively in Texas, and last year was the highest grossing non-Texas-based firm in the state. Besides Kirkland, there appears to be little or no public response to yesterday’s Supreme Court ruling from other corporate leaders.
Further legal sparring is guaranteed, as legislators will try to craft laws that honor the new Supreme Court decision while still finding ways to limit gun permits. “This sets a new test for Second Amendment cases that calls into question most of the key elements of the gun safety agenda over the last decade,” said Adam Winkler, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in gun policy.
The share prices of gunmakers and ammunition manufacturers jumped yesterday. Smith & Wesson was up more than 9 percent. Shares of Sturm Ruger rose 4 percent, as did shares of Ammo Inc. Firearms companies often rally when investors anticipate a spike in sales ahead of calls for stricter laws, as after the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas. Yesterday’s gains reflect the idea that legal victories over limits on guns are good for the industry.

2022-06-25,"When Tesla awarded Elon Musk a multibillion-dollar pay package in 2018, the landmark deal helped to vastly increase the potential compensation of the chief executives at many of America’s biggest public companies.
The package was composed entirely of an enormous stock grant tied to the company’s performance. As Tesla has sold enough electric vehicles to become the most valuable automaker on the planet, Mr. Musk has so far received shares worth nearly $60 billion now — helping to make him the world’s richest person.
Compensation experts say they see the influence of Mr. Musk’s deal everywhere.
“There’s a lot of companies out there that saw that award and its structure,” said Brian Johnson, executive director with ISS Corporate Solutions, which advises businesses on executive pay and other practices. “They think it’s a good way to incentivize performance.”
A new survey conducted by Equilar, a compensation consulting firm, for The New York Times shows that many of last year’s highest-paid executives got packages that, like Mr. Musk’s, could pay out the sort of sums that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. And even as the gap between what executives and workers earn continued to widen during the pandemic, companies opened the floodgates for what they paid their leaders in 2021.

All of the 10 highest-paid executives had compensation over $100 million, a first. Their average compensation was $330 million, the highest ever.
But it’s not just a few executives at the top enjoying the spoils. Underscoring how widespread the pay increases were last year, the median chief executive made $32.1 million in 2021, up 27 percent from $25.3 million in 2020 and far higher than in prepandemic years.
Jeff Green, chief executive of The Trade Desk, a digital advertising company, reported compensation of $835 million last year, making him the top-paid executive in the Equilar survey, which encompasses 200 companies, all of which have revenue over $1 billion. Mr. Green’s pay in 2021 was the third-highest amount that Equilar found in its past five annual surveys, which are based on companies’ pay disclosures; Mr. Musk’s deal in 2018, which Tesla valued at $2.3 billion, is still the biggest in those years.
Zig Serafin, chief executive of Qualtrics, a software company, was second last year with compensation of $541 million. It was the fourth-highest sum of the past five years. Peter Kern, the chief executive of Expedia, the travel company, was third last year with pay worth $296 million.

While those compensation totals are taken from the company’s financial filings, they are often estimates driven by the companies’ attempts to value the stock their chief executives might receive. As a result, the executives may earn less than those totals, especially if the bear market persists and their companies’ stock prices remain depressed, but they could also take home far higher amounts should the stocks recover.
Many of the highest-ranking executives in the survey received pay packages that were far larger than those of the heads of far bigger companies with much larger profits. For example, Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, received his first equity award since 2011 last year and had total compensation of $99 million, putting him just 13th in the survey.
Despite the growth in pay, shareholders, apparently believing that it is being tied to performance, have voted in favor of most packages. Only 3 percent of “say on pay” votes got less than 50 percent support from shareholders in the year through June 3, according to an analysis of 1,444 public companies by Willis Towers Watson, a consulting firm that advises companies on executive pay programs and corporate governance matters.
For several years, public companies have had to compare their chief executive’s compensation with that of a typical employee, the result of a regulation passed by Congress that aimed to help investors assess the level of executive pay. Last year, chief executives earned 339 times more than the median pay of employees at their companies, up from 311 times in 2020, according to Equilar. The median employee wage rose 10 percent last year, to $92,349 from $83,808.
Last year’s executive pay jumped in part because corporate boards, which decide chief executive compensation, wanted to reward top officers for navigating their companies through the pandemic.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In addition, the stock market rallied in 2021, and the value of stock grants, which typically constitute the largest share of chief executive compensation, was also higher. When stock prices are rising, boards tend to say executives are doing a good job — and pay them more.
And in a world mesmerized by Mr. Musk and his successes at Tesla, boards are even more likely to view chief executives as indispensable — and give them huge pay deals.
“There’s a mind-set that the whole thing will fall apart if we don’t have this off-the-charts talented person in that office,” said Sarah Anderson, a program director at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank that often analyzes chief executive pay. “So many people on these corporate boards are benefiting from the system. They’re either executives themselves or they have some other stake in keeping the compensation system the way it is.”

The largest gap between chief executive and workers in the survey was at Amazon, where this spring a union won a battle to organize a warehouse for the first time. Andrew Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos as Amazon’s chief executive last year, had pay that was 6,474 times that of the company’s median employee. His compensation last year, $213 million, was the eighth highest, according to Equilar. Nearly all of it came from a stock grant.

“The way the S.E.C. rules work, we are required to report that grant as total compensation for 2021 when in reality it will be available to be paid out over the next 10 years, starting in 2023,” Chris Oster, an Amazon spokesman, said in a statement, referring to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates companies’ disclosures. “As noted in the proxy, this award is intended to represent most of Andy’s compensation for the coming years.
Only one woman, Sue Nabi, chief executive of Coty, the cosmetics firm, was among the 20 top-paid executives in the survey, coming in fifth with $284 million in compensation.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Measuring Up to Musk
Mr. Musk’s megapackage was criticized when it was announced in 2018. Skeptics said the enormous riches it promised might encourage him to take too many risks to fulfill the plan’s goals. But pay experts say it inspired boards at other companies to concoct similar deals.
The groundbreaking feature of Mr. Musk’s compensation plan was not so much the performance targets — those have been around for years — but the colossal amount of stock that covered pay for several years into the future. (Tesla’s board has not awarded Mr. Musk any subsequent stock grants.) The stock that he has so far gotten for the award is worth just over $60 billion, a treasure chest that helped him finance his bid for Twitter. Mr. Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Though the value Mr. Musk’s package was huge, its terms were demanding.
Just being employed by Tesla wasn’t enough for Mr. Musk to get any of the award. He received no stock just for showing up, a practice that is common in chief executive packages.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
For him to get the stock, Tesla’s value on the stock market — a function of its stock price — had to keep rising and the company had to hit ambitious targets for sales and operating profits.  This ensured there was a belt-and-suspenders approach to performance measurement. Because Tesla’s business and stock have done exceedingly well in recent years, Mr. Musk received nearly all the stock in the deal, according to a recent Tesla regulatory filing, something that seemed highly unlikely at the time it was announced.
The recent plunge in Tesla’s share price means the stock that Mr. Musk has received from the 2018 award is worth significantly less than it was just months ago.
Though they have the potential to pay out huge amounts, in certain respects last year’s biggest pay deals were not as demanding as Mr. Musk’s.
For Mr. Green of The Trade Desk to qualify for the options in his package, valued in the proxy statement at $828 million, the company’s stock price must climb well above current levels, but there are no business goals for The Trade Desk to achieve.
Melinda Zurich, a spokeswoman for The Trade Desk, said the stock price targets in the company’s award were ambitious and noted that its stock was up several thousand percent since its initial public offering in 2016.

“Jeff has played an integral role in driving that growth, and is key to the company’s future growth agenda,” she added.
Mr. Serafin of Qualtrics doesn’t have to hit any performance targets to qualify for roughly two-thirds of his stock pay last year; he just has to remain in his post to get those shares, which the company valued at $360 million in its proxy statement. And his performance-based shares, valued at $180 million, have business operating targets but no stock price goals. Mr. Serafin has already received shares from both awards.
“As a technology company that encounters significant competition for qualified personnel, long-term incentive compensation plays a critical role in our ability to attract, hire, motivate and reward qualified and experienced executive officers,” Qualtrics, which carried out its initial public offering last year, wrote in its proxy statement. Some companies have awarded executives a large amount of stock when going public as a way to give them “skin in the game.”
Among the highest paid, Ms. Nabi of Coty appears to have one of the easiest packages to earn.
Not only does the $280 million in stock awarded to her last year have no share price or business goals attached, she has already received a third of the stock outright — and stands to get the rest of the award as soon as August next year.
A company spokesman noted that Coty’s stock had risen since Ms. Nabi became chief executive in 2020 and added, “Ms. Nabi is one of the beauty industry’s leading founder talents: a hugely respected business leader with an outstanding track record in the sector. In order to attract a true entrepreneur like her, Coty needed to have an enticing equity scheme.”

No Limit
Even though there are many well-used ways to construct rich pay packages, companies are still finding novel ways to do so.
Last year, Ariel Emanuel, the chief executive of Endeavor Group and a powerful Hollywood figure who was the basis for a character in the series “Entourage,” got a performance stock award that places no maximum on the amount of stock it could pay out, according to the company’s proxy statement. If Endeavor stock keeps hitting higher price targets, the award keeps paying out stock, for 10 years. (By contrast, Mr. Musk’s blowout package had a capped number of shares.)
“I haven’t seen a plan like this before, with what appears to be no cap on payouts,” said Steven Hall, a compensation consultant.
Endeavor, which went public last year, valued the uncapped award at $196 million. Mr. Emanuel got another stock award last year, worth $72 million, that he can receive in full if he stays in his post through next May. Equilar calculated Mr. Emanuel’s total pay last year to be $295 million, placing him fourth in the survey.
“Mr. Emanuel’s compensation in Endeavor’s I.P.O. year reflects the value he has created over the last 25 years since founding the company and is tied to its continued performance and the creation of long-term value,” a company spokesman said in a statement.
If Endeavor’s stock, which has recently plunged, does not recover, Mr. Emanuel won’t collect much of his performance stock grant. But Tesla’s stock also fell in the months after Mr. Musk received his giant deal. It then soared, clearing the way for Mr. Musk, and other chief executives after him, to enjoy sky’s-the-limit pay."

2022-06-27,"As people bought up Plan B and other emergency contraceptive pills after the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade on Friday, at least two major pharmacies put limits on purchases or deliveries of the pills, which typically cost $10 to $50.
CVS said it would temporarily cap purchases of emergency contraceptives at three packs “to ensure equitable access and consistent supply on store shelves.”
On its website, Walgreens said the product was available for pickup in stores on Monday, and a spokeswoman said purchases were not being limited at this time. But the pharmacy said it would temporarily stop delivering the contraceptives to customers’ homes.
“Walgreens is still able to meet demand in-store,” the spokeswoman said in an email, adding, “We are working to restock online inventory for ship-to-home.”

Kroger’s website said its Plan B stock in its supermarkets was low. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon’s website had various emergency contraceptives available, but most of them not for delivery before mid-July. The company did not immediately respond to an email asking if the fulfillment times were unusual.
Walmart, which had limited some purchases of the pills, said in a statement: “Many of our products have online purchase limits in place. During times of fluctuating demand, these limits may change.”
Birth control is legal in the United States, but some legal experts have warned that legislators will use abortion bans to limit access to contraceptives.
Morning-after pills can temporarily interfere with ovulation and prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of sexual activity. Some companies that sell emergency contraception said sales jumped significantly after a draft ruling that was leaked last month revealed the Supreme Court was likely to overturn Roe v. Wade, ending federal abortion rights.
Abortion pills, which are different from emergency contraception and were used in more than half of recent abortions in the United States, have also become more sought-after since Friday."

By Lidia Yuknavitch
338 pages. Riverhead Books. $28.
As in “Alice in Wonderland” or an old-fashioned Disney cartoon, things perk up considerably in Lidia Yuknavitch’s willfully difficult new novel, “Thrust,” when the animals talk.
Their conversation, with a young girl who moves Alice-like through a series of weird mirror worlds, is surprising, hilarious and a proper comeuppance to us arrogant humans and our systems. “The whole concept of evil … what the hell is that all about?” asks a box turtle named Bertrand. (In the movie version, he’d be played by Wallace Shawn.) “This god business is absurd,” he says later. “It’s got you all mucked up out there.”
Earthworms and fungi confer in front of the girl disapprovingly, as if in a dark version of “Fantasia.” “My god, your ignorance about the flora and fauna of the Amazon — staggering,” scoffs a mycelium. (Despite his atheism, Bertrand will also toss off a contemptuous “my god.”) There’s “a tiny chorus of worm laughter,” worse than any mean clique in the middle-school cafeteria. Thank goddess for the helpful, maternal whale who asks: “Do you have a name, dear?”
The girl’s name is Laisve, which means “liberty” in Lithuanian, and she is a central character — though not the central character — of “Thrust,” whose sprawling, fragmented structure calls centrality itself into question (as well as liberté, égalité and, most particularly, fraternité). Another important figure is the Statue of Liberty, constructed by an “ocean of laborers,” one of whom ruefully observes a suffragist spitting in their creation’s face because women don’t yet have the right to vote. Another is the statue’s real-life designer, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, whom Yuknavitch imagines locked in a sadomasochistic affair with a fictional older cousin, Aurora Boréales. In one of their tamer pieces of correspondence, he describes creating a “threesome-facilitating chair” with adjustable holsters for the legs and derrière.

Such liberties will not surprise those familiar with the author’s work, which tends to rip apart and restitch established history in crazy-quilt patterns, and to hell with any hanging threads. In “The Book of Joan” (2017), Yuknavitch planted Joan of Arc in a dystopian future. In “Dora: A Headcase” (2012), she moved one of Freud’s best-known study subjects to Seattle and outfitted her with a Dora the Explorer backpack. Yuknavitch’s own memoir, “The Chronology of Water” (2011), is decidedly not chronological in the received sense, and confers mystical, perhaps even magical powers on the aqueous. As does “Thrust,” whose sensitive attunement to marine ecosystems had me looking at my bathtub sea sponge with new eyes. (Perhaps it was looking back?)

The book loops around a couple of centuries, from the conception and construction of Lady Liberty in the 1880s to 2085 and beyond, when the statue has, as in “The Day After Tomorrow” and at least one other disaster movie, been submerged by rising seas. At least the rent is no longer too damn high: The area formerly known as Brooklyn is now called The Brook, with medieval-sounding regions named Rinnegackonck and Werpos. (Gowanus, known in the present day for its canal of toxic sludge, has somehow survived.)
Businesses have crumbled, and the economy has gone underground. Terrifying raids might occur at any moment, with “armed men in vans snaking like killer whales through the streets, taking people away to god knows where.” Laisve’s mother has died, her baby brother has been kidnapped and her father, Aster, has epilepsy and, understandably, psychic distress. Objects float through time, space and occasionally comprehension: a penny (the taste of copper always twinned with blood); an umbilical cord; an apple. Laisve is a “carrier,” transferring them from one setting to another.
We meet and sympathize with Mikael, a teenager in a detention center who has foreknowledge of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. But in an acidic twist of the maritime custom “women and children first,” they are the primary drivers of “Thrust.” (In a recent interview, Yuknavitch spoke of trying to strip the word of its phallocentric connotations.) Aurora, who loses her own leg — not to worry, Frédéric supplies a well-researched prosthetic, hand-painting the red toenails — has a room to teach those maimed by underage labor. (She also maintains a “Room of Kneelings” for adult pursuits.)

The story teems with anguish for these “small ghosts,” like a girl with a disfiguring necrosis called “phossy jaw,” from working around phosphorus in a matchstick factory. “The sunk cost of mechanizing America, creating the fiction of freedom,” Aurora declares, “included the slashing of woman and child bodies.” Some of these passages feel preachy, like they’d better belong in The Nation than a novel. Laisve is also the name of a defunct radical political newspaper — so, perhaps, a carrier of ideas.
Contempt for humanity’s cruelty and selfishness flows through “Thrust.” “The thing about mycelia was, they stick together,” Mikael says, narrating his bleak boyhood to a social worker in — what else? — “waves.” “Whereas the thing about people was, they’re mostly individual meat sacks that own and devour everything in their path, and you never know when their insides will come out.”
It’s hard to buck the critical tide here — Yuknavitch elicits rapture in many readers — but also hard to maintain a grip on characters so obviously laden, heavy with meaning greater than themselves. “Thrust” is an indignant and impressive novel, but only in spurts an enjoyable one, and maybe that’s exactly the point. Some will hurl it unfinished across the room. Others will savor its elaborately orchestrated punishments."
2022-06-29,"New foundations spring up all the time, but rarely on the scale of the Ruth Foundation for the Arts, which was established this year and announces its first grants this week.
Funded by a $440 million bequest from Ruth DeYoung Kohler II, the foundation immediately enters the highest echelons of arts philanthropy. Kohler, who died in 2020 after a career of nurturing self-taught artists, was a scion of the Wisconsin bathroom-fixture fortune, as a member of the eponymous founding family of the Kohler company.
The foundation, based in Milwaukee, is planning to give away between $17 to $20 million a year. “They will be right up there at the top,” said Joel Wachs, the president of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. His foundation gives away around $17 million a year, he said.
The Ruth Foundation’s initial round of giving spreads $1.25 million among 78 different nonprofit organizations in the visual and performing arts. It plans to make another round of donations this fall and in spring 2023.

The grantees range from well known to less so, including Maine’s celebrated Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture; the alternative art space White Columns in New York; the arts center Appalshop of Whitesburg, Ky.; and the Griot Museum of Black History in St. Louis.
Two groups from Milwaukee are receiving grants, Milwaukee Film and Arts at Large, which supports equitable access to arts education.
Karen Patterson, the executive director of the Ruth Foundation, said that the scope of philanthropy may evolve.
“I’m not too quick to define it yet,” said Patterson, who is one of only two full-time employees. “We’re building as we go.”
Fueled by nearly half a billion dollars, it has the potential to provide a safety net for many smaller arts organizations.

“I’m bowled over by the impact we can have,” said Patterson, who formerly worked as a curator at the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wis.
That is where Patterson got to know Ruth Kohler, who ran the center from 1972 to 2016. It was established in 1967 and was named for her grandfather, the founder of the Kohler Company.
The center gained a reputation for its focus on folk art and work by self-taught artists, a particular interest of Ruth Kohler’s. In 2021 the center opened the Art Preserve, an experimental space for artist-built environments, which was one of her passion projects.

“Ruth Kohler was early to self-taught, vernacular art,” said Margaret Andera, a contemporary art curator at the Milwaukee Art Museum. “We’re used to that now, but many institutions were late to that game. She was an innovator.”
About half of the foundation’s grantees are ones to which Kohler gave quietly during her lifetime, through the R.D.K. Foundation, a predecessor to the Ruth Foundation; and the other half were nominated by a group of nearly 50 artists.

Her giving was low-key, as were many things about Kohler. For one, she didn’t like to be photographed, said Patterson, who worked closely with Kohler for seven years.
“I didn’t know about it, honestly,” Patterson said of Kohler’s previous giving. “It was under the radar.”
Beyond the parameters of visual art, performing arts and arts education, Kohler’s vision for the Ruth Foundation was not specific about where its money should go, giving Patterson and the three-person board of trustees a lot of leeway.
“Ruth was never prescriptive,” Patterson said. “She used to say, ‘All the art for all the people.’”
Patterson added that Kohler had her own way of working: “She was always idea-focused and always there to make things happen. Ruth followed the lead of artists.” She always wanted to make sure that staff members were pushing themselves creatively.
Michelle Grabner, who, in addition to making her own art, teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and has helped the foundation by nominating grantees, knew Kohler for decades.

“She was a formidable woman,” Grabner said, adding, “She had opinions, she was strong. The Midwestern nice thing, she didn’t have time for that.”

Since none of the organizations receiving money applied for grants, the money came as a surprise to many of them.
The Women’s Studio Workshop in Rosendale, N.Y., will receive $10,000 in the first round of grants.
“I thought it wasn’t real at first,” said Lauren Walling, the workshop’s executive director. “I was thinking, ‘Are they trying to get bank info from me? Is this a scam?’”
Founded in 1974 as a residency program for women artists, the workshop specializes in prints, works on paper and handmade artist books. It has evolved to include queer, transgender and nonbinary artists.
“As a person who is constantly raising money, you’re always pushing a rock up a hill,” Walling said. “When someone says, ‘Here’s some money,’ you want to fall over.”
Walling added that the workshop was recommended for the grant by the artist Andrea Chung, which made it even more meaningful.

“What’s special is that this foundation is going to artists first,” she said. “They’re asking, ‘Who has moved you, who has changed your life?’”
The First Peoples Fund, headquartered in Rapid City, S.D., will receive $20,000. The fund’s president, Lori Pourier, described the organization as devoted to supporting “Native artists and culture bearers and traditional keepers of tribal communities.”

Pourier had never heard of Kohler before she was contacted by the Ruth Foundation.
“That’s what was so exciting about it,” she said. “It means more support for rural, isolated tribal communities, where most of our work takes place.”
The grants also “help us get recognized by the larger philanthropy community,” Pourier added. Before this grant, it had also received support from the Ford Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. In 2021 the fund unexpectedly received $6 million from MacKenzie Scott, the billionaire philanthropist who has been aggressively donating the fortune gained from her stake in Amazon.
Armed with not quite the fame and philanthropic resources of Scott, Patterson is preparing to be deluged with requests. But she did not seem to have trepidation about it.

“I think about that all the time,” Patterson said of the likely influx. “I hope people look at our grantee list. We’re artist-centric and community forward. If you see yourself in that list, by all means, let’s talk.”"
2022-06-30,"When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday, Veronica Risinger started what she thought would be a tiny Facebook group for her neighbors in Kansas City., Mo., to share resources for people seeking abortions.
But Risinger’s phone notifications never stopped. Her little group has morphed into a 30,000-member nationwide nexus for rage, heartfelt personal stories and education among people anxious about a post-Roe America.
Risinger doesn’t understand how her Facebook group grew so large. At one point, she said, there were 10,000 people waiting to join the private group, USA Camping Resource Center. (“Camping” is a code word used in some online conversations about abortion.)
She wasn’t ready for the time commitment or for the responsibility of providing people with a place to express their feelings and to find information about the fast-changing legal status of abortion in the U.S. But she feels that she must do the best she can. “I don’t want to be doing this, but this is the world that we’re living in,” Risinger told me.

That one woman became an unwitting leader of a large forum for abortion rights supporters shows that Facebook remains a place where Americans hash out their hopes and fears. As it did for Facebook groups that sprang up to promote the false claim of widespread 2020 election fraud, emotion can help online communities to go viral in ways that surprise their creators and the company itself.
On Friday morning, Risinger was at work, and seething. Within minutes of the Supreme Court decision, her home state of Missouri enacted an immediate “trigger law” banning abortion.
“I was filled with such rage,” she told me this week. “I thought, OK, I can give people a place where they can get together.”
Risinger has experience overseeing other Facebook groups, and she started USA Camping Resource Center largely — or so she thought — for people in her area who shared her anger and who wanted to vent, to talk about what they could do or to offer help. “Maybe that could have worked if it were me and 10 people in my neighborhood,” she said.
Almost immediately, it became far more than that. People have flooded the Facebook group, telling raw personal stories about having an abortion or being denied one. And they ask many questions about how these bans could affect them.

Risinger said that one woman in Missouri messaged the group because she was worried about her legal risk from a planned procedure for implanted birth control. (Birth control remains legal across the U.S. The Kansas City Star has more information about access in Missouri.) Women also asked whether data from period-tracking apps might be used by law enforcement to build a case against them for having an abortion. (Period-tracking apps can be a risk, but other data can be more incriminating.)
For those seeking information, the group directs people as much as possible to authoritative sources, including organizations experienced in abortion advocacy and assistance.
People seem to find out about the group mostly by word of mouth, and the response has amazed Risinger, who now finds herself moderating posts at all hours, including minutes after running a race on Saturday.
But the group became highly active very quickly, and Risinger said she felt overwhelmed. She said she quickly shifted her plans: “We had the group before we really knew what we were doing.”
As is done in many other Facebook groups, Risinger decided that the best approach to keep the conversation from going off the rails was to make rules and to enforce them strictly. The top rule: “Don’t be a jerk,” and there’s no room for debate about abortion rights.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
People who want to join the group must first answer why they support “camping.” (Some people apparently believe it’s a Facebook group about the outdoors.) Each newcomer as well as each post is approved by a moderator, of which there are now about 20 whom Risinger enlisted after the group became too big for one person to handle.
To protect people from the safety risks that could come with offering rides or homes to strangers, the group started to block posts that proposed personal assistance for abortion appointments.
Facebook’s critics have said for years that groups on the site have become hubs for unchecked conspiracy theories or health misinformation. And fringe groups on Facebook and elsewhere online have spread false ideas or calls to violence in response to the Roe ruling. After Facebook flagged some comments in Risinger’s group for breaking the company’s rules against violence and incitement, she told members to stop suggesting violence as a solution to problems. (Everything that I read in the group was respectful and nonviolent.)
I asked Risinger how people’s behavior might be different on Facebook than in an in-person community. Are people more emotionally vulnerable, or more cruel?
“Are people worse on Facebook than they are in real life? Almost always yes,” she said. But on the other hand, the group would never have so rapidly expanded without social media, she said.

Risinger says she doesn’t know what the future holds for the Facebook community that she created in a fit of rage. She hopes to harness people’s energy into productive action. There are discussions about mobilizing  around an August election in Kansas, in which voters will decide whether to remove the right to an abortion from the state constitution.
“The momentum we have is something that is not lost on me,” Risinger said. “I’m going to do whatever I can to make sure it gets put to good use.”

Lessons from a hellish vacation plan
Hoo boy, Brian X. Chen, a consumer tech columnist for The New York Times, has a very 2022 travel horror story. And he offers advice to avoid his bad experience.
Last year I wrote a column about using tech to make travel plans in a pandemic. That advice still applies: Check your destination’s travel and tourism websites for potential requirements about Covid-19 vaccines and test results, and carry a digital copy of your health data on your smartphone.
I have another hard-earned lesson from my own bad experience.
I booked plane tickets this year to fly across the country for a wedding in the fall. I used Hopper, a travel price comparison service, to find and book the cheapest Delta flights.
I regret it. Over the past few months, Delta changed my flight itinerary multiple times and even canceled one of my connecting flights. After I waited on hold for more than an hour to speak to a Delta representative, the company put me on a different flight. Problem solved? No.
When I didn’t receive a confirmation of my new ticket, I reached out again. A Delta representative told me that Hopper had canceled the ticket after Delta changed it. The only way to reach Hopper is through email support, whose response could take up to 48 hours, unless you want to pay more.

After an email to Hopper and another call to Delta, the airline put me on a different flight again. I sent another email to Hopper, asking that the company not touch the reservation. Crisis averted. I hope.
The lesson? If you’re booking travel online, simplify the process. Airlines are short-staffed, and you might face long waits for customer support. Travel booking services like Expedia and Hopper may save you money, but they may not be worth it.
Cut out the middlemen, and book directly with the airlines and hotels. That way, if you run into problems, you are dealing with one company and not two.

Before we go …
Deleting your period tracker won’t protect you. Text messages, email receipts and Google searches contain more data about people who seek abortions than a tracker does, my colleague Kash Hill wrote.
From Wednesday’s On Tech: Our data is a curse, with or without Roe.
Amazon moved to restrict items and search results related to L.G.B.T.Q. people and issues on its website in the United Arab Emirates after the government pressured the company, my colleague Karen Weise reported. It’s the latest example of compromises that tech companies make to operate in restrictive countries.
“Everything happens so much.” That odd but perfect tweet posted 10 years ago is regularly recirculated when people feel overwhelmed by what’s happening around them, The Atlantic explained. There’s also a mysterious back story for what seemed to be a computer-generated Twitter account but wasn’t. (A subscription may be required.)

The running (sort of) of the goats. Each summer, a park in New York City enlists goats to munch on invasive plants. They were released into the park on Wednesday, and not all of them are exactly hoofing it. (See what I did there?!)

2022-07-01,"A little over halfway through 2022, the year in movies has already been intriguing, with one of the best-reviewed releases so far topping the box office. That would be “Top Gun: Maverick.” But if you’ve already seen it and want to catch up on other strong films, I asked The Times’s co-chief critics, A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, for their favorites. Here they are, in no particular order. — Stephanie Goodman
‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’
The story: A laundromat owner (Michelle Yeoh) is stressed out. Her husband is filing for divorce. Her daughter is depressed and angry at her. And to top it off, the I.R.S. is auditing her. When she goes in to fight the audit, her encounter with an unbending bureaucrat sets off a multiverse romp that showcases the lives she could have lived (and the hot-dog fingers she could have had) and, more important, different paths for her relationships.
A.O. Scott’s take: “The antic cleverness serves a sincere and generous heart,” our critic wrote of the film directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, who work under the name the Daniels. “Yes, the movie is a metaphysical multiverse galaxy-brain head trip, but deep down — and also right on the surface — it’s a bittersweet domestic drama, a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filled ballad of mother-daughter love.”
Read the review, and interviews with Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, who plays her husband. You may remember Quan, who started off as a child actor, as Short Round in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.”

2022-07-02,"When Breanna Dietrich was 18 and working at a restaurant in West Virginia, she got pregnant. The father was a man she knew she wouldn’t marry. She considered getting an abortion. But the nearest clinic was four hours away and she couldn’t afford to take off work — so she had the baby girl.
That girl is now 17 and working at a restaurant chain that has not told its employees whether it will cover abortion-related travel expenses, though abortion is now prohibited in West Virginia. This past week, Ms. Dietrich urged her daughter to find an employer that would cover the expense.
“It would be awesome for her to move to a state that offers it, or at least work for a company that says, ‘Hey, we’ll foot the bill,’” Ms. Dietrich said, recalling her own struggle years ago to consider the logistics of an abortion. “How was I, at 18, going to be able to drive four hours away, pay for it, take off work? There would’ve been no way.”
In the week since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending nearly 50 years of federal abortion rights, dozens of large U.S. companies have said they will cover expenses for employees who need to travel out of state for abortions. Some companies even said they would relocate employees from states where abortion is banned.

Some business leaders now talk about access to reproductive health care as a benefit, akin to dental or egg-freezing coverage. Many of the companies quickest to come forward are those known generally for generous policies on paid leave, health care and other perks that proliferate in competitive industries. Abortion-related benefits are more divisive, of course, given that 37 percent of Americans say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases.
As the post-Dobbs v. Jackson landscape comes into focus, many women are discovering that, even more so than a week ago, where they happen to work can determine the shape of their lives outside work, too. Their job could be the difference between being able to get an abortion or not.
Employers have long held sway over workers’ reproductive health care — whether they can take paid leave to have a baby, afford child care or get access to birth control. About half of Americans have health care tied to their employers. But the involvement corporations now have in abortion access illuminates a stark divide.
For high-income women, an employer’s offer to cover abortion-related travel might be viewed partly as a signal of psychological support or a political stance. For women in low-income jobs, a company’s policy will determine whether or not they can afford to cross state lines for an abortion.

About 40 percent of American women cite financial reasons as a factor in their decision to get an abortion, yet many of the companies that employ the country’s low-wage workers have not announced that they will cover out-of-state abortion expenses. Some of the largest companies in retail and hospitality, industries whose work force is predominantly female, haven’t made a statement on the question.

“In low-wage sectors, this is going to become one of those issues where people are leaving low-paying jobs for slightly better-paying jobs,” said Bianca Agustin, director of corporate accountability for United for Respect, a nonprofit labor advocacy group. “Given the spread of companies that have public commitments, I imagine there will be some movement on this.”
Walmart, Darden Restaurants, McDonald’s, Home Depot, Hilton, Dollar General and FedEx, which together employ millions of people across the country, have not said whether they will cover travel for out-of-state abortions. A spokeswoman for Walmart, which has 1.7 million U.S. workers, said the company regularly reviews its benefits based on demand from employees, and the company is now “looking at the evolving federal and state landscape” as it considers its offerings. The rest of the companies listed did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“We are working thoughtfully and diligently to figure out the best path forward, guided by our desire to support our associates, all of our associates,” wrote Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, in a memo to staff on Friday.
Amazon, the country’s second-largest private employer after Walmart, said it would cover out-of-state abortion travel for its employees, most of whom are hourly workers. But that benefit applies to employees on its health care plan, not the contractors who make up a substantial portion of its work force, such as its vast network of delivery drivers.

As the list of companies covering abortion-related travel grows longer, some workers wonder why their employers won’t do the same. Isabela Burrows, 19, who works at a PetSmart in Howell, Mich., learned that Roe v. Wade had been overturned from a customer last week and grew frustrated that her company hadn’t said anything. Michigan has an abortion ban that has been blocked in court and that Democratic leaders have said they will not enforce.
“I wish they would do something,” Ms. Burrows said of her employer. She said her greatest source of relief has come from reading about the companies that have announced new reproductive health care benefits. “They cared enough that they would send you to go get the help and care you need.”
PetSmart has not announced plans to cover abortion-related travel for its employees, and the company did not respond to a request for comment on whether it plans to do so.
A company’s policies on reproductive health care access could affect how desirable it is to job candidates in what remains a tight labor market. A survey of college-educated workers, commissioned by the Tara Health Foundation, found that 70 percent said companies should address abortion access as part of their gender equity efforts. A survey from Morning Consult, also commissioned by the Tara Health Foundation, found that 71 percent of adults said people should consider a state’s social policies when deciding whether to move there.
Vanessa Burbano, a management professor at Columbia Business School, said that for workers who live in states where abortion is no longer legal, the policies their employers set do more than just signal a company’s politics.

“There’s a tangible, real world implication for your own personal health care,” she said, adding that employers are striking a delicate balance. “They’re trying to walk the very fine line of not making these big, broad, public blanket statements about the issue while simultaneously trying to address concerns of their employees.”
Gina Lindsey, 48, a public-school teacher, recalled that when she sent her daughter off to college four years ago, she advised her to make pay, benefits and sense of purpose priorities when looking for a job. Now Ms. Lindsey urges her daughter to take into consideration the employer’s approach toward out-of-state abortion coverage.
“That’s going to become part of the calculus,” said Ms. Lindsey, who lives in Ohio, where abortion is now banned after six weeks of pregnancy.
She worries, though, about the many people her daughter’s age whose employers will not cover their abortion-related travel expenses. “How many people are able to get a job at Google?” she asked. “How many people are able to get a job at Disney? How many people truly have that opportunity, especially in states where the bans are in place?”
Most people don’t plan to need abortion-related travel benefits: “Very rarely do people think that they themselves are going to need an abortion,” said Diana Greene Foster, a demographer at the University of California, San Francisco, and the principal investigator of the Turnaway Study, which looked at the economic consequences of having or being denied an abortion. “I doubt they would switch jobs because they think they themselves will be affected.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
And if they do want to switch, finding a job with expanded reproductive health benefits can be difficult. Rhonda Sharpe, an economist and the president of the Women’s Institute for Science, Equity and Race, said the women in low-wage jobs most likely to need these benefits are least able to conduct a job search — and cover the expenses in child care and time off work that can come with it.
Relying on employers to bridge the gap between workers and reproductive health services will become more difficult, legal experts warn, as anti-abortion groups say they will try to ban out-of-state abortions and penalize the companies that fund them. While employers determine how to actually roll out their new travel policies, weighing issues related to privacy and taxes, they’re also facing the prospect of legal challenges.
“The employers we’ve been counseling are looking at it all different ways and trying to minimize the risk to everyone,” said Amy Gordon, an employee benefits partner at the law firm Winston & Strawn.
Ms. Dietrich, in West Virginia, had to quit her food service job last year because of health issues related to another pregnancy. Her employer at the time didn’t offer maternity leave. She wants to help her daughter find a workplace that’s more caring — and they’re starting by looking at those that will cover abortion-related travel.
“It shows they’re listening to workers,” she said. “They’re saying, ‘Hey, look, I will help you to get where you need. You’re not trying to figure it out yourself.’”"

Re “America the Merciless,” by Pamela Paul (column, June 27):
Ms. Paul asks how we could have become such a cruel and merciless country when the majority of us favor compassion and mercy. The answer is that this country isn’t set up on the basis of majority rule.
We have small rural states with two senators that together have more voting power than large urban states, also with two senators. We have an Electoral College system that favors small rural states. We have a Republican Party that has become more and more authoritarian, violent and vindictive. We have a Democratic Party that is chronically unable to stand up to bullies.
I share Ms. Paul’s hope that the good we have will overcome the evil in us.
Myrna Lueck
Ypsilanti, Mich.
To the Editor:
Essays like this one from Pamela Paul are decidedly unhelpful in describing our country, since for every instance she cites there are many others that demonstrate our neighborliness and generosity. For example, the same country of unmatched gun violence is unmatched in charitable donations.
America is not merciless; America has problems like every other country. This compulsion to indict its character is too common among the left and may be acceptable in the academy, but it grates outside the ivy walls.

To the Editor:
Pamela Paul’s question “How do we celebrate on the Fourth of July a country whose laws and institutions so often fail to bring out the best in us?” prompts me to decide, sadly and after several years evading the issue, to withhold displaying the colors this coming Fourth — a Colin Kaepernick variant, so to speak."
2022-07-04,"“In order to do my job,” Ben Stiller, as Tom Cruise’s stunt double Tom Crooze, muses in a video made for the 2000 MTV Movie Awards, “I have to ask myself: Who is Tom Cruise? What is Tom Cruise? Why is Tom … Cruise?”
This is a tricky line of questioning.
Onscreen, Cruise is unmistakably our biggest movie star, as the New York Times reporter Nicole Sperling recently explained — the last true exponent of a century-old studio system that has been steadily eroded by the rising forces of franchise filmmaking and streaming. His powerful charisma and daredevil stunt work have combined, yet again, in his latest hit, “Top Gun: Maverick,” bringing it past the $1 billion mark.
Offscreen, Cruise is elusive. He is the frequent public mouthpiece for a cryptic, controversial religion that seems harder to understand the more he talks about it. He is intensely secretive about the details of his private life. Even when he makes the occasional effort to seem like an ordinary, relatable guy, he winds up sounding like an A.I. approximation of one. Asked by Moviebill magazine to describe his most memorable filmgoing experience, Cruise couldn’t name one. (“I love movies,” he said, very normally.) When asked which team he was rooting for at a Giants-Dodgers game he attended last fall, he replied, “I’m a fan of baseball.”
It can be hard to reconcile these disparate sides. So it is worth considering the question: Who is Tom Cruise?
ADVERTISEMENT

Much of his early success as an actor, through the ’80s and ’90s, was predicated on a certain down-to-earth charm. The sexed-up, troublemaking young Cruise of “Risky Business”; the guileless, endearingly naïve Cruise of “Cocktail”; and the tenacious, morally principled Cruise of “Jerry Maguire” each relied on his ability to convincingly embody the American Everyman, the sympathetic heartthrob the audience could desire or root for. Around the turn of the century, he complicated that image by appearing in more challenging, less accessible films, like “Eyes Wide Shut” and “Magnolia.” Auteurs like Stanley Kubrick and Paul Thomas Anderson helped showcase Cruise as a serious actor, capable of delivering subtle, nuanced performances.
He has moved away from romance, drama and the independent art house. Over the last decade-plus, he has become more firmly entrenched in the action-adventure genre, perfecting the summer tentpole blockbuster. His performances tend to emphasize his easy charisma and powerful athleticism, but Cruise still brings to these roles a touch of the same delicate charm and actorly nuance of his dramatic fare. You see it in the breezy, naturalistic chemistry he shares with Jennifer Connelly in “Maverick,” and in the jaded, world-weary intensity he has carried through the last couple of “Mission: Impossible” sequels. My favorite recent Cruise performance was from the underrated “Edge of Tomorrow” (2014), in which he plays a cowardly, sniveling politician forced to relive the same deadly battle over and over again — a playful sci-fi take on “Groundhog Day” that found the actor playing against type to delightful effect.
But that’s just part of the story. One of the defining features of the last decade of his career is a level of quality control for which he himself is chiefly responsible. It’s not that he is incapable of making a bad movie: “The Mummy” (2017), Universal’s failed attempt to kick off an entire “Dark Universe” of big-budget creature features, made that clear. But recent Cruise films have in common a degree of ambition and enthusiasm that is rare in today’s blockbuster landscape, and when everything works, that effort pays off enormously. You will not see Cruise phoning in a performance. You get the sense that he treats every movie he does these days as if it were the most important one he has ever done.

The results of this commitment have a way of feeling almost miraculous. How could anyone have expected “Top Gun: Maverick,” a sequel to a 35-year-old action movie with a rather cool critical reputation, to be not only far superior to the original film, but also one of the finest action films in many years? But then you read about Cruise’s dogged insistence on keeping everything as real as possible — demanding a minimum of computer-generated effects, forcing himself through arduous flight training, encouraging his co-stars to bear G-force speeds until they literally threw up. Some of Cruise’s co-stars over the years have characterized his obsessiveness as extreme to the point of what sounds like cinematic despotism, and it’s true that it would probably be easier, and cheaper, to do much of this in front of a green screen. But that’s not Cruise. When it comes to this stuff, he cares too much.

“Mission: Impossible” was a slick espionage film, directed by Brian De Palma, based on a TV series from the 1960s. How is it possible that it yielded five sequels, and how is it conceivable that the sequels keep getting better, culminating in “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” (2018), which is pretty much an unqualified masterpiece? (The final two installments, “Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” are due in 2023 and 2024.) Again, the credit should go mainly to Cruise, who, for the sake of our entertainment, will happily climb the world’s tallest building, hold his breath for six and a half minutes, or jump out of an airplane with the cameraman.
But Cruise’s devotion to the movies runs deeper, if that’s possible. It’s a devotion to the Movies with a capital M. As A-list talent flocks to deep-pocketed streamers with blockbuster ambitions, Cruise has remained adamant that he will not make a movie for the likes of Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, refusing to negotiate on the possibility of a V.O.D. premiere for “Maverick” earlier in the pandemic. (“I make movies for the big screen,” he explained.) His interest in preserving that traditional cinematic experience shines through in the colossal scale of the productions themselves, so that when Cruise is looming over you in immense, Imax dimensions, he feels every bit as big as the image. It’s a reminder that so much of what we watch is tailored to the streaming era — a mass of “content” designed to play as well on a phone as on the big screen. For those of us who still care deeply about the cinema and fear for its future, Cruise’s efforts feel invaluable.

It’s also a reminder of why we go to the theater to see Tom Cruise movies — to see Tom Cruise himself. We can still be tempted to the cinema by the names on the marquee, but as franchises have become the dominant force in the business, the persuasive power of those names has declined. The supremacy of proven, bankable intellectual property today over the traditional star system has meant that we are more likely to seek out Spider-Man, Thor and Captain America than Tom Holland, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans; the actor in the cape is more interchangeable than ever. With Cruise movies, that relationship is inverted. Does anyone particularly care about the adventures of Ethan Hunt? (That’s the name of his character in “Mission: Impossible,” in case you forgot.) Hunt is just another name for the man we really care about: Cruise, plain and simple.
Cruise has all of the qualities you want in a movie star and none of the qualities you expect of a human being. As a screen presence, he is singular; as a person, he is inscrutable. But it’s his inscrutability that has allowed him to achieve a sort of clarified, immaculate superstardom, one that exists almost entirely in the movies, uncontaminated by mundane concerns. Cruise the star burns as bright as any of his contemporaries, and far brighter than any who have come up since, in part because he continues to throw more and more of himself into his work and give up less and less of himself everywhere else. Who is he? You have to look to the movies to find out."

The night our world changed, I was in a copper baron’s palatial Adirondack home, writing about the history of the poorhouse. That afternoon, with the stained-glass reflections of autumn colors blazing through my window, I pored over an 1832 vendue contract auctioning the care of three female paupers to the lowest bidder in Sandown, N.H.
I had taken a year’s unpaid leave from teaching at the State University of New York at Albany to write a book about technology and poverty. It was the first book I’d written for a popular press, the first written as a journalist rather than a scholar. I knew I had chosen risk: insecure income, shifting health insurance, a left turn from my career path that might not pay off.
During my monthlong writing residency, I had no cell service, so I struck up an epistolary romance with Jason, my partner of 11 years. He told me about his dreams: a tiny U.F.O. banging against his shins, failing to abduct him; a nightmare about killing someone and fleeing the law. I confessed my discomfort with the retreat: I was writing about the 19th-century exploitation of the poor, the very people ground into mortar to build the storied estate where I was staying.
On Oct. 8, 2015, I stepped out onto the veranda, in a vest and scarf against the cold. The fiery colors of the near-peak leaves had vanished, giving way to the night sky. I threw my head back in hopes of glimpsing a meteor shower. But the clouds obscured the Draconids, so at about 10 p.m., I went to the basement computers to check my email.

My ears buzzed and my breath caught. I staggered to the residents’ phone booth. Rubbing my fingers nervously over the graffiti scratched by decades of artists into 100-year-old planks, I dialed Jason’s cell number, and his father answered. They were together. Jason was stable. But his jaw was broken in three places. A cheekbone broken. An eye socket.

I was ready to jump into my ancient pickup and rattle home, but Jason’s dad deterred me. As much as I wanted to rush to his side, there was nothing I could do before morning but watch him sleep. If my truck broke down along the Northway, I would be stranded.
I left the woods as the sun was rising the next day and arrived home to learn the details. Several men had beaten Jason unconscious less than two blocks from our home in Troy, the small city in upstate New York where we live. He was walking back from the corner store with Zebra Cakes and Camel Lights, and someone asked for a cigarette. When he turned to respond, he was hit the first time. He thinks there were four or five guys, all or mostly white, probably in their 20s and 30s. But he can’t be sure. He remembers just flashes: shoes in a circle around his head, waking up in the folding chair, a jagged moment of light and sound during the ambulance ride."
2022-07-06,"Under earnings pressure after a big loss last year, the food distribution company Grubhub struck a deal with Amazon on Wednesday, offering restaurant delivery services without a fee for Amazon Prime members.
As of Wednesday, the premium service, called Grubhub+, is now a free perk for Amazon Prime customers. Here is what we know.
What is Grubhub+?
Grubhub+ is a membership service, introduced in 2020, that costs $9.99 a month. It cancels delivery fees on orders that total $12 or more before taxes, tips and other fees. Amazon Prime members (including those who are already Grubhub+ members) will get a free year of Grubhub+.
How can the offer be redeemed?
Amazon Prime members can redeem the Grubhub+ membership by first going to amazon.com/prime/offer/grubhub/prime-deal and signing into their accounts.
Customers should then click on “Activate free Grubhub+.” The next screen will ask Prime members to sign in or create an account with Grubhub’s screen. Users can also sign in the same way if they have a Seamless or Seamless+ account.
After agreeing to terms and conditions, and agreeing to share proof of their Prime membership to Grubhub, customers can use the perk.

Why was this deal made?
The pandemic initially gave a boost to food service businesses like Grubhub, the company suffered losses in 2021 — about $410 million. But the lifting of pandemic restrictions throughout the country drove down demand for restaurant delivery.
Labor shortages and increased government regulations also contributed to Grubhub’s difficulties.

Good morning. It’s Thursday. Today we’ll look at the nuts and bolts of the Hudson River tunnel project that just cleared a major hurdle, and why it’s so important to New York, New Jersey and even the country. And we’ll dig into the money and transparency problems the city comptroller just revealed in New York’s ferry system.

It was big news this week when the governors of New York and New Jersey agreed to split their share of the initial $14 billion cost of the Gateway project, which aims to double the capacity of trains running under the Hudson River. To politics-watchers, it was a breakthrough in one of those yearslong wrangles that weigh down so many ambitions for the region.
But why does it matter to the rest of us? I’d lost track, so I asked my Times colleague Patrick McGeehan, who’s followed the story.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
First of all, what even is the Gateway Project?
Gateway’s main purpose is to expand capacity for trains between New York City and New Jersey, primarily for commuters. The centerpiece is to dig two single-track tunnels — one going in, one going out, to match the existing pair, which are 112 years old.
In order to do that, though, things have to happen on both sides of the river. In New Jersey, they need to lay some new tracks and replace the Portal Bridge over the Hackensack River. It’s a swinging drawbridge, and it keeps getting stuck when they open it. They have to hammer it back into place with a sledgehammer.
Wow. Is that a common cause of delays?
The words that New Jersey commuters don’t want to hear are “the Portal Bridge.” There’s no good news about the Portal Bridge. (Except for one thing: That work has actually started.)
On the New York side, Penn Station needs to be expanded to handle more trains.
Wait, didn’t we just redo Penn Station?
What they did was turn the old post office into a big beautiful train hall — without adding any actual train capacity.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
So Gateway is obviously great for commuters from New Jersey. What’s in it for us New Yorkers?
Expanding Penn Station adds more options for transit in and around New York City. Metro North trains, which run up the Hudson and along Long Island Sound through Westchester to Connecticut, could connect to Penn. Some trains could some even run all the way through, from Long Island to New Jersey and back.
You could make all the trains go to all the places people want to go, is another way to put it. Instead of the fragmented system we have now, where Metro North, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road don’t connect or even converge on a single hub.
Does it help people who never take trains?
More people will be able to get into New York to work, shop, go to the theater and spend money. That contributes to the city economy, even if many riders live outside.
And they won’t be driving their cars in — that’s key for improving our air and unclogging our streets and responding to the climate crisis, right?
Yes. The trains we have even now are considerably greener than the alternatives. But given how many snags there could still be, buses may be electrified before Gateway gets built!
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Can’t we have both?
Maybe someday!
So why do people think this time Gateway could really happen?
The key difference right now is the Biden administration loves infrastructure and Biden likes trains — Amtrak Joe — so the audience in Washington is more receptive than any time in the last 20 years. It’s all aligned right now for getting the federal funding they need — many billions. (The total estimated cost is $30 billion.)
The danger is, it looks like Democrats may not be in control after December. To put it mildly, there isn’t broad support among Republicans, especially from the middle of the country, for a project that’s (a) trains and (b) in New York.
Can’t they say it’s in New Jersey? Would that work?
It’s still a blue state project and an expensive one. But the Biden administration has lots of money in the infrastructure bill that could go to Gateway directly or through Amtrak. They could get the money committed this year. But they’ve got to move fast.
In your story, you said this project has national significance. Why?
After they started planning, the existing tunnels were flooded by Hurricane Sandy. They’re constantly working piecemeal to fix lingering problems and shore the tunnels up generally. It’s one reason for delays.
If there’s no new tunnels built, eventually one might need to be fully closed for repairs. That would mean one train at a time, taking turns going in opposite directions. That would slow down the whole East Coast transportation system significantly.
But with Gateway, once the new tunnels are in, they could close the old ones for full repairs and eventually have four working tunnels.

NYC Ferry: Scenic rides, messy bookkeeping
Image

J. David Ake/Associated Press
Brad Lander, the New York city comptroller, couldn’t help himself. Before making his announcement about NYC Ferry, the system that runs ferries in the East and Hudson Rivers and to Rockaway in Queens, he quoted at length from “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry.” In the poem, Walt Whitman, bard of the metropolis, tells of a bustling 19th-century waterborne commute that sounds in spirit just like today’s.
Visions of New York restoring the harbor, which first made it rich and powerful, to a central place in its citizens’ lives help explain the attraction of a revamped ferry system. It appealed especially to former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who lavished attention and money on the project.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But Mr. Lander, my colleague Ana Ley reports, was on the pier to declare that the vision had gone, in part, awry. His 50-page audit found that the semi-independent city agency in charge of the ferry program, the Economic Development Corporation, failed to report nearly a quarter-billion dollars in costs.
The report cites record-keeping problems, as well as excessive payments to, and insufficient oversight of, Hornblower, the private company that operates the ferries.
Fred D’Ascoli, the E.D.C.’s chief financial officer, said in a letter that any problems should be remedied, but that the report has misconstrued some information.
The ferry system has been criticized for operating with a much higher subsidy per ride than other public transit, and for failing to integrate with subway and bus systems or serve many low-income riders. But Mr. Lander cited more basic problems, like the E.D.C.’s overpaying Hornblower for one boat by $2.8 million and never asking for a refund.
Mr. de Blasio said in a statement: “The ferry system’s continuation and growth is vital for New York City. We need more affordable, accessible transit options connecting the five boroughs now more than ever.”

2022-08-02,"A rabbi from Buenos Aires pounds the pavement to raise money for his community center in “Shalom Taiwan,” a film whose meager plot could use a bit of a boost itself. After finding little support on a fund-raising trip to New York, Rabbi Aaron (Fabián Rosenthal) ventures out to Taiwan on a hunch, and routine culture-clash content and sightseeing montages ensue.
The story, partly by design, is a series of anticlimactic encounters, as Rabbi Aaron pitches the merits of his newly renovated center to prospective donors. One meeting in Taipei takes place on the careening rides of an amusement park, another among verdant tea groves in the serenity of the countryside.
Rabbi Aaron’s good-natured wife (Mercedes Funes) grows impatient with his absences, and the ticktock plot keeps checking in with the community center as it faces takeover by a creditor. The rabbi’s milquetoast assistant is in charge during his travels, but the film’s director, Walter Tejblum, doesn’t do much with that or other potentially humorous (or dramatic) setups. Rosenthal’s balky presence and Tejblum’s indifferent direction together ward off a sense of urgency or deep engagement.

Rabbi Aaron finds a kindly soul in a Spanish-speaking clerk (Sebastián Hsu) at the capsule hotel where he’s staying, and the movie coasts to an ending about accepting life’s vicissitudes and moving on.

On the agenda: chips and geopolitics.

Pelosi means business
Speaker Nancy Pelosi left Taiwan today after a short visit that could have major repercussions. It drew unusual support from Republicans, condemnation from Beijing and quiet defiance from her hosts in the face of Chinese threats. But China experts predict more fallout may be ahead for businesses and investors from a trip that tested China’s appetite for confrontation.
“The world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy,” Pelosi said today during a meeting with Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen. “America’s determination to preserve democracy here in Taiwan and around the world remains ironclad.” Economic growth and trade were among her agenda items — along with the pandemic, climate change, human rights and democratic governance — but these were overshadowed by geopolitics and China’s fury at her visit to a self-governing island it considers its territory.
Among many other things, the trip was about chips. Pelosi spoke today with Mark Liu, the chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s biggest chip maker. T.S.M.C. is building a plant in Arizona, and Pelosi and Liu reportedly discussed the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act, which offers subsidies to companies that open U.S. chip plants (more on that below).

China’s business backlash to Pelosi’s visit included banning some fish and fruit imports from Taiwan, but the broader impact could reach U.S. shores. Bloomberg reported that China’s CATL, the world’s biggest maker of batteries for electric cars, delayed its decision on a North American factory because of “tensions” surrounding the trip. Semiconductor company stocks slipped yesterday on mounting fears of conflict — especially China’s plan to hold live-fire military drills in areas encircling Taiwan starting Thursday. Liu of T.S.M.C. warned in a CNN interview this week that war over Taiwan threatens to disrupt the geopolitical landscape and the global economy, citing the effect of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Robinhood lays off nearly a quarter of its staff. The company’s brokerage app surged in popularity at the start of the pandemic, but it is now losing customers, including 1.9 million active monthly users in the second quarter. Separately, New York State regulators announced that they were fining Robinhood’s crypto unit $30 million over violations of anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations.
Senators will propose a new regulator for Bitcoin and Ether. The legislation, backed by leaders of the agricultural committee, would make the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the chief regulator of the two largest cryptocurrencies. The S.E.C. has recently stepped up its crypto enforcement, arguing that many digital assets should be regulated like stocks and other investments.
Forbes is up for grabs. The company said it was exploring a sale after a deal to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company was scrapped in May. Forbes is seeking a buyer at a time when digital media companies are out of favor with investors, and when the value of SPAC transactions has plunged 90 percent.

The CHIPS Act has strings attached
Lawmakers used a shelved plan by Intel meant to expand its chip manufacturing capacity by taking over an abandoned factory in Chengdu, China, as an argument for passing the CHIPS and Science Act, The Times’s Ana Swanson reports. The legislation, which contains $52 billion in subsidies and tax credits for global chip manufacturers that establish or expand operations in the U.S., will hand significant power over the private sector to the Commerce Department.
“This is not a blank check to these companies,” said Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary. “There are a lot of strings attached and a lot of taxpayer protections.” Her department has the authority to review future company investments in China and to claw back funds from any firm that it deems to have broken its rules, as well as the ability to make certain updates to the rules for foreign investment as time goes by.
China’s increasing dominance of key global supply chains has generated new support among Republicans and Democrats for the government to nurture strategic industries. South Korea, Japan, the European Union and other governments have outlined aggressive plans to woo semiconductor factories. And the production of many advanced semiconductors in Taiwan has become for many an untenable security threat. “The question really needs to move from why do we pursue an industrial strategy to how do we pursue one,” said Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The bill still has plenty of critics. In focusing its restrictions on newer generations of semiconductors, the legislation could leave the door open for China to dominate the production of older chips that are used in cars and other consumer products. Some Republicans, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, say the guardrails aren’t strong enough to prevent U.S. technology from leaking to China. Some Democrats and their allies, like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, describe the bill as a corporate giveaway.
How efficiently will the funds be spent? The disbursement of tens of billions of dollars in the coming years is likely to raise many questions about how those investments are allocated. And it may touch off more jostling among semiconductor companies that spent more than $20 million on lobbying in the first half of this year alone, according to their disclosures. A 10-year ban on investments in more cutting-edge facilities in China has been particularly contentious, with firms arguing that it would make them less competitive globally and ultimately set the U.S. back in a race against Chinese competitors. But there are signs that the ban is already having an effect: Two South Korean chip makers are reportedly rethinking their investments in China.

An antitrust horror story
There is a ghost lurking in the background of Penguin Random House’s proposed $2.2 billion deal to buy its rival Simon & Schuster, writes our colleague Shira Ovide, the author of The Times’s subscriber-only newsletter On Tech. (Spoiler alert: It’s Amazon.)
Yesterday, Stephen King, the best-selling author known for his horror books, testified in support of the lawsuit filed by the Justice Department to block the merger. It’s one of several efforts by the Biden administration to stem what it has said is excessive concentration in the U.S. economy.
The administration says the merger will hurt authors. The deal will shrink the number of large American publishers of mass-market books to four from five. King testified that the options for authors to get published have decreased since he started selling books in the mid-1970s. With fewer imprints competing, King said, advances have slowly dwindled, particularly for writers without a track record of sales. The merger of two of the country’s largest publishers would make it even harder for writers to earn a living, he said.
But, Ovide argues, the trial is haunted by the specter of Amazon. “Book publishers want to become bigger and stronger partly to have more leverage over Amazon, by far the largest seller of books in the United States,” she wrote. “One version of Penguin Random House’s strategy boils down to this: Our book publishing monopoly is the best defense against Amazon’s book selling monopoly.”

Companies have long tried to justify acquisitions by saying they are trying to level the playing field.
When AT&T bought Time Warner, part of its rationale was that it wanted to become an alternative to digital advertising powers like Google and Facebook.
Music companies have consolidated over the past 15 years, in part to have more sway over digital services like Spotify.
Even Penguin Random House was formed out of a merger that a decade ago was justified as one answer to Amazon’s influence over book sales.
Nonetheless, Ovide says, another mega-merger is unlikely to solve the book business’s concentration problem. Competition experts told her that the best way to deal with Amazon’s dominance in books is not to allow publishers to become monopolists themselves, but to deal with Amazon’s outsize power with laws, regulations and enforcement. There’s growing bipartisan support for such a move, but don’t hold your breath.
“This legal case about book publishing is a window onto deep-rooted problems in the U.S. economy,” Ovide wrote. Those problems “took decades to make and will take a long time to change.”

Amazon’s tax bill could balloon.

The bean counters who may get superpowers
The Senate could vote as soon as this week on a climate and tax bill that, if passed, would hand a good deal of power to an obscure group of accountants in Norwalk, Conn.
Yesterday a bipartisan group of former Treasury secretaries, including Hank Paulson and Timothy Geithner, endorsed the bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, saying it would fight inflation and address climate issues. The group also said the legislation was “financed by a prudent tax policy.”
Much of the bill will be funded by a 15 percent minimum tax on corporate profits. That’s meant to address a longstanding problem: Many profitable companies, including giants like Amazon, pay little to no federal income taxes, taking advantage of legitimate tax breaks, but also using strategies that many believe are solely about avoiding taxes. The legislation would require companies that make over $1 billion in profit a year to pay no less than 15 percent of their “book income” — the amount they report to shareholders but not to the I.R.S. — in federal income taxes. That figure would be adjusted for various factors, including foreign taxes and R.&D. credits.
Here’s where the accounting officials come in. Nearly 50 years ago, the S.E.C. gave responsibility for writing and updating its “generally accepted accounting principles,” which determine how quarterly and annual profits are calculated, to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a private organization funded by corporations and overseen by a nonprofit group, the Financial Accounting Foundation. F.A.S.B. — which those in the know pronounce “fazbie” — is run by a seven-member board of accountants and professional investors. Under the new tax regime, one way to tweak corporate America’s tax bill would be to get F.A.S.B. to rewrite how companies calculate their profits, which is squishier than you might think.

So what do we know about the accounting rule makers and the leaders of the foundation that oversees them, who could all of a sudden have a big say in tax policy?
They are politically connected. Kathleen Casey, who is the head of the nominating committee for F.A.S.B.’s board members, is a former S.E.C. commissioner and a former chief of staff for Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who has long called for lower taxes for corporations and the wealthy.
They are well compensated. Richard Jones, a former top executive of the accounting firm Ernst & Young who left it to be the chair of F.A.S.B., was paid a base salary of $1 million last year, according to a tax filing.
They are not diverse. The board is made up of four white men and three white women. A spokesman for F.A.S.B. told DealBook that the organization, which was founded in 1973, has never had a board member of color.
F.A.S.B.’s chair has previously opposed a minimum corporate tax. Last year, Jones said in a speech that he was against basing a minimum corporate tax on book income. He said the group’s role was to set accounting rules that best convey the health of a company. Using book income to determine tax payments would inject public policy into financial accounting, Jones said, making it hard for his organization to do its job. “It would be an additional pressure, there’s no doubt, on our mission and what we do,” he said.

Taiwan scrambles to reroute commercial air and sea traffic. China, retaliating against its neighbor for allowing Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit this week, fired missiles into waters off Taiwan and created an effective blockade that risks shattering a fragile peace in the region. In South Korea today, Pelosi avoided direct comments about China and Taiwan.
Stocks snap back from a losing streak. The major indexes all made gains yesterday, with the S&P 500 up 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq Composite gaining 2.6 percent. Analysts pointed to robust earnings and a report showing that the U.S. services sector continued to expand in July. Stock futures are flat this morning.

A subpoena blitz in Twitter vs. Musk
Yesterday, Twitter and Elon Musk sent out another blast of subpoenas as they rev up into the discovery mode of their legal battle. Among those Musk subpoenaed were Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, the banks advising Twitter on its deal to sell itself to Musk. And Twitter, for its part, has sent subpoenas to several people in Musk’s inner circle, as it investigates when — and how — he decided to abandon the deal.

Here’s a look at just some of those on Musk’s side, including much of the PayPal mafia, who were put on notice.
David Sacks: The venture capitalist and founding chief operating officer of PayPal tweeted that he had received a subpoena asking for more information on his tweets about the deal. Sacks co-hosted a conference in May at which Musk expressed one of his first concerns about Twitter’s bots and implied that he might want a deal at a lower price. And Sacks spoke about the deal on Megyn Kelly’s podcast. A spokeswoman for Sacks did not have a comment.
Joe Lonsdale: “I have nothing to do with this aside from a few snarky comments, but got a ‘YOU ARE HEREBY COMMANDED’ document notice,” the co-founder of Palantir tweeted. On CNBC in June, Lonsdale said: “Elon was probably pretty shocked to see they don’t actually know these numbers. And it’s pretty scary to buy something when you don’t know the numbers.” He also noted the broader market decline since the deal was struck, but said he had not discussed this point with Musk. A spokeswoman for Palantir did not respond to a request for comment.
Founders Fund: The venture firm is led by Peter Thiel, who also helped found PayPal and Palantir and has called himself a good friend of Musk. Thiel did not invest in Musk’s Twitter deal, but it is possible that Twitter suspects that Musk, at the very least, spoke to him about it. A spokeswoman for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.
Also on the list: The Linda Ye and Robin Ren Family Foundation (Robin Ren is a former top Tesla executive); Tesla and SpaceX, both companies that Musk runs; Brookfield, which committed equity to the deal; Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel; and dozens of others.

Birdies, bogeys and antitrust
Eleven golfers on the Saudi-financed LIV Golf series challenged their suspensions from the PGA Tour yesterday in an antitrust lawsuit that reflects growing pressure to give athletes more autonomy. The suit argues that the PGA Tour is unfairly controlling players with anti-competitive restraints to protect its longstanding monopoly on professional golf.
“We’ve brought this action on behalf of professional golfers to vindicate their rights to play where and when they choose and to ensure professional golf innovates and grows,” John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said in a statement to DealBook.

The LIV Golf circuit is bankrolled by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. It poached several prominent players from the PGA Tour with mammoth upfront payments and appearance fees. Phil Mickelson, a six-time major-tournament winner, reportedly received $200 million. The circuit has become a lightning rod for human rights campaigners who accuse Saudi Arabia of using sports to launder its reputation.
The Tour is “an entrenched monopolist with a vice-grip on professional golf,” the complaint argues. Before LIV Golf’s recent entry on the scene, elite golfers “had no meaningful option” but to work with the Tour, according to the athletes’ lawyers. Now that LIV is luring them with big prizes, the Tour is punishing those “who have the temerity to defy the Tour and play in tournaments sponsored by the new entrant,” they argue.
The Tour may argue that the renegade golfers are “free-riding.” The organization has invested time and money and given golfers a platform to build their careers, said K. Craig Wildfang, an antitrust law expert and a former special counsel to the Justice Department’s antitrust division. Wildfang, who is not involved in the case, says it could potentially take years to resolve. The PGA Tour did not respond to DealBook’s request for comment.
Athletes may have the wind at their backs. The pro golfers argue that the Tour’s illegal restrictions limit their ability to earn, a sentiment reflected in similar challenges playing out in other sports. Members of the U.S. women’s soccer team sued the country’s soccer federation for gender discrimination, scoring a settlement this year. Student athletes have been chipping away at an N.C.A.A. payments ban, and swimmers have been fighting an antitrust battle against their sport’s governing body.

2022-08-05,"WASHINGTON — Critics of the country’s largest tech companies branded the last few months “Hot Antitrust Summer” because they hoped that Congress would vote on new regulations for Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.
The legislation’s chances of passing before Labor Day melted away instead. The Senate is expected to take up one last major matter of business before its August recess, debating and voting on the Democrats’ large climate, tax and health care package.
The failure to secure a vote is a setback for the politicians, activists and regulators who believe that Big Tech has too much control over commerce, communications and culture. After Labor Day, Washington will turn much of its attention to the midterm elections instead of major legislation. And if Republicans regain the majority in Congress, the regulations have a far smaller chance of being taken up.
“One of the senators actually said to me, ‘Maybe you’re just ahead of your time,’” Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and the main driver of the legislation, said in an interview. “And I said to them, ‘Yeah, but being ahead of your time doesn’t mean that your time hasn’t come.’ And at some moment your time comes.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Supporters of Ms. Klobuchar’s bill, called the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, argue that a national update to antitrust law would allow smaller businesses to thrive by reining in big tech companies. The bill would bar the companies from prioritizing their own services over those of their rivals. So Amazon, for example, could not show its own Amazon Basics batteries before those made by Duracell, and Google might have to put its own restaurant reviews on par with sites like Yelp in search results.
The bill’s backers cheered in May when Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader, said privately that he would put it up for a vote early in the summer. It was approved by the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, and Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, her primary Republican co-sponsor, said they had the votes for the legislation to succeed if the full Senate voted on it.
The tech companies poured tens of millions of dollars into lobbying against the bill. Groups funded by the companies put ads on the air in swing states, saying the legislation was ill-advised at a time of rampant inflation. The chief executives of Google, Apple and Amazon all personally lobbied against the bill.

The industry also argued that there could be unintended consequences for speech online, as the bill could be interpreted as also limiting how much these companies can moderate content, including hateful posts. The bill’s supporters say their concerns are unfounded, but four Democratic senators in June called for amending the bill to ensure it was not misinterpreted.

They argued that if lawmakers had to vote on the bill, it would pass. But last month at a fund-raiser, Mr. Schumer said he didn’t believe the measure had the 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. And he said he would not put it on the floor until he had a better sense that it could pass, said a person with knowledge of his comments, who would speak only anonymously because the discussion was private. Mr. Schumer’s comments were first reported by Bloomberg.
“All I can tell you is that Klobuchar was very disappointed when she was led to believe it was going to be brought up in this time frame and it’s not brought up, and we don’t have a lot of time between now and the election,” Mr. Grassley said in an interview.
Other priorities in the Senate like the climate, energy and tax package brokered between Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Mr. Schumer have also brushed antitrust matters aside. Before the surprise reconciliation deal on that bill, slow work on a veteran health care bill, a sweeping gun control measure and a chip manufacturing bill dominated the legislative calendar.
Some of the bill’s co-sponsors said the bill was a low priority for them as they prepared to leave Capitol Hill for the month. Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, said she was focusing on legislation that was being discussed before the August recess.

Ms. Klobuchar said that she had spoken with Mr. Schumer and discussed putting the bill up for a vote in the fall.
“I think he’s committed to working on this and getting this through,” she said. There is also a similar proposal in the House of Representatives that has bipartisan support.
A spokesman for Mr. Schumer said in a statement that the majority leader was “working with Senator Klobuchar and other supporters to gather the needed votes and plans to bring it up for a vote.”
Sarah Miller, the executive director of the liberal American Economic Liberties Project, said that should the efforts to pass a new antitrust law in Washington fizzle, it would only make the role of agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, which sued to block Meta’s acquisition of a virtual reality company last month, and state lawmakers more important in reining in Big Tech.
“Fortunately there’s not only one sheriff in town,” she said, “although I think Congress’s ability to directly promote fairness and competition in digital markets will continue to be an essential project.”"

1. President Biden will accuse Republicans of embracing extremism in a prime-time speech tonight.
In his speech, which he will deliver at 8 p.m. in Philadelphia, Biden plans to accuse “MAGA Republicans” loyal to Donald Trump of putting the nation’s institutions at risk and undermining democratic values, according to the White House.
The speech will send a dark message about threats to the fabric of American democracy, a theme similar to the ones that Biden has said drove him to run for the presidency. But with just nine weeks before the midterm elections, aides said Biden would also try to offer optimism.

3. California is taking aggressive steps to fight global warming.
The state dedicated a record $54 billion to spending on climate measures. Lawmakers also passed related bills that prevent the state’s last nuclear power plant from closing, sharpen restrictions on drilling and mandate that the state stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2045.
The actions came after a climate bill signed last month by President Biden, which experts have said would not alone be enough to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gases by 2050. They also marked a victory for Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has sought to portray himself as a climate leader while raising his national profile — and drawing speculation about a possible White House run.

4. Climate change has emerged as a growing threat to drinking water nationwide.
Flash floods, wildfires and hurricanes are increasingly common, and are threatening the U.S.’s aging infrastructure and leaving cities without safe water.
This week’s crisis in Mississippi — in which floods overwhelmed the treatment plants in Jackson, leaving 150,000 people without clean water — was the latest example. Earlier this summer, more than 25,000 people lost their access to water after deadly floods ripped through eastern Kentucky, and record heat caused hundreds of water-main breaks in Texas.
In Jackson, the governor declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard for help. Many in the majority-Black city believe its needs have been neglected for years.

In a 48-page report accusing China of committing grave human rights abuses in its western Xinjiang region, the U.N. authoritatively backed claims that Uyghur activists have been making for years.
Many activists had feared that the U.N. high commissioner for human rights would pull punches in exchange for access and better ties with Beijing.

The setbacks, which could have lasting consequences as students seek to move past elementary school basics, were also more significant among Black students, who lost 13 points in math, compared with five points among white students.

10. And finally, a strategy for decorating an empty home.
If you’ve ever moved into a new space, you may understand the urge to fill it all at once. But that’s probably not a great idea, because you risk ending up with a showroom look.
Instead, aim for a home that looks like it was assembled over time. And the best way to achieve that is to take some time. Find pieces you love and want to keep around, and enjoy the process of discovery. Start with a sofa, a coffee table and maybe a dresser, and take inspiration from there.

2022-09-02,"Season 1, Episodes 1-2: ‘A Shadow of the Past’ and ‘Adrift’
Five years ago, Amazon bought the television rights to J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings,” committing to spend around a billion dollars — at least — to make a five-season prestige drama series, set thousands of years before the events in Tolkien’s novels. Since then, Tolkien fans have obsessed over every tease of the show’s possible story lines and characters. Meanwhile, industry-watchers have questioned whether Amazon’s Prime Video service can deliver a “Game of Thrones”-level action-fantasy event.
Now that the first two episodes of “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” are finally available to Prime Video subscribers, we have some answers to long-lingering questions. Do they live up to director Peter Jackson’s Oscar-winning “Lord of the Rings” movies? Are they too high-fantasy for casual TV viewers? Too dumbed-down for Tolkien devotees?
The quick take? This series, so far, is solidly entertaining, with a big-budget luster, some well-drawn characters, and an intricately woven narrative that shows plenty of promise. “The Rings of Power” has a grand scope, taking place in familiar and unfamiliar lands within Middle-earth and beyond, with plotlines involving elves, dwarves, humans and a Hobbit-adjacent group called the Harfoots.
The longer take? Well, we’ll be getting into that here each week, starting with the exposition-heavy first chapter and the more action-driven second one. This feature is intended as a handy companion to some of the show’s most memorable moments and key plot points, summarizing and analyzing what stands out over the course of Season 1’s eight episodes.

Here are seven takeaways from the first two episodes of “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.”
No Tolkien knowledge? No problem.
Part of what made the “Lord of the Rings” movie trilogy a success was that Jackson and his team simplified Tolkien’s saga, beginning with a prologue that explained what viewers needed to know. Long ago there was a grand battle between the evil Lord Sauron’s armies and a coalition of heroic humans and elves, and in the aftermath an all-powerful ring fell into the wrong hands, so now it must be taken to a volcano and destroyed. And we’re off!
“The Rings of Power” similarly sets the stage cleanly and clearly. Once again we’re in the distant past, where the elves keeping Middle-earth safe have determined that Sauron (still our Big Bad) and his orc soldiers are no longer a pressing threat. It feels like it is time to move on … until a string of strange occurrences in the first episode leaves some wondering if there’s still evil-fighting to be done.
There may be some benefit to remaining Tolkien-neutral when it comes to “The Rings of Power.” Though the series draws on the author’s detailed notes about his fantasy realm, the showrunners, J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay, are not allowed to adapt any narrative material or characters that appeared in posthumous Tolkien works like “The Silmarillion.” Instead the basic premise comes from the histories in the appendices of “The Lord of the Rings,” embellished with new characters.
It’s diverse but not entirely colorblind.
One thing Tolkien fans noticed during the “Rings of Power” casting announcements was that — in keeping with the larger effort in modern media to diversify casting — there are many more Black and brown faces in this show than in Jackson’s movies. Most of the time, the difference in skin tones seen within races like dwarves and Harfoots isn’t presented as a big deal.

But it does matter that one of the major characters, Arondir (Ismael Cruz Córdova), is a darker-skinned Silvan elf. This elven subset lives and toils close to the humans in Middle-earth rather than residing either in the glittering faraway kingdom of Eldamar or in the Middle-earth enclave of Lindon — where the fair-skinned, light-haired, immortal elves make all the decisions. It also matters that Arondir has a romantic connection with Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi), a human healer who works near a village of Sauron sympathizers in the Southlands.

It’s hard to avoid comparing the TV “Lord of the Rings” with the much-hyped “House of the Dragon,” given that both are pricey prequels, derived from beloved works of fantasy fiction, arriving at the same time. (Also: Part of the back story of “The Rings of Power” is Jeff Bezos’ decree that he wanted Amazon to have its own “Game of Thrones.”) But for the most part, “House of the Dragon” is its own kind of show, irrelevant to any discussion of “The Rings of Power.”
That said, anyone who loved “Thrones” will find it hard not to notice how “The Rings of Power” keeps viewers oriented by zooming across a cool-looking computer-animated map, much like in the HBO hit’s opening credits. And unlike “House of the Dragon” — which so far has kept most of its action confined to one or two locations — “The Rings of Power” spreads its story around. In these first two episodes we spend time with the ancient elves of Valinor and also roam across the Sundering Seas to Middle-earth, where we follow humans in the Southlands, the nomadic Harfoots in their secret camps, the Silvan elves in their fortresses and the dwarves in the underground city of Khazad-dum.
But it’s also nothing like ‘Game of Thrones.’
Tired of all the stomach-turning gore, gratuitous nudity, amoral characters and generally pessimistic tone in Westeros? “The Rings of Power,” while in no way a kiddie show, is much more family-friendly than “House of the Dragon.” As in the Jackson films, the series’s look is bright, colorful and filled with moments of fantastical awe, all set to a rousing blockbuster-like score that combines elements of Howard Shore’s movie themes with new pieces composed by Bear McCreary.
The characters, too, are generally more well-meaning and heroic, and have more upbeat and winning personalities. This doesn’t mean they are saps, or that they always make good choices. Part of the challenge for Payne and McKay — as it was for Tolkien and Jackson — is to tell a story with clearly defined heroes and villains that leaves room for those heroes to be complicated.

A time of peace, uneasily kept.
As I mentioned, when the series begins, the elven armies have had so little to do for so long that many of the rank-and-file are beginning to doubt that Sauron or the orcs are a real threat. The humans in Middle-earth are weary of the elves patrolling their lands and acting haughtily. And back in Lindon, the elven ruling class is giving the heroes of the battles against Sauron’s slain master, Morgoth, the chance to sail into the great light back to their homeland, as a reward for valiant service.
The warrior Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) isn’t sure her job is done though, because she keeps seeing Sauron’s mark everywhere — something she is sensitive to, because her dead brother had the evil one’s logo branded onto his corpse. In a climactic moment at the end of the first episode, Galadriel chooses not to join her comrades, and instead jumps off their boat before the light transports them.
Meanwhile, Galadriel’s half-elf friend Elrond (Robert Aramayo) gets sent on an errand related to a larger elven plan that remains unrevealed so far, but certainly seems like it could be the forging of the powerful rings that will eventually connect this series to Tolkien’s books. Elrond travels to Khazad-dum to talk to his old dwarf buddy, Durin (Owain Arthur), where he discovers that the dwarves are also sick of the elves’ demands. Durin is especially huffy, because Elrond didn’t come to his wedding; he’s only here when the elves need another favor.
In short: Everything seems fine in Middle-earth, but there are underlying tensions among all these races who once stood against Morgoth and Sauron, and there are would-be heroes like Galadriel and Elrond who want to take proactive steps to prevent future trouble — even if those steps cause problems.

There are giants in the sky.
The other big moment at the end of the first episode takes place outside the Harfoot settlement, where a blazing fireball in the sky crash-lands, leaving a huge crater, within which rests the body of a large humanoid (Daniel Weyman). An adventurous Harfoot named Nori (Markella Kavenagh) finds the as-yet-unnamed star-man, who speaks no recognizable language, and who over the course of the second episode demonstrates strange magical powers. At one point this “Stranger” snaps a twig, and back in the Harfoot village Nori’s father snaps an ankle. Later, the Stranger upends a Harfoot lantern and has a mumbling conversation with the fireflies inside.

It is too early to speculate on who or what the Stranger actually is (though it is worth noting that there is a distinct lack of wizards in this show so far). At the moment, his arrival matters in that it gives more screen time to Nori, who is the breakout character in these first two episodes. While the other Harfoot are beholden to the philosophy that “Nobody goes off trail and nobody walks alone,” Nori has grander ambitions, and a sweetness about her that makes her very easy to follow.
There is trouble below.
In Bronwyn’s village, the first sign that something’s not quite right arrives when a cow starts giving milk that looks like black goop. Later, Bronwyn discovers a tunnel bearing scratches on the walls that look like they came from orc claws. Meanwhile, adrift in the Sundering Sea after abandoning ship at the end of the first episode, Galadriel takes refuge on a raft with some humans whose ship was demolished by a leviathan, which slithers ominously underwater beneath them.
The point is: All is not calm in or around Middle-earth. At the end of the second episode, in an incredibly tense sequence (well-staged by the director J.A. Bayona, who handled both of these first two hours well), Bronwyn and her son are hiding in a closet in their home as a gaunt orc in a bone-helmet prowls around. She eventually beheads the beast, and then uses her trophy to urge her people to seek refuge with the elves.
This development, as much as any in “The Rings of Power” so far, marks this story as influenced by Tolkien. No “Lord of the Rings” plot really gets going until the heroes leave home."
2022-09-03,"In HBO’s new hit show “House of the Dragon,” the dragons are bigger, scalier and fire-breathier than they ever were in the network’s culture-changing fantasy epic, “Game of Thrones.” The casual misogyny and disturbing racial tropes of the first series have, however, been turned down a notch.
That’s in response to widespread criticism of how “Thrones” normalized sexual violence and valorized whiteness, the creators of “House of the Dragon,” Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik, have said. The episodes of “House” that have aired so far have focused on the plucky, queer-coded queen in waiting Rhaenyra Targaryen, played by Milly Alcock as an adolescent (and after an upcoming time skip by the nonbinary performer Emma D’Arcy), and her rebellion against patriarchy. Another major character, Lord Corlys Velaryon, is played by the British actor of Barbadian descent Steve Toussaint (a casting choice that has caused some racist backlash). The Japanese-born British actor Sonoya Mizuno has a prominent role. Even crowd scenes and secondary characters display more diversity than the Westeros of “Thrones” did.
And while “House” still features plenty of barbarity toward women — a grotesque obstetric scene in Episode 1 offered a vivid illustration of how little women’s lives are valued in Westeros — the style has been markedly less voyeuristic than the approach that prompted Indiewire’s Libby Hill to call “Game of Thrones” “eight seasons of gratuitous torture porn.” In “House,” scenes of noble girls — including a prepubescent child in one case — offering themselves up as potential royal wives are framed to be unsettling, not seductive. There’s still plenty of sex, violence and gore (and if the show follows the source material, yes, incest is coming), but the lingering camera angles and lascivious framing that were hallmarks of “Thrones” seem to be absent.
Some critics have suggested that the new series is a little dull — “saddled with respectability” and “timid in a weird way.” Others have gone so far as to call it “feminist grooming” and an example of Hollywood’s panic about sensitivity (although miraculously, no one has yet hit upon the phrase “woking the dragon”).

So it’s worth asking: Has toning down some of the more salacious aspects drained the series of its excitement? These were, after all, as much the subject of the Monday-after debates about “Game of Thrones” around the digital water coolers of social media as the show’s intricate plot: Which female characters had been subjected to sexualized humiliation, exploited through casual nudity or simply offed as part of the show’s bloody tapestry of violence against women? Did anyone with a shade of skin darker than bisque show up onscreen, and if so, what manner of brutish savage, manipulative foreigner or exotic courtesan were they?

Will a slightly more sensitive Westeros give us enough to talk about? It’s hard to tell so far. The new series certainly didn’t open with anything quite as gasp-inducing as a pair of twins having sex in a tower, then throwing a child out of a window, as “Thrones” did. And there’s some validity to complaints about how much time “House” spends on “tense bickering at a big table.” But to suggest that a less raunchy Westeros is necessarily less compelling does a disservice to the original series by assuming that sexual brutalization and normative whiteness were its core appeal.

It’s also a rather patronizing assessment of the show’s fans, many of whom weren’t there for the full-frontal nudity and titillation. I’d argue that the success of “Thrones” had more to do with the complex dynamics of its political and family intrigue, its top-tier acting and its immensely detailed world-building — all of which “House” has already offered in abundance.
George R.R. Martin, the author of the source books, who was involved in creating both HBO series, has defended the treatment of race and gender in “Thrones” as grounded in historical reality. He told Entertainment Weekly in 2015: “The books reflect a patriarchal society based on the Middle Ages. The Middle Ages were not a time of sexual egalitarianism.” To a fan wondering why there seemed to be no Asians in the series at all, he responded on his personal blog in 2014: “There weren’t a lot of Asians in Yorkish England either.”

Of course, there weren’t ice zombies, giants or, ahem, dragons in Yorkish England, either. Given that the land of Westeros is a wholly imagined fantasy, it could’ve been anything its creators imagined it to be — and in “Game of Thrones,” a white male author and white male showrunners imagined it as a place where people of color are mostly servile, silent or absent.

But as Mr. Sapochnik and Mr. Condal note, “House of the Dragon” arrives in a very different era. Mr. Condal put it bluntly in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: “It was very important for Miguel and I to create a show that was not another bunch of white people on the screen.” Mr. Sapochnik cited the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements in an interview with Jeremy Egner of The Times: “It’s a radically different world from what it was 10 years ago,” he said. “We have to reflect the changes in the world before us — not because somebody told us to, but because we actually feel like there’s a point.”
The conventions of casting have also seen a shake-up in the last decade. Since “Thrones,” high-profile period dramas such as “Bridgerton” and “The Great” have cast nonwhite actors as European royals and aristocrats — and become hugely popular. The same can be said of several exciting new shows in the fantasy genre. “Wheel of Time,” Amazon Prime’s adaptation of Robert Jordan’s best-selling novels, cast many of its main characters with Black, Asian, Indigenous and Latin actors, and is now rolling toward its third season. The streamer’s even bigger bet, “The Rings of Power,” a billion-dollar prequel to J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings,” has cast Black actors as hobbits and dwarves and Puerto Rican performers as elves, consciously defying the convention of depicting these nonhuman beings as white. And “The Sandman” — which reimagines white characters as Black and male characters as female and cast a nonbinary actor whose gender identity is intrinsically necessary for their role in the plot — may well be the most watched streaming show on the planet right now.
All of these are evidence that embracing a full spectrum of talent options rather than rigidly adhering to historical inspiration doesn’t detract from storytelling or audience interest. Indeed, it’s very likely that more diverse casts have drawn new audiences to these fantasy tent poles, making them more relevant and accessible to viewers who have rarely seen themselves at the center of stories of such epic scale and grandeur.
That makes business sense: The consulting giant McKinsey and Company estimates that a more inclusive Hollywood could generate an additional $10 billion in annual revenues. A 2020 study commissioned by the top talent broker Creative Artists Agency found that shows that premiered with a cast of series regulars that is at least 40 percent nonwhite were significantly more in demand than those with less diverse casts.

And as for “House of the Dragon,” after setting an HBO audience record for a series premiere with 10 million live viewers and then topping that number with its second episode, it has been renewed for a second season. If its story continues to evolve in this direction, a fantasy many of us have had could come true: that female and nonwhite fans can delight in soaring dragons and palace intrigue without feeling burned in the process.

2022-09-05,"Comparisons between HBO’s “House of the Dragon” and Amazon’s “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” — both new epic fantasies, both prequel series, both with huge budgets and ready-made fan bases — were probably inevitable. And indeed the internet has already been more than happy to oblige.
But should we compare them? Possibly not.
The “Thrones” author, George R.R. Martin — whose work was heavily influenced by the original “Rings” author, J.R.R. Tolkien — wants only peace in the realm. “It’s not a death match or anything,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “We don’t have to be bracketed together.”
Still, few seem able to resist the urge. And what are we made of, Valyrian stone?
Instead of comparing industry stats, though — ratings, budgets, and so on — let’s look at where the two shows overlap. Which one has the coolest swords? The best dragons? The most formidable heroine? Granted, initial observations are based on only the first few episodes (three so far for “Dragon”; two for “Rings,” which premiered on Thursday). But we’ve seen enough to get the discussion started. (Some spoilers lie ahead.)
Pop culture cred  
It’s not entirely fair to compare J.R.R. Tolkien to George R.R. Martin, who is often referred to as “the American Tolkien.” The two authors are not in competition. Martin takes inspiration from much of what Tolkien did, especially in the areas of magic and world-building; but he has also expanded on Tolkien’s achievements. Tolkien has sold more books than Martin (they’ve both sold tens of millions), but Tolkien’s have been around much longer.

A better comparison might be the previous adaptations of their work: HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” to which “Dragon” is a prequel, versus Peter Jackson’s film versions of “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit.”
It could be said that the early seasons of “Game of Thrones” were in some ways comparable to the first three (and much-loved) Jackson films, while the derided later seasons of “Thrones” resembled more the polarizing “Hobbit” movies. Each series got off to a great start, but each tested viewers’ patience. Tolkien fans are already finding things to gripe about with the new series, but they’ve have had much more time to get over the “Hobbit” movies. If the monster ratings seen thus far for “Dragon” are any indication, “Thrones” fans seem prepared to forgive (if not forget) for now. But it’s still early, fan reaction to the end of “Thrones” was truly bitter, and the franchise still has a lot of ground to make up.
Edge: “The Rings of Power” 
Heroes 
As prequels go, “Rings of Power” has another advantage because some of its characters are immortal. The trick, of course, is that new actors have to measure up to those playing previous incarnations, some of whom were widely beloved. Morfydd Clark, as an adventurous young Galadriel in “Rings” (played by Cate Blanchett in the movies) manages this quite nicely.
“Dragon” might have taken a similar route if the showrunners had been willing to revisit such long-living “Thrones” characters as Melisandre (Carice van Houten) or the Children of the Forest. But that would have required wedging those characters into the story in places where they didn’t really fit.
Instead, “Dragon” implicitly asks viewers to identify Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock) with Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) and therefore support her claim for the throne. As causes go, that’s not as noble as Galadriel’s quest to extinguish the ultimate evil, or even Dany’s early fight against oppression. Rhaenyra wants only her birthright; and perhaps there’s something heroic in fighting the patriarchy to get it, but so far she’s no Galadriel, even if the blonde wigs make the Targaryens resemble elves.

Swords
’Tis said the sword makes the man — or the woman, or the elf. And sometimes a legendary sword can do more to fuel fear and awe than the individual wielding it.
In “The Rings of Power,” we will presumably get to see some of these storied blades — the sword of Isildur (Maxim Baldry), for example, which is known as Narsil and is weighted with destiny. Meanwhile, what about the broken black hilt that Theo (Tyroe Muhafidin) secretly keeps? It’s a weapon that seems capable of reforging itself and of drinking in blood as well. It resembles the sword Anglachel, also called Gurthang, and that’s not a good thing.
In “House of the Dragon,” we’re in a Golden Age of legendary Valyrian weaponry. King Viserys (Paddy Considine) grips the mighty sword of kings, Blackfyre, when he wants to exert authority, and he holds a familiar dagger when he wants to impart prophecy. (Given the special properties of that dagger’s Valyrian steel, it also has destiny written all over it.) Daemon (Matt Smith), meanwhile, uses the slimmer Dark Sister to cut his way to glory.

Then there’s the Iron Throne, which is made of countless swords and could easily bring down a king with a well-placed nick. Legend has it that this is the way the throne “rejects” those not fit to rule.  
A parallel to Valyrian steel in Tolkien’s world is mithril, the rare and precious metal found only in Khazad-dûm and Númenor — both places visited in “Rings of Power.” Mithril is said to be stronger than steel but also lighter — which raises the obvious question: Why has no one thought to make a mithril sword?

Magic trees
In the beginning — in “The Rings of Power,” at least — there were the Two Trees of Valinor, growing side by side in a mingled glow, until the Dark Lord Morgoth poisoned them. Then, making things worse, Morgoth stole the Silmarils, three jewels containing the unsullied light of those two now-vanished trees. We have also learned that a gift of a sapling continues to blossom even in the deep underground of Khazad-dûm. How? Love? Magic? (Is there a difference?) There are other significant trees, as well, some of them symbolizing the friendship between different species. (Look for one of these if we go to Númenor’s capital.)
So far, the white weirwoods in “House of the Dragon” are little more than a backdrop, a source of soothing shade in the godswood. But it seems likely that these trees are being utilized by someone as some kind of Westerosi surveillance system. (We know there has been a series of Three-Eyed Ravens and greenseers keeping watch.) We probably won’t learn much about that in this season.
Edge: “The Rings of Power”
Dragons
Dragons are the ultimate weapons of war. In the prologue to “The Rings of Power,” we see the evil Morgoth make pioneering use of the winged beasts in battle.
One of his mounts appears to be Ancalagon the Black, an obvious model for another familiar behemoth, Balerion the Black Dread, whose preserved skull is an object of reverence in “House of the Dragon.” Tolkien’s dragons are not pets; taking them out for joy rides would be inadvisable. And they’ll have a more serious role to play in the story once the dwarves get their power jewelry.
But to settle the core issue between the two franchises, which dragons are better? We know from the loquacious Smaug, in the 2013 movie “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,” that Tolkien’s dragons are sentient and thoughtful. One on one, they have serious intellectual assets; but as a group, their meager numbers in Middle-earth during this Second Age are no match for the fire-breathing horde in “House of the Dragon.”
Rhaenyra’s Syrax and Daemon’s Caraxes are just the first of those beasts to be introduced on the show — there’s a whole dragonpit more of them we still haven’t seen.

Invented languages
Given that Tolkien was an actual linguist who created his own Elvish language (Quenya, it’s called), “The Rings of Power” starts off with a distinct advantage over “House of the Dragon” in this category.
Image

Martin (for the books) and the language creator David J. Peterson (for “Dragon”) made valiant effort to achieve something close to what Tolkien did, most notably with High Valyrian, the mother tongue of the Targaryen rulers. If we were to judge each show solely by the artistry of its languages, Tolkien’s Quenya would surely win.
But “Rings of Power” squanders that advantage by barely using Quenya when the elves speak to one another, or Khuzdul among the dwarves, at least in the first two episodes. We hear Elrond (Robert Aramayo) mutter a few words of Elvish to himself when he is writing something, but he switches to the common tongue seconds later.
By contrast, “House of the Dragon” uses High Valyrian to establish a relationship between a Targaryen uncle and niece, and the actors speak it so fluently that the bond feels real.
Edge: “House of the Dragon”
Language, period
Both shows are based on pre-existing material. For “House of the Dragon,” it is Martin’s imaginary history, the book “Fire & Blood.” For “The Rings of Power,” it is mostly appendices to “The Lord of the Rings,” which are essentially story outlines.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Both shows have had to invent quite a bit in order to fill narrative gaps, and here “House of the Dragon” benefits from Martin’s direct involvement as one of the show’s creators. Also, the “House of the Dragon” writers seem much more aware of how to use lines and scenes to stir watercooler discussion and to crank up the old “Thrones” meme factory again. Rhaenyra’s “I never jest about cake” was a bit strained, but people are still talking about the C-section murder from Episode 1.
“The Rings of Power,” so far, is not putting meat back on the menu, boys — and it’s not serving second breakfast, either. But we know Daemon Targaryen will always give us the GIFs.

2022-09-06,"For years, Apple has been a loud critic of online advertising that relies on hogging as much information about us as possible. Now, the company wants to become a bigger seller of online ads, and says it can do so in a less creepy way.
The question is: Can Apple successfully sell online ads without the ick?
This will be a test — with us as real-world subjects — of whether there can be a future of digital advertising that gobbles less of our information, or whether the status quo is too powerful to change.
Apple’s goal is possible, digital advertising experts told me, but it won’t be easy.
Many companies, including Google, Facebook and obscure data middlemen, track our phones wherever we roam, record all the websites and apps we use and match up bits of seemingly small details like how much battery life is left on our phones.
They do this mostly to fine-tune pitches for butt flap pajamas and other stuff, or to sell our data in bulk in ways we can’t imagine.
The digital advertising system is ugly but lucrative, partly because it works. Apple relies far less on these common online methods of tracking, but it might need to bend to this reality if it wants to become a bigger ad player. Plus, Apple’s campaign to crack down on existing ad methods and sell its own ads opens the company to criticism that it’s acting hypocritical.
Let me explain why Apple wants to go bigger in ads, how the company approaches advertising and how our digital experiences might change.

‘The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’ Season 1
Starts streaming: Sept. 1
When J.R.R. Tolkien died, the author of “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” left behind thousands of pages of partial stories and detailed notes, which collectively expanded on the history of his fictional Middle Earth and its surrounding lands, across many cycles of war and peace. The expensive Prime Video series “The Rings of Power” — which could cost around a billion dollars by the time its planned five-season run ends — draws on some of those stray Tolkien tales as the inspiration for an epic saga set thousands of years before “The Hobbit,” at a time when the world’s different races formed wary alliances in an effort to thwart the dark power of Sauron. The show maintains the bright look and sense of wonder that made Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” movies so popular, though the large cast and varied settings also recall “Game of Thrones.”

‘Sidney’
Starts streaming: Sept. 23
The actor Sidney Poitier, who died earlier this year at 94, set a standard of excellence that placed him among the all-time greats. The documentary “Sidney” (directed by Reginald Hudlin for Oprah Winfrey’s production company Harpo) covers Poitier’s life from his childhood in the Bahamas through his rapid rise in the theater and then in Hollywood at a time when the opportunities for Black actors were slim. The film features an impressive slate of A-list actors and directors — plus one of the final interviews with the man himself — all explaining how Poitier’s influence as an artist and as a Civil Rights pioneer continues to endure.

‘Cars on the Road’
Starts streaming: Sept. 8
The “Cars” crew is among the most popular of Pixar’s creations, inspiring three feature films, a spinoff franchise (“Planes”) and countless toys, games and theme park attractions. The new series “Cars on the Road” sends the champion racer Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) and his tow-truck buddy Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) on a trip across the country, parceled out across nine short episodes that more or less add up to an hourlong “Cars” mini-movie. Unlike the grander big-screen adventures, these little eight-minute morsels are comic vignettes, set in a variety of locations and always rooted in the unlikely bond between these two mismatched pals.
‘Andor’ Season 1
Starts streaming: Sept. 21
The latest addition to the “Star Wars” TV universe is a prequel to a prequel, filling in the backstory of one of the major characters from the 2016 movie “Rogue One” — and, in the process, fleshing out more of the pre-“A New Hope” saga of the Rebel Alliance’s rise as a legitimate challenge to the dominance of the Galactic Empire. Diego Luna reprises his role as Cassian Andor, a cynical crook with a tragic past, who is persuaded to use his talents for deception and thievery to aid the Rebel cause. The 12-episode first season will be followed later by an already in-the-works 12-episode second season, which will take “Andor” all the way up to to the part of the “Star Wars” timeline where “Rogue One” begins.

Starts streaming: Sept. 16
For their unclassifiable “Los Espookys,” the creators Julio Torres, Ana Fabrega and Fred Armisen have brought a gently surreal comic sensibility to the weird adventures of a horror-loving theater troupe in a fictional Latin American country. Torres and Fabrega play two members of the troupe, Andrés and Tati, who alongside their visionary leader Renaldo (Bernardo Velasco) and their more pragmatic partner Úrsula (Cassandra Ciangherotti) hire themselves out to people looking for someone to provide realistic haunted house effects. Season 1 introduced this eccentric crew and featured subplots with Renaldo’s Uncle Tico (Armisen), a valet parking attendant who lives in Hollywood. It’s hard to predict what’s in store for Season 2, given that the first run featured such a unique mix of supernatural fantasy and low-key hangout comedy.

‘Reboot’ Season 1
Starts streaming: Sept. 20
This inside-Hollywood farce pokes fun at the modern phenomenon of streaming services and TV networks reviving classic shows. “Reboot” is about a neurotic writer (Rachel Bloom) who sells Hulu an edgy update of a long-cancelled family sitcom, but then discovers that the original showrunner (Paul Reiser) still has the rights to make new episodes. The show-within-the-show’s cast members — Keegan-Michael Key, Judy Greer and Johnny Knoxville — encourage the old guard and the new to work together to bring some heat back to their own flagging careers. The veteran TV writer Steven Levitan (“Modern Family”) created “Reboot,” drawing on his own years in the complicated business of making “comfort” comedies that are equal parts funny and true.
‘Ramy’ Season 3
Starts streaming: Sept. 28
In Season 2 of the comedian Ramy Youssef’s semi-autobiographical dramedy, his title character tried hard to straighten out his life by recommitting himself to his Muslim faith and even pursuing a traditional marriage. Then all of Ramy’s plans fell apart, leaving him with a choice at the end of the finale: to stay on the righteous path he had been on, or to backslide. The belated Season 3 will pick up that larger story, about one man’s attempts to balance his interest in religious traditions with the pleasures of a secular American life. “Ramy” will also continue to spend time with the character’s eclectic batch of friends and family members, who face traumas and hangups of their own.

Braugher plays the firm’s charismatic new partner, while Slattery plays Diane’s doctor, helping her adjust to whatever comes next. “The Good Fight” — a spinoff of the long-running legal drama “The Good Wife” — has been through multiple on-screen and behind-the-scenes upheavals since its 2017 debut, but what has remained consistent is the head writers Michelle and Robert King’s sharp-witted approach to ripped-from-the-headlines political stories, which playfully examine how the American justice system is trying to hold the line against the tumult of our crazy times.

E.S.G. is about profit, not politics, BlackRock argues.

Lucas Jackson/Reuters
What E.S.G. really means
BlackRock wants to clear the air on “woke” investing.
Yesterday, the world’s largest money manager published a letter pushing back on one it received last month from 19 Republican state attorneys general who accused BlackRock of putting its “climate agenda” ahead of clients, collaborating with climate activists and boycotting energy companies. Tensions between BlackRock and Texas in particular came to a head last month when the state accused BlackRock of boycotting energy companies, violating a 2021 law that aims to protect the energy industry from the growing popularity of climate-minded investing. As a result, BlackRock could be blackballed from managing the billions in retirement funds of Texas government employees.
BlackRock says it’s looking to correct “misconceptions” and “inaccurate statements” about its climate position. In its letter, BlackRock says that the firm has never dictated specific emission targets to any company, and that it doesn’t coordinate its investment decisions or shareholder votes with others on climate issues, as the attorneys general claimed. Far from boycotting, BlackRock says it has invested “hundreds of billions of dollars” in energy companies.
The firm is following a broad trend of policymakers and research when it comes to climate issues, BlackRock says. “Your letter makes several inaccurate statements about BlackRock’s motive for participating in various ESG-related initiatives,” BlackRock writes in the letter, which is signed by the firm’s head of external affairs, Dalia Blass. (E.S.G., or environmental, social and governance, is the latest term for socially conscious investing.) Instead, BlackRock says its shareholder votes and investment decisions reflect that, generally, its investment professionals believe that climate change poses real risks and opportunities for investors. The firm’s belief is “by no means unique,” BlackRock writes.
BlackRock’s tussle with state officials comes at a time when corporate social policies are becoming a campaign issue. Republican legislators in Texas and elsewhere have looked to punish companies that try to reduce the sales of guns, or help their employees gain access to abortions. At the urging of Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida, an oversight board voted to ban the consideration of “social, political or ideological interests” when making investment decisions about the state’s pension fund.

Yet fund managers in many red states appear to be backing E.S.G. measures anyway. A recent study from the fund research firm Morningstar found that pension funds in those states had an average support rate of 80 percent for shareholders’ proposals that encourage companies to consider environmental, social and governance issues as well as their bottom lines. For instance, this year, Texas’ Employees Retirement System, the state’s second-largest public pension fund, voted for shareholder proposals that urged big banks to cut off lending to fossil fuel companies.
“Do a lot of red states have the same problem that they point out is an issue among large E.S.G.-promoting asset managers in their own backyards?” Vivek Ramaswamy, the author of “Woke, Inc.”, asks DealBook. “The answer is yes.” He recently started his own fund firm, Strive, which promises to prioritize profit considerations in its investment decisions.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A top Fed official signals more rate hikes are coming. Lael Brainard, the central bank’s vice chair, said the Fed would need to see “several months” of low monthly inflation data before it was convinced that inflation was cooling off. That fortified expectations that the Fed will raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point this month.
President Biden reportedly delays a decision on China tariffs. The White House is holding back on scrapping Trump-era levies on Chinese imports, Bloomberg reports. While the administration is still considering ways to offer American businesses relief, political considerations are playing a role in the delay.

New research backs Twitter’s claim on bots.

That 5 percent figure has been questioned by both Elon Musk, who cites it as a reason to call off his Twitter takeover bid. Bob Iger, a former C.E.O. of Disney, said he had concluded that a “substantial portion” of Twitter’s users were fake when the entertainment giant weighed buying Twitter.

Europe’s energy reprieve looks tenuous
Natural gas prices in Europe have plummeted more than 40 percent over the past 10 days, welcome news for businesses, homeowners and policymakers from London to Berlin.

This morning, the futures contract for Dutch T.T.F. natural gas traded below 200 euros per megawatt hour, after soaring to a record of nearly 350 euros per megawatt hour last month as uncertainties over the flow of Russian gas to Europe jolted the markets.

Don’t bank on this benign price trend continuing. “A key reason behind the recent price volatility is that traders just don’t know what to make of this market,” Fabian Skarboe Ronningen, a senior analyst at Rystad Energy, told DealBook.
Traders are watching for whether the European Commission will intervene in the energy markets, in an effort to limit price rises. Until details emerge on what that would look like — E.U. ministers will hold a meeting on that tomorrow — trading could be subdued, he said.

Also allaying trader worries are Europe’s success in finding alternatives to Russian gas and rising gas storage rates on the continent. Germany is ahead of schedule in filling up its natural storage facilities to nearly 86 percent, according to Rystad. Italy is at 84 percent, and France is at 93.5 percent.
All that bodes well for the early winter months, but it doesn’t mean Europe is out of the woods. “Europe may not need to rely on Russia to get through this winter,” Ronningen said. “But in March, next year? If they are down to 10 to 20 percent storage levels, that will make things difficult to get through the spring.”

The next shock to supply chains
The world is still grappling with the turmoil that the coronavirus pandemic dealt to global supply chains, which snarled the production of huge sections of goods including automobiles and iPhones. But experts warn that delicate industrial networks are at risk from another major threat, The Times’s Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher report: climate change.
“What we just went through with Covid is a window to what climate could do,” said Kyle Meng, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Extreme weather events around the world are becoming more frequent, causing an array of knock-on effects, including component shortages and shipping delays.
Consider a record drought in southwestern China: It reduced the amount of available hydropower, leading to power cuts at regional factories, including those for Foxconn and Toyota. Vegetables in the area wilted from heat, driving up meat prices.
Finding solutions and alternatives isn’t easy. Building factories elsewhere could be costly for both companies and consumers. And competition for food production could lead to more export controls that reduce global agriculture flows, a fear that prompted the World Trade Organization to warn against countries imposing protectionist policies.

To many economists, trade can help solve climate-related problems — but also aggravate them. “We are so interconnected from our supply chains that events on one side of the world can dramatically impact people’s well-being elsewhere,” Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Times.
“There is a limit to the economics you can pay and have a business that can be profitable.”

Wall Street takes on TikTok
Wall Street firms have long believed in the need to portray and protect a strong and consistent image, and that aim generally extends to their social media policies. But those strict guidelines are running up against two forces: a tight labor market and a talent pool of potential recruits full of social media natives who want the ability to freely express themselves.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That’s caused the media-shy Wall Street firms to jump into creating their own social media content, rather than fight their junior associates’  propensity to post. Are they winning? Not yet.
BlackRock joined TikTok this year, and Goldman Sachs is reportedly planning to follow. Why TikTok? Because that’s where the potential hires are. BlackRock has about 15,000 followers on TikTok. Its videos tend to be more about financial education and less about giving a picture of what it’s like to work at the firm. The videos feature a young and diverse crowd. Jackie Nov, BlackRock’s global head of social media, told DealBook that BlackRock featured “employees from all over the firm” and that its engagement on TikTok was geared toward promoting “financial well-being.” That said, BlackRock has yet to produce a viral hit on TikTok.
But can Wall Street firms, known to prize privacy and secrecy, also do authentic? Jeffrey Younger, an associate professor of management communication at N.Y.U. Stern, isn’t so sure. “Effective business strategies require communication that becomes more predictive or proactive, looking to ultimately build interactive relationships with stakeholders,” he told DealBook, meaning, at some point, if done right, the brand becomes a part of consumers’ everyday life.
For now, the finance industry’s most junior employees are the ones who are winning on TikTok. Social media posts showing what it’s like to work as an entry-level analyst remain extremely popular. One TikTok user, Naeche Vincent, 24, shares her experience working 19-hour days and tips on how to make a good impression in the industry. Some of her videos get millions of likes.

2022-09-09,"NAIROBI, Kenya — Though Queen Elizabeth II was revered by many in Africa, her death also reignited a different sort of conversation — one that touched on the legacy of the British Empire and the brutality the monarchy meted out to people in its former colonies.
In a younger generation of Africans growing up in a post-colonial world, some lamented that the queen never faced up to the grim aftermath of colonialism and empire, or issued an official apology. They said they wanted to use the moment to recall the oppression and horrors their parents and grandparents endured in the name of the Crown, and to urge for the return of crown jewels — rare massive diamonds — taken from the continent.
“You can look at the monarchy from the point of view of high tea and nice outfits and charity,” said Alice Mugo, a 34-year-old lawyer in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. “But there’s also the ugly side, and for you to ignore the ugly side is dishonest.”
Ms. Mugo said she recently found her grandmother’s “movement pass,” issued when the British colonial government in Kenya declared a state of emergency to help suppress the anticolonial Mau Mau rebellion. The passes restricted the free movement of Kenyans.

It was while a young Elizabeth was on an official tour of Kenya, in 1952, that she learned of her father’s death and that she would become queen. The clampdown on Kenyans, which began just months after the queen ascended the throne, led to the establishment of a vast system of detention camps and the torture, rape, castration and killing of tens of thousands of people.

Those mourning the queen’s death, Ms. Mugo said, were not aware of how her government robbed millions of basic freedoms.

Catherine’s Public Appearance: The Princess of Wales appeared in public for the first time since her cancer diagnosis, as she took part in a parade to celebrate the birthday of King Charles III.
A New Portrait: Charles unveiled the first official painted portrait of himself — a striking oil painting by the artist Jonathan Yeo in which he stares head-on against a backdrop of mottled red, pink and fuchsia hues.
Officially a U.S. Resident: For years, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, have considered California home. Recently, he updated his residency in a corporate filing.
Similar sentiments were echoed by a South African political party, Economic Freedom Fighters, which said in a statement that it would not mourn the queen, “because to us her death is a reminder of a very tragic period in this country and Africa’s history.”
The queen, they wrote, was the “head of an institution built up, sustained and living off a brutal legacy of dehumanization of millions of people across the world.”

The debate over how Africans should view the queen went viral when Uju Anya, a Nigeria-born professor at Carnegie Mellon University, posted a tweet in which she wished the queen “excruciating” pain on her deathbed for overseeing a “thieving raping genocidal empire.” When criticism came — including from her own university and Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon — Ms. Anya doubled down.
“If anyone expects me to express anything but disdain for the monarch,” she wrote, “you can keep wishing upon a star.”
Her original tweet was removed by Twitter for violating the platform’s rules.
For some across the continent, the queen was an admirable figure who represented continuity and balance in a changing world. In Ghana, tributes for “Maa Lizzy” were shared on Twitter.
“I grew to admire her over the years, just watching how she carried herself, and her commitment to what she committed to at 25,” said Yemi Adamolekun, the executive director of Enough is Enough Nigeria, a network of organizations promoting good governance. “She just kept at it, and I think there’s a lot to be admired in that regard.”

African leaders mourned the queen’s passing and offered condolences to Britain and her family. The presidents of Kenya and Ghana also ordered that flags be flown at half-staff for several days, drawing pushback on social media.

Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria’s president, wrote on Twitter that “The story of modern Nigeria will never be complete without a chapter on Queen Elizabeth II, a towering global personality and an outstanding leader.”
William Ruto, Kenya’s president-elect, called the queen’s leadership of the Commonwealth “admirable.” The association, which was born out of the embers of the British Empire but has lost much of its earlier glory, has still attracted new members like Rwanda, Gabon and Togo, which have had no colonial connections to Britain.
For 27-year-old Naledi Mashishi, whose South African grandmother was forced to sing the God Save the Queen anthem each day at school, Queen Elizabeth will forever remain the face of the empire and its bitter legacy in Africa.
In the wake of the queen’s death, Ms. Mashishi joined a legion of young South Africans demanding the return of the diamonds that form part of the crown jewels. Cut from the Cullinan, which was discovered in South Africa in 1905 and considered the largest diamond ever found, the rare gemstones sit atop the Imperial State Crown and the Sovereign Scepter, which are both used during the coronation of the British monarch.

The stone was a gift from the Afrikaner government to King Edward VII after the South African War, also known as the Anglo-Boer War. But Black South Africans have questioned a minority government’s right to bestow as a gift a gem uncovered during a time of brutal exploitation of Black people. On her 21st birthday in 1947, the Queen made a speech from a still segregated Cape Town, pledging her service to the Commonwealth.

“I think there’s something very disingenuous about saying the queen or the current royal family have nothing to do with the past,” Ms. Mashishi said. “Meanwhile, they are still happily wearing these stolen jewels.”
But with the queen’s passing, observers say that tough conversations about the empire’s past actions in Africa will only continue to gain steam.
“It’s way more than the diamonds,” said Lebohang Pheko, a political economist and a senior researcher at the South African think tank, Trade Collective. “There are not going to be easy conversations around this anymore.”

“The past is with us all, whether we like it or not.” So says Arondir (Ismael Cruz Córdova), an elf soldier in Amazon Prime Video’s “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.”
He’s talking about the threat of evil in Middle-earth, which — like a good action hero — he correctly suspects is rising again. But he could just as well be describing current-day TV. “The Rings of Power,” a series that takes place thousands of years before the “Lord of the Rings” movies, is just the latest, priciest example of today’s prequel-mania. On TV, the past is everywhere.
HBO’s “House of the Dragon” recently took wing as a bloody story of royal succession set generations before “Game of Thrones.” August saw the finale of the “Breaking Bad” prequel, “Better Call Saul,” which will contend at the Emmys on Monday. “Fear the Walking Dead” explored the early days of a zombie apocalypse. “Star Wars” re-revisited its past in “Obi-Wan Kenobi.” The show creator Taylor Sheridan has followed his hit “Yellowstone” with “1883”; “1923” is next, and the calendar has plenty of years left.
Why is TV so aggressively turning back the clock? It’s hard to go broke giving people more of what they once liked, of course. And the content boom on streaming TV makes rehashing familiar franchises more attractive. When viewers are paralyzed by choice among hundreds of series, it’s easier to stand out with a brand people already know.

Past TV sequels and spinoffs generally moved forward in time: It was “AfterMASH,” not “BeforeMASH.” Prequels, on the other hand, often double back to continue stories that definitively ended, as many contemporary dramas do. The final cut to black of “The Sopranos” didn’t keep its creator, David Chase, from time-traveling to Satriale’s Pork Store in the movie “The Many Saints of Newark.”
Like any spinoff, a prequel can be a cash grab, but it doesn’t have to be creatively bankrupt. At best, returning to characters whose destinies we already know can allow a series to focus less on the what of the story and more on the why.
This was what made “Better Call Saul” (which time-jumped into sequel mode in its final episodes) a true original even as it followed one of TV’s greatest dramas. Knowing that Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) would become a sleazy drug lawyer made his minutely observed downfall no less fascinating, and the series balanced his story with the parallel moral arc of the new character Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn), as she grew entangled in his life and schemes.
“Saul” was less special, though, when it focused on fleshing out minor backstory points for “Breaking Bad” superfans. As the “Star Wars” movie prequels showed us, with their blather about “midi-chlorians” (the eensy-weensy life-forms linked to the Force), just because you can answer a question doesn’t mean you should.
As a critic and viewer, I like a well-executed prequel (and I hope Seehorn finally brings home an Emmy for “Saul”). But I’ll admit to getting exhausted with TV’s attempts to wring more life out of existing intellectual property. No prequel this year has thrilled me like the original, out-of-the-blue, not-based-on-a-previous-anything “Severance.”

Still, audiences keep turning up. And I wonder if the complication and uncertainty of life is a part of prequels’ appeal. The horizon is full of question marks — global, political and personal. We’re overwhelmed with choice and with the unknown. With a prequel, you know — at least in broad strokes — what’s coming.
That can be a kind of comfort. Maybe prequels satisfy the same urge we felt in our earliest days as audiences, asking for one more read from a well-worn book at bedtime: Tell me a story where I know how it turns out.

Loaded Baked Frittata
My go-to frittata consists of eggs and whatever odds and ends are languishing in the fridge. This catchall method works just fine. But, for something a little nicer, I recently whipped up Genevieve Ko’s loaded baked frittata with goat cheese, bacon, spinach and sweet peppers. Yes, a few minutes of sautéing made it slightly more involved than just throwing last night’s roasted eggplant into the pan. But it was also better. The combination of melty goat cheese and crisp bacon is a classic for a reason, and all the vegetables lightened the mix. It was wonderful hot from the oven, and the cold leftovers, stuffed into sandwiches with mayo and hot sauce, make for easy lunches as we move out of summer, and into September’s hectic clutches.

2022-09-11,"This review contains spoilers for the first two seasons of “War of the Worlds.”
As you make your way through the cavernous emporium that television has become, brand loyalty may be your best hedge against disappointment. It can be limiting, sure. But if you know you are likely to enjoy the latest Taylor Sheridan drama or Adult Swim animated comedy, that’s valuable time saved.
There is a logo that signals happiness for me, but it’s a little farther afield. Someone in Paris has my number: For the last decade or so, a handful of my very favorite shows have begun life on the French channel Canal+.
A lot of shows from Canal+ — an ad-free subscription service analogous to HBO — don’t make it to America, and I’m sure there are plenty that I wouldn’t care for. But its programmers have a taste for atmospheric, complicated genre pieces, and over the years there has been a succession of its series that I’ve eagerly consumed: the Paris police procedural “Spiral,” the eerie supernatural-metaphysical melodrama “The Returned,” the superlative spy thriller “The Bureau.” My fixation continues with “War of the Worlds,” a particularly dark and dystopian science-fiction adventure whose third season begins Monday on Epix. (Seasons of all four shows are available at Amazon Prime Video.)
“War of the Worlds” differs in being a French-English coproduction (with the Fox Networks Group) whose action, especially in recent episodes, mostly takes place in London, with English dialogue. It was created, and to this point has been written by, the British TV veteran Howard Overman, best known for creating the award-winning supernatural dramedy “Misfits.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Overman’s story has points of connection with the H.G. Wells novel he very loosely adapts: Invaders (who turn out to be physically compromised) arrive in gigantic ships and assert their dominance, while human refugees do a lot of fleeing and hunkering down. There are fewer of these refugees than Wells imagined, however. In the show’s first episode, the spacecraft that land emit a signal that kills nearly everyone on Earth, sparing only those who are underground or otherwise shielded.
The first two seasons followed increasingly smaller bands of survivors in France and England who eventually coalesced in London around Bill Ward (Gabriel Byrne), a scientist whose existence the invaders were somehow aware of. The feel was clammy and claustrophobic — there was no word from the rest of the world — with a steady drip-drip-drip of horror as the humans were picked off by the mechanical attack dogs the invaders deployed. The whirring, clanking noises the robots made were an eerie signature.
But the show isn’t just a video-game-style thriller. Overman does a good job with the human relationships, which are marked by the anger, despair and pettiness the dire situation gives rise to. Characters backbite, bellyache, reluctantly pitch in and commit mundane acts of heroism in a largely believable manner, and there’s blessedly little inspirational speechmaking.
The show is also a big-idea science fiction fantasy, of course, and that is both a strength and a weakness. The delayed revelation of who and what the invaders were, and how they connected with the show’s human characters, was intriguing — which was the minimum requirement for plugging you into the show — but the science involved felt a little more fictional than usual. And there are some fundamental questions about the plot that are still unclear, and which you suspect may remain so.

If you’ve watched the first two seasons — here come the big spoilers — you know that the invaders are actually humans who have apparently traveled back in time on a mission of self-preservation, and that Bill stands in their way. And you know that the second season ended with Bill using the invaders’ technology to time travel himself, arriving before the invasion and committing a murder that would prevent the invaders from ever existing.

So Season 3 is one of those sci-fi reboots in which things never happened and the world is back to normal, except that Bill is in prison, there’s a black hole hovering over Earth (there’s that dodgy science again) and people are having visions that look a lot like memories of the invasion that didn’t happen.
The visions, presumably being experienced by people who, in the original timeline, were survivors, are a smart device for keeping the cast together — characters like the resourceful cop Zoe (Pearl Chanda), the compassionate immigrant Kariem (Bayo Gbadamosi) and the awkward French scientist Catherine (Léa Drucker), who will eventually recognize one another, and Bill. And they still have a battle to fight, since a few of the invaders, including the implacable Adina (Ania Sowinski), stowed away with Bill in the time machine and are working on building a new one.
The mood and story lines in the new season are more like those of a conventional mystery — there are police chases now — with the dramatic spice of a handful of characters knowing an earthshaking secret that they can’t talk about without being considered crazy.
It’s a great situation for Byrne, whose grumpy, weary performance as Bill drives the show. With a prison sentence as his reward for saving the world, Bill is now more completely fed up than ever, and his reaction when Zoe tells him he needs to do it again is succinct and profane. Byrne, in a way that feels more French than British, makes you understand exactly how big a bother this world-saving business is."
2022-09-12,"More than six months after one of the largest infant formula manufacturing plants in the United States issued a recall and was then shut down because of contamination concerns, a newborn staple remains in short supply.
In parts of the country, parents and their families are scrambling to find precious containers of formula for their babies, and many large retailers remain out of stock of popular brands. Some companies like Walmart and Target are limiting the number of containers that can be purchased at one time.
While the situation has improved since mid-July, the out-of-stock figure for powdered formula on store shelves in late August remained at 23 percent, still above the 10 percent it was before the recall and shutdown, according to the market research firm IRI.
“It all depends on geography and the retailer,” said Brian Dittmeier, the senior director of public policy at the National WIC Association, a nonprofit organization. The WIC program provides nutritional assistance for women, infants and children, and accounts for about half the formula use in the country. “There are some locations,” Mr. Dittmeier said, “where the supply of infant formula is healthy and others where it is not.”

But even as the scarcity subsides, parents and caregivers say the federal Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the formula industry, is not doing enough to address systemic problems exposed by the February shutdown of the Abbott Nutrition factory in Sturgis, Mich., that set off the nationwide shortages.
The shutdown occurred after reports of infections in four babies — two of them fatal — who had consumed formula manufactured at the plant. On Feb. 17, two days after the shutdown, Abbott recalled batches of three powdered formulas over complaints of serious bacterial contamination. (Abbott has said there is no “conclusive evidence” to link the company’s formulas to the illnesses.) That disruption made it clear just how dependent Americans were on a few formula manufacturers, and the Biden administration found itself scrambling to figure out how to make more product available.

The F.D.A. said it was now receiving weekly updates from domestic manufacturers and had arranged for nearly 18.9 million cans of formula to be brought in from abroad. “Is there enough formula to go around? The answer is yes, there already is enough formula here,” said Dr. Robert M. Califf, the commissioner of the F.D.A. “We just have to continue to work to get the distribution improved.” He noted, however, that it would take another couple of months before consumers saw the broad array of formulas on store shelves that were available at the beginning of the year.
While the two other domestic manufacturers, Reckitt Benckiser, which makes the popular Enfamil brand of formula, and Perrigo, which manufactures generic formula for retailers, ramped up production, the F.D.A. also relaxed some of the restrictions on imports. The result was an avalanche of applications from manufacturers all over the world.

The U.S. market, estimated at $2 billion to $4 billion annually, has been notoriously tough for foreign formula companies to crack, owing to regulatory hurdles and tariffs.
While the foreign formula is supposed to be allowed into the United States only on a temporary basis, ending around Nov. 14, the F.D.A. said it would release guidance this month on how the new companies could continue to sell in the United States past this fall.
“Parents in the U.S. have been looking for a better product than what they were being offered,” said Will McMahon, one of the members of the family that owns the British baby formula Kendamil. The company has spent the last three years working through the formal process, including clinical trials, necessary to get its organic infant formula approved by the F.D.A.
Kendamil was one of the earliest formulas to have their application approved by the F.D.A. in the wake of the Sturgis plant shutdown, and the company has begun sending two million cans of formula to the United States.

But some parents say relying on foreign manufacturers is not a long-term solution. “It boggles my mind that the supply chain was so fragile and could be broken in such a major way,” said Christine Robinson, whose 8-month-old son is fed with formula.

Ms. Robinson said she worried that relying on non-U.S. brands could lead to issues for babies whose sensitive digestive systems do not adapt easily to change once the U.S. suppliers are able to ramp up production and the foreign formulas are phased out.
Ms. Robinson, who lives in Bucks County, Pa., said she would prefer that the F.D.A. streamline approvals for new American-made formula brands to diversify the market.
The F.D.A. has allowed more than a dozen non-U.S. companies to ship more than 18 million cans of formula into the United States, a mix of established manufacturers like Danone and Nestlé in Europe but also smaller, lesser-known companies like Global Kosher, based in Britain, and Care A2+, an Australian company that started operations in October 2020.
But other larger global manufacturers that had formula available to ship were left on the sidelines. Some, like Organic-Family, a unit of the Swiss company Holle, said it had not gotten an update from the F.D.A. on its application. Thorben Nilewski, a managing director at Organic-Family, said in an email, “It feels like our offer or opinion isn’t really of interest at this point.” And the stock of the Australian manufacturer A2 Milk dropped in early August after it said the F.D.A. had notified it that it was “deferring further consideration” of its application to import formula into the United States.

In an emailed statement, the F.D.A. said the letters sent to firms did not mean that their formulas were unsafe, but rather that there were issues that would probably not be quickly resolved.
“There are a variety of reasons why certain infant formulas may not have been moved forward,” Susan Mayne, director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the F.D.A., said in an interview. “The key criteria for us was whether the manufacturer had formula available immediately, as our goals were to get formula on the shelves as rapidly as possible.”
Priority was also given to applications from manufacturers that could provide medical and specialty formulas, she added. She said the agency was still reviewing applications.
In late August, Abbott said it was set to resume manufacturing Similac formulas at its plant in Sturgis.

The company also said that it had increased production at other U.S. factories and one in Ireland, and that it would supply the United States with more than eight million pounds of formula in August, an increase from the year before. But it noted that it would take six weeks for the Similac product from the Sturgis plant to start to hit store shelves.
But some industry experts say it will take time for Abbott to gain back the market share it once had. “To be frank, there is a lot of consumer mistrust around Similac right now,” said Mr. Dittmeier of the W.I.C. program.
That could be a boon for Reckitt Benckiser, which has been running its formula factories at full tilt all summer, hoping to hold on to the market share it has gained at Abbott’s expense. Its market share has climbed to nearly 60 percent from 35 percent before the recall, said Robert Cleveland, who oversees the Mead Johnson nutrition business at Reckitt.
“We remain committed to making as much formula as we can,” Mr. Cleveland said. “We continue to maximize our domestic manufacturing, running overtime and going 24/7.” He added that the company had received approval to bring in formula from its plants in Singapore and specialty formula from its facilities in Mexico.
Still, in late August, when Lori Sharp, a first-time mother in Port Hueneme, Calif., realized she was down to one container of Reckitt’s Enfamil Sensitive infant formula for her 3-month-old daughter, the formula was out of stock on Walmart.com.

Panicking, she scoured more websites and widened her geographic search. She eventually discovered a container of formula at a Target 40 minutes away in Moorpark, Calif. “I went into the store and they actually had four more, but their shelves were so bare,” Ms. Sharp said. “I bought all of them.”
In Georgia, some of the most acute shortages are in rural areas. Jennifer Kelly, who is the family services manager at the early Head Start program in Swainsboro, which is between Macon and Savannah, said trying to find formula earlier this summer had become a “daily chore.”

The 14 babies she watches drink seven different kinds of formula. She and her staff were often driving to Walmart, Walgreens or a local grocery chain or scouring Amazon for some of the more obscure brands.
“It’s not like it was a few months ago when the shelves were bare,” Ms. Kelly said. “I am hoping we are on the other side of this dilemma.”

When the formula shortage was at a crisis point in May, Ms. Robinson of Bucks County created a Facebook group that connected parents around the country. The group, called Formula Hunters, does not exchange money to keep out profiteers who have been hoarding formula and seeking to resell it at a markup.
The group operates on the notion that a parent who buys a hard-to-find formula brand and sends it to another parent in the group will eventually be repaid when others do the same for him or her.
Formula Hunters now has 1,500 members, who are still actively helping one another find formula. “This has been going on for so many months,” Ms. Robinson said. “The frustration has been high.”"

2022-09-14,"California’s attorney general filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon on Wednesday, claiming the retailer stifles competition and increases the prices that consumers pay across the internet.
The suit is limited to California, where officials said Amazon had around 25 million customers, but if it succeeds it could have a broad impact across the country.
“If you think about Californians paying even just a little bit more for every product they purchased online over the course of a year, let alone a decade, which is what is at issue here, the collective magnitude of harm here is very far-reaching,” said Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, during a news conference announcing the case.
“The ‘everything store’ has effectively set a price floor, costing Californians more for just about everything,” he said.

The lawsuit largely focuses on the way Amazon penalizes sellers for listing products at lower prices on other websites. If Amazon spots a product listed cheaper on a competitor’s website, it often will remove important buttons like “Buy Now” and “Add to Cart” from a product listing page.
Those buttons are a major driver of sales for companies selling through Amazon, and losing them can quickly hurt their businesses.
That creates a dilemma for marketplace sellers. At times, they can offer products for lower prices on sites other than Amazon because the cost of using those sites can be lower. But because Amazon is by far the largest online retailer, the sellers would rather raise their prices on other sites than risk losing their sales on Amazon, the complaint said, citing interviews with sellers, competitors and industry consultants.
“Without basic price competition, without different online sites trying to outdo each other with lower prices, prices artificially stabilize at levels higher than would be the case in a competitive market,” the complaint said.
The California suit is the latest in a string of increasingly aggressive efforts by states and regulators in Washington and Europe to curb the influence of the technology industry’s biggest companies. Also on Wednesday, a European Union court gave its blessing to a record multibillion-dollar fine issued against Google in 2018.

Given the size of California’s economy and Amazon’s role in it, “this is a piece of litigation that has significant national implications,” said Christopher R. Leslie, a professor of antitrust law at University of California, Irvine. If the antitrust claims prevail, “there is no way other states won’t pick up the mantle and bring other cases,” he said.
The lawsuit echoes a case that was brought by Karl A. Racine, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, and that was thrown out this spring. Judge Hiram E. Puig-Lugo of Superior Court of the District of Columbia found that Mr. Racine had not provided sufficient evidence that Amazon’s policies were anticompetitive. Mr. Racine is appealing the ruling.
“Similar to the D.C. attorney general — whose complaint was dismissed by the courts — the California attorney general has it exactly backwards,” Alex Haurek, an Amazon spokesman, said in a statement. “Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store.”
Amazon hopes the suit will be dismissed, Mr. Haurek said, and it takes pride in offering low prices “across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.”
Most of Amazon’s sales — 57 percent of units last quarter — are products that third-party merchants offer on its website. They pay Amazon a referral fee to list their products, and often pay for Amazon’s fulfillment services, advertising and other offerings. Amazon collected more than $100 billion in third-party service fees in the last 12 months, according to its financial filings.

California has been investigating Amazon for more than two years, and the complaint, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, said the practices violated California’s Unfair Competition Law and the Cartwright Act, the state’s primary antitrust law. It asked for remedies that included ending the anticompetitive behavior and paying penalties.
Mr. Haurek said the relief sought in the case “would force Amazon to feature higher prices to customers, oddly going against core objectives of antitrust law.”
Mr. Bonta said he thought the case would succeed where the District of Columbia had stumbled by providing far more details on how Amazon was hurting consumers. He said there was more research “than any other case has ever seen,” adding that California state law provides some additional protections.
The complaint said Amazon was able to charge sellers more than competitors because it captured so much of online sales. The rising costs for sellers include fulfillment and paying for advertising, which sellers increasingly see as a necessity to succeed. The complaint heavily cites internal Amazon documents that are redacted.
The result is an “anticompetitive cycle,” the complaint said, where sellers must raise prices on Amazon to recoup their costs. But because of Amazon’s pricing provisions, sellers must have higher prices on other sites, and “other online stores cannot effectively attract consumers away from Amazon with lower prices.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Bonta’s complaint quoted emails between a personal care electronics brand and another retailer, asking the retailer to raise prices on a discounted item because Amazon suppressed their listing. The brand wanted “to remove all deals and inventory until Q1 since this has happened several times and is causing a big disruption to the Amazon business,” it wrote. “We simply cannot afford buy-box shutdowns on Amazon anymore.”
The complaint said the seller no was longer supplying products to the competitor.
Mr. Leslie, the law professor, said the “meaty” complaint made a compelling argument, likely strengthened by the redacted evidence, that “if the market were left to run without the anticompetitive policies at Amazon, consumers could take advantage of lower prices outside of Amazon.” He said the case still faced hurdles, given the novel issues it raised.
Nationally, the Federal Trade Commission, led by Lina Khan, a critic of Amazon, is investigating whether Amazon has broken antitrust laws. The agency is also looking into the process through which consumers buy or cancel an Amazon Prime membership, which some say can be deliberately confusing.
Amazon has attacked the F.T.C. several times during the investigations. It said last year that Ms. Khan, who wrote a breakout law review critique of the company’s power, should recuse herself from antitrust inquiries into the company.
Last month, Amazon moved to stop the agency’s requests to interview Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, and its chief executive, Andy Jassy, in the Prime inquiry on the grounds that the requests were “calculated to serve no other purpose than to harass Amazon’s highest-ranking executives and disrupt its business operations.”

Lawmakers in Washington also have Amazon in their sights. The company has aggressively fought a bipartisan antitrust bill that would stop Amazon from favoring its own products in its online store. The proposal’s chances of passing may dim further as lawmakers turn their attention to the midterm elections.
Amazon has been more diplomatic in other cases. Facing an inquiry into its retail practices in Europe, the company proposed a series of changes, including limiting the data it collects from rival sellers and allowing them to sell to Prime customers without using Amazon’s logistics program."
2022-09-15,"On a cruise to celebrate their retirement after 40-year-long careers, four professional assassins learn that they have been placed on their employer’s “to-kill” list and are facing imminent annihilation. (Way to spoil the holiday!) Deploying their skill at death-avoiding improvisation, they activate the ship’s fire alarms and slip away undetected.
Their ages and gender are a help. “That’s the thing about being a 60-year-old woman — no one notices you unless you want them to,” observes the narrator, Billie.
Deanna Raybourn’s KILLERS OF A CERTAIN AGE (Berkley, 351 pp., $27), a kind of mash-up of “Killing Eve” and “The Golden Girls,” at times reads like a movie screenplay, as the women move (gingerly, due to their wonky knees) from one set piece to the next — injecting one victim with poison, stabbing another with a knitting needle, slathering a third with deadly, nicotine-laced mud while masquerading as masseuses. Sometimes Raybourn lays it on a bit thick with the hot flashes, doses of osteoporosis medicine and feisty-broad banter. “Five seconds wasn’t much time to disarm him, especially at our age,” Billie notes.
Amid all the wisecracking, it’s a relief to go back in time, to chapters describing the women’s recruitment many years earlier by a shadowy government organization known as the Museum. Once dedicated to eliminating stray Nazis, the group has expanded its repertoire to include arms dealers, sex traffickers, cult leaders and corrupt judges, but it is facing a crisis of leadership. The women look to be casualties of a vicious internal struggle.
It’s good mindless fun to see how efficiently they assassinate their way out of trouble — picking lots, constructing weapons from household objects and throwing on impromptu disguises with just the sort of practical approach that characterizes the best spies. “I gathered the cards and tapped them twice before putting them in a stack on the left-hand side of the table,” Billie, disguised as a New Orleans fortune teller, relates. “That was the signal to Helen to take him out.”

Members of Congress have access to information that ordinary Americans don’t. They meet with chief executives, read classified intelligence reports and help set the rules by which the economy works.
That level of knowledge can give them an advantage if they or their families want to invest in the stock market — and many of them do: Nearly one in five members of Congress, from both parties, have in recent years bought stocks that intersected with their congressional committee work, a Times investigation found. And that’s probably an underestimate because lawmakers’ work extends beyond their committee duties, my colleague Kate Kelly, who reported on the story, told me.
Among the conflicts uncovered:
The wife of Representative Alan Lowenthal, a California Democrat, sold Boeing shares a day before a House committee that he sits on released a report exposing the company’s mishandling of its 737 Max jet, which had been involved in two deadly crashes.
Representative John Rose, a Republican of Tennessee, sold $100,000 to $250,000 in Wells Fargo stock a few months before a committee he is on released a report that was critical of the bank.
Senator Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican on the Armed Services Committee, and his wife sold options tied to Microsoft less than two weeks before the company lost a $10 billion contract with the Defense Department.

In many of these cases, little or no evidence directly links congressional work to a purchase or a sale. Most lawmakers questioned about potential conflicts of interest say that they followed the law or that a relative or broker with no knowledge of their congressional work made a purchase or sale.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But that demonstrates the problem: Lawmakers can profit from their inside knowledge while remaining within the bounds of the law but creating, at a minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Widespread distrust
The trades exacerbate many voters’ sense that politicians put their own interests above the public’s or the country’s. That, in turn, helps fuel Americans’ distrust of their government. Congress in particular consistently scores poorly in surveys about confidence in institutions.
Each of the past three presidents promised to restore that trust, in his own way. Barack Obama campaigned on his anticorruption record and later signed a law trying to stop congressional insider trading. Donald Trump vowed to “drain the swamp” of corruption and self-dealing (though his administration was plagued by ethics scandals). President Biden has called on Congress to prove that “democracy still works” and that government “can deliver for our people.”
The institutional distrust can pose a threat to democracy, scholars warn. If Americans don’t believe the government is working for them, they may be more likely to support alternatives, even nondemocratic options. In other countries, authoritarians have tapped into public distrust to justify more extreme measures and changes, eroding democracy around the world.

Potential solutions
Lawmakers have proposed bills to restrict their own stock trading. Some proposals would bar members of Congress and their spouses from buying stocks, a measure that majorities of voters support. Other legislation would force lawmakers and their spouses to put their investments into blind trusts.

On Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised a House vote on a congressional stock-trading bill this month. But neither that bill nor any other appears to have the bipartisan support needed to pass the Senate.
Why? For one, congressional stock trading can be a genuinely tricky issue. Some proposals would effectively force spouses to abandon yearslong careers that preceded a lawmaker’s time in Congress. That would be the case with, for example, Pelosi and Senator Tina Smith, whose husbands are professional investors.
It’s also unclear where to draw the line. Should lawmakers’ children, for example, be barred from buying stocks? (Some members of Congress think so: Representative Angie Craig said her college-age son had bought stocks without her knowledge. She told The Times that she disapproved of her son’s purchases and wanted to pass a law “to force him to listen to his mother.”)
And despite the optics, members of Congress may not be profiting much. Lawmakers’ stock purchases and sales from 2012 to 2020 did not perform better than other, similar stocks, a recent study found.

Still, there may be a simpler explanation for why lawmakers haven’t passed a bill, Kate said: “It’s not in their personal interest.”

A tragic debut
Perhat Tursun’s “The Backstreets” was released this week, the first Uyghur novel to be published in English. The book tells the tale of a man descending into madness in an oppressive environment. The real-life story of its creation is similarly harrowing, Tiffany May writes in The Times.
Soon after the English translation was finished, China escalated its repression of Uyghur people — including the detention of intellectuals — and Darren Byler, its translator, held off on releasing it. Still, Tursun and Byler’s Uyghur co-translator had disappeared into camps by 2018. After learning that Tursun had received a 16-year sentence, Byler decided to publish the book.
“They deserve to have their voices and their work recognized,” he said.

2022-09-18,"Citing losses, the supermarket chain Wegmans announced that it had halted the use of its self-checkout app in which customers scanned their groceries as they shopped.
The company did not specify the amount of losses or indicate whether they were from thefts or from customers who forgot to scan certain items, but it said in a statement that it was discontinuing the app’s use until it could make improvements “that will meet the needs of our customers and business.”
The app, known as SCAN, was introduced early in the pandemic to provide a contactless option for grocery shopping, the company said. Customers could scan each grocery item they picked up as they moved through a store. To pay, they would scan a bar code at the self-checkout register, which would pull the total from the app.
“SCAN users have told us they love the app and convenience it offers,” Wegmans said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the losses we are experiencing prevent us from continuing to make it available in its current state.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Wegmans, popular in the northeastern United States, said it would introduce new digital ways to streamline shopping. It was unclear where the app was available and what the company’s losses amounted to; a company representative could not be reached for further comment. Wegmans has 107 stores, with 48 in New York and the rest in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts and North Carolina.
Wegmans sent an email to frequent users of the app to offer them a $20 coupon for the inconvenience. A number of shoppers shared their disappointment about the app going out of service, saying on Twitter that it made their grocery trips more efficient.
At grocery stores, there are three main options for self-checkout systems.
One is an app, like the one Wegmans used, in which shoppers scan items as they go through a store. There are also self-checkout lanes, near the traditional registers that are staffed by store workers, in which shoppers scan and bag their purchases. An employee usually stands near these lanes to help with any complications.
A third was spearheaded by Amazon at its brick-and-mortar Amazon Go stores: Shoppers put items into their carts, and their accounts are automatically charged upon leaving without having to stop at a register. This approach relies on technology such as sensors and cameras that detect when an item is removed from a shelf and placed into a customer’s cart.
Self-checkout systems were developed to help speed up grocery shopping, said Ray Wimer, a professor of retail management at Syracuse University. He said he had noticed the systems improve in efficiency over the past two decades.

A study of retailers in the United States and Europe released in 2016 found that retailers with self-service lanes and apps had a loss rate of about 4 percent, which is more than double the industry average.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Walmart suspended the use of its Scan & Go app in 2018, four months after introducing it to more than 100 stores. The app had low participation, the company said. A former Walmart executive, Joel Larson, told Business Insider that the app was also phased out in part because of theft.
“Retailers in particular are very sensitive to loss prevention issues because the margins in their business are tighter, especially the grocery store retailers,” Mr. Wimer said.
The self-checkout lanes with an employee monitoring customers are more likely to remain in stores, he said. But he did not believe a cashier could ever be fully replaced, which was a concern when this system started. Self-checkout options still run into issues with scales and sensors that can hold up a line, and some customers prefer to avoid the possibility of that delay.
The Amazon-style system, which seems to prevent much of the loss present with other self-checkout apps, is expensive for companies to set up because of the technology required, Mr. Wimer said.

Responses to self-checkout options vary based on age, said Judy Mottl, the editor of Retail Customer Experience, a website with news about commerce, technology and consumer behavior. Younger people may be more inclined to use self-checkout options, but some customers are concerned about security and privacy as it is unknown how much data is stored with options like apps.
More companies experimented with self-checkout options at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData Retail, a company that provides insights on the retail market. Shoppers desired minimal contact for safety, and avoiding in-person interaction at the register provided that. The pandemic also prompted an increase in online shopping for groceries.
The shrinkage rate, or amount of theft, typically rises in retail stores when the cost of living increases, Mr. Saunders said. Inflation accelerated in 2021 partly because of soaring demand combined with supply chain disruptions. It was exacerbated in 2022 as the war in Ukraine caused fuel and food prices to surge.
“It’s a shame for customers because it deteriorates what is a very fast and efficient service,” Mr. Saunders said. “But as far as Wegmans is concerned, I think they have one eye at the bottom line, and they’re finding that the losses from this system are just too great.”"

2022-09-20,"YOU’VE BEEN PLAYED: How Corporations, Governments, and Schools Use Games to Control Us All, by Adrian Hon
When did daily life come to feel so much like a competition? In “You’ve Been Played,” Adrian Hon traces how and why gamification — the application of video-game principles like experience points, streaks, leader boards, badges and special challenges — has come to suffuse nearly every aspect of human existence in the digital era. Examples range from exercise (Nike, Strava), housework (Chore Wars) and brushing your teeth (Pokémon Smile), to — more disturbingly — going to school (ClassDojo) or work (Amazon warehouses’ PicksInSpace).
Hon slips easily between the perspectives of expert, enthusiast and critic. An education in neuroscience informs his explanation of the behaviorist underpinnings of gamification. And in his capacity leading the games company behind the popular running app Zombies, Run!, much of his working life is spent tussling with these issues. Some of the book’s most insightful moments come when Hon discusses how his team considers ethics and user experience when deciding how much to use gamification tricks in their own work.
Hon is also an unabashed fan of video games who admits to spending hundreds of hours compulsively playing titles that run the gamut of gamer respectability, from Civilization to Candy Crush. He clearly remains a believer in the promise of games and their principles, when used right, to delight people and even improve their lives.
The breadth of sources Hon marshals is evidence, too, of his grounding in the subject. Some are to be expected: books released by M.I.T. Press, work by well-known commentators like Neil Postman and Ian Bogost, news articles from mainstream and gaming publications, plus a handful of loftier references like Aristotle’s “Nicomachean Ethics” and Foucault’s “Discipline and Punish.” But throughout, the book also quotes liberally from ordinary users’ posts on social networks and internet forums. This firsthand testimony — an outsourced Amazon driver’s complaint that the company’s ranking-and-scoring app is inaccurate and disincentivizes safe driving, for instance — is often illuminating and persuasive.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That Hon is neither Luddite nor scold lends his criticisms of gamification bite and authority. “You’ve Been Played” is at its sharpest when Hon dresses down lazy or coercive gamification. He builds a case that the deliberate layering of generic points, leader boards, missions and the like atop any kind of human behavior is at best useless and at worst insidious.
Even more convincing, and fascinating, is his examination of how employers and schools use gamification strategies to justify and facilitate near-constant surveillance of workers and students, opening them up to punishment for deviations from perfect behavior even when the boss or teacher isn’t looking. Hon makes a strong and sophisticated argument that workplace gamification is in fact “doubly coercive,” since workers are less able to opt out of the experience that is pushing them into choices they wouldn’t otherwise make, potentially even dangerous ones like driving longer hours to achieve a “reward” from Uber.
Less cogent are digressions into some au courant topics for digital hand-wringing, like conspiracy theories and crowdsourcing criminal investigations, whose relevance here is less obvious. Hon draws out at length an analogy between QAnon and alternate reality games, both of which scratch adherents’ itch to fall down rabbit holes, uncover secrets and trace connections. But this is proof that our larger society reflects game mechanics, not necessarily that it’s being villainously driven by them. QAnon, infamously sprawling and atomized, lacks an individual malevolent actor or even central force to hold to account, so the comparison leaves the reader wanting.

Item 1 of 8
This tension between incisive, specific ideas about technology design and mushier ones about society persists into the conclusion, where Hon lays out some possible solutions to the problems gamification has wrought. Alongside excellent advice for designers hoping to use these techniques ethically are some pretty unsatisfying prescriptions for how the gamification of real life might be averted. Ending the nefarious reign of workplace gamification, Hon writes, will require empowering workers via “some combination of exerting existing antitrust laws, increasing minimum wages, improving the social safety net, strengthening unions and introducing strict workplace regulation.” (Oh, is that all?) It’s hard to feel there’s any way to win if the final boss to be defeated is capitalism itself.

2022-09-21,"Twitch is the most popular game streaming service on the internet, but it may face challenges in trying to keep the most popular streamers.
On Wednesday, the company said it would reduce the subscription revenue it shared with some of the biggest streamers on its service, shrinking their cut to 50 percent from 70 percent in certain situations.
Twitch, which has lost several popular streamers to exclusive deals with YouTube, previously lifted its own exclusivity agreement that prevented big-revenue streamers from streaming on rival services.
Eight years after Amazon acquired it, the company is still struggling to find the right balance between the enormous cost of streaming video across the internet and the importance of the big personalities who bring the most eyeballs — and the most revenue — to the service. Well-known creators are the main attraction on Twitch, much like movie stars.

“I know they have to make money somewhere, but this just seems like a bad business decision,” said Kaitlyn Siragusa, a Twitch streamer known as Amouranth, who has almost six million followers and almost 15,000 subscribers and is likely to be affected by the change. “They are just making the platform less appealing to streamers.”
A Twitch spokeswoman said executives were unable to discuss the situation for this article.
As it rolls out this new revenue-sharing plan, the company also faces questions about gambling on its service, including protests by some streamers against channels that promote gambling. The company announced on Tuesday that it would prohibit the streaming of gambling sites that involved slots, roulette or dice games that were not licensed in the United States and certain other territories.
From April through June, people watched 5.64 billion hours of streams on Twitch across 9.6 million distinct channels on the service, according to data from StreamLabs, a streaming software company. YouTube Gaming, the internet’s second-most-popular service, topped out at 1.13 billion hours.

But YouTube, owned by Google, is pushing for a larger viewership. Over the past year, it has signed three popular Twitch streamers to exclusive contracts.
ADVERTISEMENT

A month after two of them left, Twitch announced that it was lifting its exclusivity ban. Now the company is reducing what it calls premium deals — agreements that give popular streamers a larger cut of subscription revenue than others on the service.
These premium partners now receive a 70 percent cut. In a blog post on Wednesday, Twitch’s president, Dan Clancy, said that they would still receive this cut on the first $100,000 earned over a 12-month period but then 50 percent after that.
All other streamers on the platform receive a 50 percent cut. More than a year ago, Twitch decided to stop offering premium deals, and it is working to bring the existing ones in line with the rest of the service.
“We don’t believe it’s right for those on standard contracts to have varied revenue shares based on the size of the streamer,” Mr. Clancy said in the blog post. “In an ideal world all streamers would be on the same set of terms regardless of size.”
The change won’t take effect until June 1, and those on premium deals won’t see their cut change until their contracts come up for renewal.

Twitch said it had made the change at least partly because of the high cost of streaming video through its cloud service provider: its parent company, Amazon.
Ms. Siragusa, the popular Twitch streamer, said that she had already discussed the possibilities of streaming with other companies and that Twitch’s new revenue-sharing terms may push her even closer to a move.
These new changes “might just push all of us over the edge,” she said in a phone interview. “Why not actively pursue deals with other companies?”
In his blog post, Mr. Clancy, the Twitch president, said popular streamers could recoup any lost revenue through the company’s advertising service, pointing out that a new program provides streamers with a 55 percent cut of advertising revenue brought in by their channels. But Ms. Siragusa said this was significantly less attractive than pulling in money through subscriptions.
“Ads just make your audience mad,” she said. “For Twitch, it may be more profitable. But for us? It is not ideal.”"
2022-09-22,"Two New Jersey-based companies have agreed to pay a total of $325,000 in fines for selling a pesticide that federal officials say was falsely marketed as a disinfectant spray that could help eliminate the coronavirus, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The product, Zoono Microbe Shield, from Zoono USA and Zoono Holdings, was sold online through Amazon and other websites and to community centers and was even purchased by United Airlines during the height of the pandemic to disinfect cabins, the E.P.A. said Wednesday in a statement announcing the settlement.
The E.P.A. said that while reviewing Zoono Microbe Shield’s label, the agency discovered that it was sold with claims about public health that “substantially differed” from what was registered with the agency, which is illegal, and that the claims were “false” and “misleading.”
The move to fine the companies followed a warning from the E.P.A. in 2020 that said retailers selling disinfectants and sanitizers that wrongly claimed protection against the coronavirus would face legal action.
“With settlements like these, E.P.A. is making sure that consumers can safely rely on the claims made for pesticides registered by the E.P.A., while also encouraging regulated entities to come into compliance with critical environmental laws that protect public health,” Lisa F. Garcia, a regional administrator with the E.P.A., said in the statement.
Zoono USA was fined $205,000 and Zoono Holdings $120,000. They share an address in Shrewsbury, N.J., and are subsidiaries of a under New Zealand company, Zoono Group Ltd.
Wayne Herriott, a spokesman for Zoono Holdings, said Thursday that the company bought the distribution rights for Zoono products in the United States in late 2021 from Zoono USA and that the company was “unaware at that time of any misleading claims being made by the distributor or sub distributors.”
“Zoono Holdings takes regulatory responsibilities very seriously and as soon as Zoono Holdings received notification from the E.P.A. that in market advertising claims were under investigation, Zoono Holdings halted all in market sales and worked diligently to remove any misleading claims from the market,” Mr. Herriott said in an email. “Zoono Holdings believes strongly in the efficacy of our products and has a zero-tolerance approach to regulatory noncompliance and continues to monitor this vigilantly.”
Zoono Holdings also worked with the E.P.A. to bring the product in question into compliance so that it is now qualified as a disinfectant effective against the virus that causes Covid-19, Mr. Herriott said.
Efforts to reach officials with Zoono USA on Thursday night were not immediately successful.
The companies are not the first to be held accountable.
And in an unrelated criminal case in June, a New Jersey man pleaded guilty in federal court to selling an unregistered pesticide, wire fraud and presenting false claims. Prosecutors said he illegally sold $2.7 million worth of pesticides that he falsely claimed had been registered with the E.P.A."
2022-09-23,"Talks between the National Football League and Apple over a package of Sunday football games have dragged as the league and the tech giant have wrangled over pricing, but another deal has been added to the mix: sponsorship of the Super Bowl halftime show.
The N.F.L. has been seeking as much as $2.5 billion for rights to N.F.L. Sunday Ticket, about $1 billion more than what it collects from its current provider, DirecTV. As the sides squabble over a rights fee that high, Apple has agreed to be the main sponsor of the Super Bowl halftime show, the league and the company said late Thursday. They did not disclose terms of the deal.
Apple Music will replace Pepsi as sponsor in a deal that the N.F.L. had been shopping around for about $50 million, said three people familiar with the negotiations.
Becoming the primary sponsor of the Super Bowl halftime show is a departure for Apple. The company has prided itself on marketing its brand differently than consumer goods companies such as Coca-Cola, Budweiser and McDonald’s, which have long histories of sponsoring sports and cultural events.
ADVERTISEMENT

Apple seldom sponsors events that it does not control. It has not lent its brand to a high-profile event since 2016, when it sponsored the Met Gala in a bid to increase acceptance of its Apple Watch within the world of fashion.
The stalemate on the much larger deal between Apple and the N.F.L. is hampering the league’s efforts to become a leader in the streaming of live sports. With consumers abandoning traditional television packages, Roger Goodell, the N.F.L.’s commissioner, has put a priority on expanding the league’s reach beyond traditional broadcasters to digital media such as Netflix and HBO Max, where younger viewers are turning their attention.
Last year, the league cut a string of traditional broadcast agreements with CBS, ESPN, Fox and NBC for its highest-profile games, but it reserved two packages for tech companies that it considered to be the sports programmers of tomorrow. It struck an 11-year, $13 billion deal with Amazon to stream Thursday night games, and it announced that it would sell its Sunday Ticket to a streaming service.
Though the N.F.L. has discussed Sunday Ticket with Google, Amazon and ESPN, its most extensive negotiations have been with Apple. Executives at both the league and the tech giant have told business partners that they expect to get a deal done, according to the people familiar with the negotiations. But the talks have been complicated by the N.F.L.’s decision to sell several assets simultaneously, including Sunday Ticket, the halftime show and N.F.L. Media properties such as N.F.L. Network and the RedZone channel.
One of the biggest problems has been the N.F.L.’s asking price of $2.5 billion. The $1 billion increase from the current deal would be difficult to win from a traditional media company but has been especially tough to capture from Apple, which has deep pockets and an interest in branching into sports but also an unyielding commitment to profitability that leads it to squeeze suppliers.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The N.F.L. has signaled its frustration with Apple by reaching out to representatives at other media companies to encourage them to put forward a bid, according to two people familiar with the outreach. But some of those companies have been wary of becoming a tool that the N.F.L. can use to induce a bigger offer from Apple.
“While the foundation and cornerstones of the deal are in place, the devil is always in the details, particularly in a deal that has complex elements that extend beyond the historic Sunday Ticket rights,” said William Mao, a senior media rights executive at Octagon, a sports and entertainment agency.
Apple has pursued Sunday Ticket as part of a broader strategy to increase subscriptions to its streaming service, Apple TV+, by tapping into the popularity of live sports. Despite pouring billions of dollars a year into critically acclaimed series such as “The Morning Show” and “Ted Lasso,” Apple’s three-year-old service has only about 16 million subscribers in the United States, fewer than half the subscribers Disney+ has accumulated since launching around the same time, according to Antenna, a media research firm.

Leaders at Apple have told Hollywood executives that acquiring Sunday Ticket would increase viewership of its shows. The N.F.L. remains one of television’s biggest draws, with its games accounting for three-quarters of the top 100 most-watched programs last year, according to Sports Business Journal.

In recent months, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, and Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of services, have met with the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, and the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones, who are leading the league’s negotiations, the people familiar with the negotiations said.
The idea of Apple’s sponsoring the Super Bowl halftime show bubbled up in the course of the talks as a way to deepen the business ties. The N.F.L. needed a replacement for Pepsi and recognized that Apple had tapped its marketing budget to win rights to live sports. The company offered Major League Baseball $55 million in rights fees for two weekly Friday baseball games, and an additional $30 million in advertising, according to two people familiar with the agreement. Forbes earlier reported the terms of the deal.
The discussions between the N.F.L. and Apple over the Super Bowl halftime threatened to delay the league’s release of this season’s performers, some of these people said. The N.F.L. and Jay-Z’s entertainment company, Roc Nation, which produces the show, last year announced the artists in September, giving the league ample time to build anticipation. Organizers are eager to build on last year’s event, the Super Bowl’s first hip-hop performance, a celebration of rap that made history by winning three Emmy Awards.
Jay-Z and Roc Nation are expected to continue to take the lead on selecting artists and choosing performers for the event, but Apple will be able to weigh in on the direction of the show, according to a person familiar with the deal.
A spokeswoman for Roc Nation did not respond to requests for comment.
The tech company and the hip-hop pioneer make for strange bedfellows. In 2015, Jay-Z bought a streaming-music service, Tidal, and made his song catalog exclusive to the service, depriving Apple Music of albums such as “The Blueprint.” Two years later, he released much of his catalog to Apple and eventually exited the streaming-music business, selling Tidal to Square for nearly $300 million in 2021.

2022-09-26,"Dara Treseder, who has been Peloton’s chief marketing officer since 2020, is leaving the ailing exercise equipment maker to run marketing at Autodesk, a move that comes two weeks after Peloton’s co-founder and former chief executive, John Foley, announced his exit amid a broader management shake-up.
A spokesman for the company wished Ms. Treseder luck, adding that she had helped to more than double its membership to more than 6.9 million, the DealBook newsletter reported.
The executive departures leave in question the future of the brand.
Ms. Treseder, who will remain as Peloton’s head of global marketing and communications through Oct. 4, helped oversee the introduction of four new products, including its $3,195 rowing machine. Ms. Treseder, who had previously worked at Apple, Goldman Sachs and General Electric, also set up a content partnership with Beyoncé.
Mr. Foley had been the public face of the brand since its founding in 2012; Ms. Treseder called him “the greatest of all time.” Peloton said earlier this month that Hisao Kushi, another founder and the company’s chief legal officer, will depart on Oct. 3.

Ms. Treseder’s exit comes amid a broader restructuring. The pandemic darling of home workouts has had to pump the brakes on its rapid expansion in the past year as demand fizzled once lockdown measures were eased.
In an effort to revive the business, Peloton hired Barry McCarthy, the former Spotify chief financial officer, as its chief executive in February; he has since focused on trimming costs and revamping the subscription model.
Peloton has laid off workers, announced plans to close stores, outsourced production and sell its bikes on Amazon. It’s been an uphill battle: Peloton reported a $1.2 billion loss in the fourth quarter, its sixth straight quarterly loss, and shares are down 75 percent through the year.
Marketing is key to its turnaround plans. The pandemic made Peloton’s workout bikes a household name, but sales plummeted as gyms reopened and demand for its products waned. And negative depictions of its products on TV series like “And Just Like That,” the “Sex and the City” revival, and “Billions” caused the company’s stock price to drop.
“Covid was the marketing campaign the company could never have afforded,” Mr. McCarthy told DealBook in February. Now, he wants to put Peloton’s fitness-focused app at the center of marketing efforts as the company looks to slash operating costs by $800 million this year.

Murphy beds have always served a purpose as space-savers in small urban apartments. With the pandemic, however, as more suburbanites have been working from home, even they have turned to Murphy beds as they eke the most out of their home offices while keeping the background of their Zoom calls free of a rather intimate piece of furniture.
According to market research from Resource Furniture, which specializes in transforming furniture and has its headquarters in New York, about 40 percent of its clients who bought wall beds last year live in single-family homes with three or more bedrooms. From 2020 to 2021, Resource’s sales increased 60 percent, with wall beds accounting for over half the increase.
The Murphy bed was invented by William Lawrence Murphy, who patented his design in 1911. According to Smithsonian magazine, the bed’s invention was a means of avoiding a salacious situation: Its creator wanted to entertain his opera singer sweetheart at his San Francisco studio, but propriety demanded that his bed be out of sight. A bed that folded into his closet did the trick.
Despite their sexy origin story, Murphy beds have historically been played for laughs in pop culture — even as far back as the 1916 film “One A.M.,” which shows Charlie Chaplin drunkenly fumbling around a floppy wall bed. Eventually, Murphy beds became so ubiquitous that in 1989, a federal appeals court in New York found that the name had grown too generic to retain its trademark. Now, “Murphy bed” and “wall bed” are used interchangeably.

Economic conditions also play a role in the wall bed’s popularity. Challie Stillman, the vice president for sales and design at Resource Furniture, noted that the last time the company’s Murphy beds (which are made by the Italian manufacturer Clei) had a marquee moment was during the 2008 recession.
“Our business took off because people were really forced to remain in their existing homes rather than upgrading, so they were trying to make more use of what they already had,” Ms. Stillman said. With another recession possibly on the way and inflation already here, Ms. Stillman said Resource was forecasting a similar increase.
Murphy beds now come in a range of options, and can accommodate any size mattress, from twin to king. Prices range from about $1,000 to $20,000, which gets you a lot of frills like a couch and shelving. While the beds once had a reputation for being flimsy, today they use piston and spring mechanisms that make them more secure.
Ryan Jestin, an owner of the Mod Barn, a Los Angeles furniture design store, prefers the spring mechanism. “It’s just one panel that folds down with the mattress, so it looks much more visually appealing this way,” he said. His most popular model, a bed that folds out of the frame and has a couple of cubbies, starts around $4,800.

There are also prefabricated options. Michelle Allen, a 49-year-old product designer, bought a queen-size version from Amazon for around $1,800 to install in the art studio of her Vancouver home. Her husband and son put the bed together in about three or four hours, she estimated. “I’m fairly handy, but you probably wanted somebody with a little bit of tool experience,” Ms. Allen said.

Bespoke varieties exist, too, and Mr. Jestin has designed Murphy beds for more than 20 years. He enjoys working with them because “they transition your room so much,” he said.
Mr. Jestin has designed wall beds with sliding bookcases in front and others with desks attached to the outside that fold up when the beds come down. He has even built a kid’s playhouse with a Murphy bed inside (and an interactive Lego front).
Others have taken to designing and constructing the beds themselves. Last fall, Jocelyn Folaron, 26, was a nursing student living in a three-bedroom house in Buffalo, N.Y., with her husband and four dogs. One of the bedrooms was small — too small to comfortably plop a bed in it while still having the space for other uses — so Ms. Folaron, who runs the Cheeky DIY Home blog, built one.

“If you can kill two birds with one stone, I’m that kind of person,” she said. The unit cost her about $800 total.

Using a hardware kit from Create-A-Bed in Louisville, Ky., she built a full-size Murphy bed. It took Ms. Folaron about two months to complete the room, though the system she used could be built in two days. Between the mechanism, wood and screws, her bed cost around $800 to build.
The resulting room is what she described as “dark and moody” with a walnut-stained Murphy bed, forest green vertical shiplap wall and gold accents. Ms. Folaron has since graduated from nursing school and moved with her husband to a new home in Tucson, Ariz., where she is once again considering adding a Murphy bed.

“If you can kill two birds with one stone, I’m that kind of person,” she said, adding that “being able to design it and make it more modern-looking is ideal.”
In addition to their functionality, another part of Murphy beds’ appeal is the element of surprise and delight they add to a room.

Genevieve White Carter and Cy Carter, married interior designers who live in St. James, N.Y., designed a home Venice, Calif., where they color-matched a Murphy bed’s unit to a pink oxford shirt. When the bed is up, even the built-in shelves with knickknacks are concealed — on Zoom calls, the clients’ colleagues thought it was a just cool pink wall. “I do think that there’s kind of a fun, secret-y element about it, as well as it being practical and utilitarian,” Mr. Carter said.
The designers have since pitched Murphy beds to several residential and commercial clients — often to delighted response. “The client is like a little kid,” Mr. Carter said. “I think that there is a part of it of like, ‘Oh look, this whole other room comes down, like a secret passageway.’”"
2022-09-28,"Less than two years after announcing their intention to give away a vast fortune together, the billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott and her husband, Dan Jewett, a former science teacher, are parting ways.
Ms. Scott filed a petition for divorce in the King County Superior Court in Washington State on Monday, according to a copy of the filing. The breakup punctuates an eventful period for Ms. Scott, who in less than four years got divorced from her longtime husband, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave away more than $12 billion to nonprofits and married an instructor at the prestigious school attended by her children.
Court records show Mr. Jewett did not contest the divorce. The petition says any division of property is laid out in a separation contract, agreed to by the couple, which is not public. Both still live in King County, the filing says, which includes the city of Seattle.
Their marriage, which garnered significant public attention after Ms. Scott’s divorce from the world’s richest man, had also been a philanthropic partnership, with Mr. Jewett publicly promising to join her in donating their enormous fortune to good causes.

But there were recent signs that the partnership was no more. Previously, grateful nonprofits that had received grants from Ms. Scott and Mr. Jewett thanked them both, but recent recipients thank her alone.
In the past week his name vanished from her philanthropic endeavors. On the site for the Giving Pledge, where billionaires promise to give away half of their wealth before they die, his letter no longer appeared with hers. Without fanfare, his name was recently edited out of a Medium post Ms. Scott had written last year about their gifts.
Ms. Scott, a novelist, also deleted Mr. Jewett from her author bio on Amazon, the online retailer that is the source of her vast wealth.
She rocketed to global attention as she began giving away money at a pace rarely seen in the philanthropic world. After her divorce from Mr. Bezos, Ms. Scott assembled a team of advisers and began quietly making multimillion-dollar donations to nonprofit groups that totaled more than $12 billion in just three years.
In her May 2019 letter on the Giving Pledge, Ms. Scott promised to “keep at it until the safe is empty.” Bloomberg has estimated her net worth as high as $62 billion, but between her billions of dollars in contributions and the decline in the stock market, it now gauges her fortune at $27.8 billion.

Two years later, in his own Giving Pledge letter, Mr. Jewett sounded full of enthusiasm. “I am married to one of the most generous and kind people I know — and joining her in a commitment to pass on an enormous financial wealth to serve others,” he wrote.
Yet he also noted that he had not previously considered making any kind of public statement about his charitable priorities because he had “never sought to gather the kind of wealth required to feel like saying such a thing would have particular meaning.”
As recently as last week, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which preserves old versions of web pages, his letter was still twinned with hers on the site, accompanied by a photo of the two of them looking as though they were out for a hike together. Today there is just a headshot of Ms. Scott, along with her letter.
Ms. Scott has refused to speak publicly about her giving, declining repeated interview requests from news organizations including The New York Times. Her lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Attempts to reach Mr. Jewett through friends, family and former colleagues and at an address associated with him in Seattle were unsuccessful. His lawyer declined, through a legal assistant, to comment on the divorce.
Ms. Scott made her charitable announcements in long posts on Medium that listed the names of organizations that received billions of dollars cumulatively.

Last month, Ms. Scott gave two homes in Beverly Hills, valued at a combined $55 million, to the California Community Foundation. The foundation’s affordable housing grant-making functions will receive 90 percent of the value of the properties. Mr. Jewett’s name, which had been in recent gift announcements, was nowhere in the news release.
The Health Forward Foundation in Kansas City, Mo., announced on Tuesday that it had received a $15 million gift from Ms. Scott. The Episcopal Health Foundation in Houston also recently announced that it had received a $20 million grant from Ms. Scott. Neither announcement mentioned Mr. Jewett.
Mr. Jewett taught at the Lakeside School, the prestigious Seattle private school attended by the Bezos children, where he was popular among students and fellow teachers alike.
“He’s earnest, not very edgy,” said Angela Loihl, who met Mr. Jewett through a mutual friend. Ms. Loihl, who spent weeks in 2014 with Mr. Jewett driving in a small-motored car from London to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, recalled how that mutual friend had told her years later, after he married Ms. Scott, “He’s the perfect person to end up with this money to give away — no sense of greed at all.”
According to the divorce filing, the couple married in California in 2021. The news of their marriage took even Mr. Jewett’s friends and colleagues by surprise — producing a whirlwind of news coverage far beyond his expectations, as reporters even appeared on the Lakeside campus. Though he finished the term there, Mr. Jewett felt his presence on campus was a distraction.

His new wife had become arguably the most influential philanthropist in the world with an approach that emphasized huge grants — often the largest single gift a group had received — with no strings attached.
In his Giving Pledge letter published in March 2021, Mr. Jewett wrote that he was “grateful for the exceptional privilege it will be to partner in giving away assets with the potential to do so much good when shared.”
In June 2021, Ms. Scott posted about her giving on Medium, where she wrote: “Me, Dan, a constellation of researchers and administrators and advisers — we are all attempting to give away a fortune that was enabled by systems in need of change.” Sometime in the past week, searches on the Internet Archive showed, the post was edited, and Mr. Jewett’s name removed from there as well.

2022-09-29,"Disney’s “Hocus Pocus” is one of the company’s few true cult classics; after an initial negative reception when it was released in 1993, the Halloween-themed comedy starring Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker as a trio of campy witch sisters gained a fan base through seasonal VHS rentals and repeated airings on ABC and the Disney Channel. And while its new sequel, “Hocus Pocus 2,” may be a blatant attempt by Disney to continue propping up its streaming platform Disney+ (where the movie has its debut), it manages to capture the same hokey magic of the original while creatively updating its humor.
In a slight retread of the first film’s plot, “Hocus Pocus 2” follows two present-day Salem teenagers, Becca and Izzy (Whitney Peak and Belissa Escobedo), who accidentally bring the witchy Sanderson sisters back to life while performing their yearly Halloween night ritual. (The teens’ interest in witchcraft and the occult is benign, a very 2022 detail that might not have come across the same way 30 years ago.) High jinks ensue as the girls race to stop the witches from kidnapping the town’s genial mayor (Tony Hale) and casting an immortality spell that would make them all-powerful, while also making amends with their former friend, the mayor’s daughter, Cassie (Lilia Buckingham).
Anne Fletcher (“Step Up,” “The Proposal”) directs this sequel, but follows the same goofy comedic approach of the Kenny Ortega-directed first film — namely, how the sisters react to modern inventions like robot vacuums, Amazon’s Alexa and Walgreens. Even a few meta-jokes nod to the Sanderson sisters’ popularity in the world of drag. Thankfully, with a cast rounded out by Doug Jones, Hannah Waddingham and Sam Richardson, the brew-haha’s aren’t solely concentrated in the three leads.

2022-09-30,"A new medication for A.L.S., the devastating neurological disorder that causes paralysis and death, will have a list price of $158,000 a year, its manufacturer disclosed Friday.
The treatment, to be marketed as Relyvrio, is a combination of two existing drugs and will be available to patients in the United States in about four to six weeks, according to officials of the company, Amylyx Pharmaceuticals.
Relyvrio was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, even though the agency’s analysis concluded there was not yet sufficient evidence that the medication could help patients live longer or slow the rate at which they lose functions like muscle control, speaking or breathing without assistance.
The F.D.A. decided to greenlight the drug instead of waiting until 2024 for results of a large clinical trial partly because the treatment is considered to be safe. The agency said that although the evidence of effectiveness was uncertain, “given the serious and life-threatening nature of A.L.S. and the substantial unmet need, this level of uncertainty is acceptable in this instance.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A.L.S., or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — also called Lou Gehrig’s disease — often strikes patients in the prime of life and frequently causes death within two to five years. It is diagnosed in about 6,000 people worldwide each year, and Amylyx estimates that there are about 29,000 people living with the disease in the United States.
Amylyx officials predicted that most patients would pay little or nothing for the treatment because the company expects insurers, both private and public, to cover it. Amylyx plans to provide it free to uninsured patients experiencing financial hardship.
Still, the list price is much higher than that recommended by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit organization that evaluates the value of medicines. In a statement, the group’s chief medical officer, Dr. David Rind, said that while “there are clear benefits to patients with a rapidly fatal disease to have early access to a safe therapy,” his organization had concluded that “an annual price of $9,100 to $30,700 would be reasonable if the therapy actually works.”
Dr. Rind added that “while awaiting proof, we believe that patients would benefit from a price closer to the price of production of Relyvrio rather than a price more than five times higher than the top of a value-based range.”
During an investor conference call on Friday, Justin Klee, a founder of Amylyx, said the price was chosen after meeting with insurers, patients, doctors and others. He said the company considered what would allow it to “invest in new treatments so that A.L.S. first becomes a manageable chronic condition and ultimately is cured,” and added that the price “allows Amylyx to sustain programs to help people who can benefit from Relyvrio access it.”

The F.D.A. has approved only two other A.L.S. medications. Riluzole, a tablet approved in 1995, can extend survival by several months and generally costs significantly less than $10,000 a year. Edaravone, marketed as Radicava, can slow symptom progression by about 33 percent. Radicava, which was originally approved in 2017 as an intravenous infusion, was approved this year in an oral form that carries a list price of $171,000 a year. Amylyx officials said they expected that, as in the company’s clinical trials, many patients would take Relyvrio, a powder that is mixed with water, along with one or both of the other medications.
Relyvrio was conceived by the founders of Amylyx, Mr. Klee and Joshua Cohen, when they were undergraduate students at Brown University less than a decade ago. They proposed that combining taurursodiol, an over-the-counter supplement sometimes used to regulate liver enzymes, and sodium phenylbutyrate, a prescription medication for a pediatric urea disorder, could protect neurons in the brain from damage in diseases like A.L.S. by preventing dysfunction of two structures in cells: mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.
In an interview, Mr. Klee said the company expected that private insurers would cover the drug with no co-payments for patients, and he said that Amylyx would work to make it affordable for people on Medicare or Medicaid and provide it free to those without insurance who are financially struggling. Mr. Klee noted that patients had been obtaining the ingredients on their own for some time, buying the taurursodiol supplement from Amazon and paying up to $11,000 a month for the sodium phenylbutyrate.
“Now that our product is approved, we have to be laser-focused on making sure that people can access it,” Mr. Klee said.
Relyvrio’s clinical trials included patients who developed symptoms of A.L.S. within 18 months before the trial and were affected in at least three body regions, which is generally a sign of fast-progressing disease. The F.D.A.’s approval did not restrict which patients could use the medication. Mr. Cohen said in an interview that Amylyx didn’t have projections of how many would.

“There are patients who are just receiving the diagnosis today, and there are patients who are making end-of-life decisions today, and I think that people in different circumstances are going to make very different treatment decisions,” he said.
Amylyx has also conducted a small trial of Relyvrio in Alzheimer’s patients, and Mr. Cohen discussed plans to test it for other neurodevelopmental disorders.
“We conceived the drug to try to target pathways of neuronal death,” he said, “and neuronal death is an important part of not just A.L.S. but potentially many diseases.”"
2022-10-01,"The natural resources that Indigenous peoples depend on are inextricably linked to their identities, cultures and livelihoods. Even relatively small changes in temperature or rainfall can make their lands more susceptible to rising sea levels, droughts and forest fires. As the climate crisis escalates, activists fighting to protect what remain of the world’s forests are at risk of being persecuted by their governments — and even at risk of death.
For decades Indigenous activists have been sounding the alarm. But their warnings have too often been ignored. So, they organized.
Indigenous peoples and communities, working in the Americas, Indonesia and Africa joined forces and together became the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities. They work to protect their rights and territories, amounting to nearly 3.5 million square miles of land across the planet.

“Our spiritual, ritualistic and cultural practices are closely linked to the flow of nature. We use the rivers as a means of transport, but the rains have become scarce, isolating many communities. Several species — flora and fauna — are disappearing, which has led to a shortage of food and has limited our ability to perform certain rituals. This has had a dramatic impact on our culture. The cause is partly climate change, but these changes can also be linked to our government’s dismantling of environmental policy.” — Dinamam Tuxá, the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, Brazil.

Working across multiple languages and political and legal systems, the alliance settled on five priorities: land rights, free prior and informed consent before any intervention into their territories, direct access to climate funding, protection of people from violence and prosecution, and the recognition of traditional knowledge in the fight to defend the planet.
In September, members of the alliance and their allies visited New York to meet with policymakers and donors during Climate Week, which brings together international leaders to push for global climate action.

Brazilians are voting for president today in an election between two political heavyweights: Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right incumbent, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president. To help you understand the election, I spoke to Jack Nicas, The Times’s Brazil bureau chief, who lives in Rio de Janeiro.
Claire Moses: Hi Jack. This is quite an election.
Jack Nicas: It is. We reporters often say any given election is a big deal — but everyone here seems to agree that this one really is Brazil’s biggest vote in decades. Bolsonaro and Lula are perhaps the most prominent names in the modern history of Brazilian politics, and they come with a lot of baggage. They’re either loved or hated. People aren’t usually in-between on either.
Bolsonaro is a right-wing populist who has divided the country. He has fervent supporters on the right, and the left just abhors him and wants him out. Lula led Brazil during a time of tremendous growth, but then he served time in prison on corruption charges, which were later thrown out. He’s been leading in the polls.
Is it mostly political junkies who are obsessed with the election — or ordinary people, too?
It’s everyone. People are wearing their political colors visibly. If you see people wearing yellow and green, the colors of the Brazilian flag, you can probably bet that they’re Bolsonaro supporters. On the other side, people are wearing red, the color of the left-wing Workers’ Party, which is Lula’s party. People are eager to show off their political leanings and happy to debate them. The campaign is kind of in-your-face that way.

Beach towels are another example. You see vendors selling these towels with enormous prints of Lula’s or Bolsonaro’s face. Some of the vendors keep track of sales and post them on a sign — a sort of informal presidential poll.
There have been huge rallies across the country. Just down the street from me here in the Copacabana neighborhood, thousands of people gathered last month to celebrate Brazil’s 200 years of independence. In name it was a national celebration, but in practice it was a political rally for Bolsonaro. To avoid confrontations, Lula asked his supporters to attend a different rally on another day.

The fact that people wear the national colors to support Bolsonaro makes me wonder about soccer jerseys. Will people still wear the iconic jerseys of Brazil’s national team even if they don’t support Bolsonaro?
The national team has been the pride of Brazil for so long. But now its jersey is also a symbol of Bolsonaro supporters. How will Brazil cope with that during the upcoming World Cup in November, weeks after such a contentious election?
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
You’ve also reported on Bolsonaro’s antidemocratic moves, such as casting doubt on the country’s voting system, despite no evidence of fraud. American readers might see similarities with Donald Trump, with whom Bolsonaro has forged close ties. Is the state of democracy as big a topic in Brazil as it is in the U.S.?
It’s one of the biggest questions overhanging this election (along with a sputtering economy, rising hunger and the destruction of the Amazon). People saw what happened in the U.S. in 2020, and they know about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. On the left, people are worried about a similar situation here because of Bolsonaro’s rhetoric. He was one of the last world leaders to recognize Joe Biden as the winner of the election.
Bolsonaro has said repeatedly that he sees three possible outcomes in this election for him: He wins, he’s put in jail or he’s dead. Those are aggressive words that worry a lot of people. From our reporting, it appears that institutions like the courts and Congress are prepared to stand up to an election challenge by Bolsonaro. And the armed forces, which had also been questioning the voting systems, now also don’t seem to have any interest in backing a coup.
The bigger threat may be that Bolsonaro’s supporters take to the streets if he doesn’t accept a loss. Many Bolsonaro supporters believe that Lula’s team and election officials are set on rigging the election. That belief doesn’t have any basis in the truth, but years of false claims by Bolsonaro have persuaded a large portion of the population.
What about Lula’s campaign strategy?
In a way, Lula’s campaign has been very Biden-esque. Even though Lula is much more of a leftist than Biden, he has also tried to build a broad coalition and appeal to the center. And like Biden, given his time as vice president, Lula has already spent eight years in the presidential offices. He’s a well-known face, and he’s trying to play it safe against an unpopular incumbent.

We should know the result, and whether there will be a runoff, around 7 p.m. Eastern tonight. Just because Lula is leading in the polls doesn’t mean something unpredictable can’t happen here.
Jack Nicas leads The Times’s coverage of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. Brazilians were fascinated by his efforts to translate the Portuguese words “tchutchuca” and “imbrochável” in his election coverage — two slightly vulgar words that each had their campaign moments.

2022-10-03,"RIO DE JANEIRO — For months, pollsters and analysts had said that President Jair Bolsonaro was doomed. He faced a wide and unwavering deficit in Brazil’s high-stakes presidential race, and in recent weeks, the polls had suggested he could even lose in the first round, ending his presidency after just one term.
Instead, it was Mr. Bolsonaro who was celebrating. While the challenger, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former leftist president, finished the night ahead, Mr. Bolsonaro far outperformed forecasts and sent the race to a runoff.
Mr. da Silva received 48.4 percent of the votes, and Mr. Bolsonaro 43.23 percent, with 99.87 percent of the ballots counted, according to Brazil’s elections agency. Mr. da Silva needed to exceed 50 percent to be elected president in the first round.
They will face off on Oct. 30 in what is widely regarded as the most important vote in decades for Latin America’s largest nation.

That is partly because of the starkly different visions the two men set forth for this country of 217 million people, and partly because Brazil faces a host of challenges, including environmental threats, rising hunger, a sputtering economy and a deeply polarized population.

But the election will also be widely watched in Brazil and abroad because it is seen as a major test for one of the world’s largest democracies. For months, Mr. Bolsonaro has criticized the nation’s electronic voting machines as rife with fraud — without any evidence — and has suggested that the only way he would lose is if the election is rigged.
Mr. Bolsonaro told reporters late Sunday that he “overcame the lies” in the polls and that he felt he now had an advantage in the second round. Even with the positive results, he also suggested there could have been fraud, saying he would wait for the military to check the results.
“Our system is not 100 percent ironclad,” he said. “There’s always the possibility of something abnormal happening in a fully computerized system.”

Mr. Bolsonaro had claimed for months that the polls were underestimating his support, using his enormous rallies as evidence. Yet, virtually every poll showed him behind. On Sunday, it was clear that he was right. He performed better in all of Brazil’s 27 states than what Ipec, one of Brazil’s biggest polling firms, had predicted a day before the election, exceeding the projections by at least 8 percentage points in 10 states.

Pollsters appeared to misjudge the strength of conservative candidates across the country. Governors and lawmakers supported by Mr. Bolsonaro also outperformed polls, winning many of their races on Sunday.
Cláudio Castro, the right-wing governor of Rio de Janeiro state, was re-elected in a landslide, with 58 percent of votes, 11 percentage points more than Ipec’s projection. At least seven of Mr. Bolsonaro’s former ministers were also elected to Congress, including his former environment minister, who oversaw skyrocketing deforestation in the Amazon, and his former health minister, who was widely criticized for Brazil’s delay in buying vaccines during the pandemic.
Antonio Lavareda, the president of Ipespe, another top polling company, defended his firm's research, pointing out that it had predicted Mr. da Silva would finish with 49 percent, versus the 48 percent he received.
Yet Ipespe also predicted Mr. Bolsonaro would receive 35 percent of the vote, more than 8 percentage points below his actual support. The poll’s margin of error was 3 percentage points. (That trend played out across the polls; they were nearly accurate on Mr. da Silva’s support, but far off on Mr. Bolsonaro’s.)

Mr. Lavareda speculated that many voters who had said they would vote for less popular candidates had switched to Mr. Bolsonaro — or that they had lied to the pollsters.
Outside Mr. Bolsonaro’s home in a rich, beachside neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, his supporters gathered to celebrate, dancing and drinking out of plastic cups of beer. Many were wearing the bright yellow jerseys of Brazil’s national soccer team, which has become a sort of uniform for many of Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters. (The president wore one to vote, over what appeared to be a flak jacket or protective vest.)
“We expected he would have an advantage of 70 percent” of the votes, said Silvana Maria Lenzir, 65, a retiree with stickers of Mr. Bolsonaro’s face covering her chest. “Polls do not reflect reality.”

Still, over the next four weeks, Mr. Bolsonaro will have to make up ground on Mr. da Silva, who held the top spot on Sunday. The right-wing president is trying to avoid becoming the first incumbent to lose his re-election bid since the start of Brazil’s modern democracy in 1988.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
At the same time, Mr. da Silva is trying to complete a stunning political revival that years ago had seemed unthinkable.
While Mr. da Silva ended the night as the front-runner, his speech to supporters took on a somber tone. But he said he welcomed the chance to now debate Mr. Bolsonaro one-on-one.
“We can compare the Brazil he built and the Brazil we built,” he said. “Tomorrow the campaign starts.”
A former metalworker and union leader with a fifth-grade education, Mr. da Silva led Brazil during its boom in the first decade of the century. He was then convicted on corruption charges after he left office and spent 580 days in prison. Last year, the Supreme Court threw out those charges, ruling the judge in his cases was biased, and voters have since rallied behind the man known simply as Lula.
The two men are the country’s most prominent — and polarizing — politicians. The left in Brazil views Mr. Bolsonaro as a dangerous threat to the nation’s democracy and its standing on the world stage, while the country’s conservatives see Mr. da Silva as an ex-convict who was a central part of a vast corruption scheme that helped rot Brazil’s institutions.

Mr. da Silva has built his campaign around broad promises for a better future, including a pledge that all Brazilians should be able to enjoy three meals a day. His rallies have also heavily leaned on his Everyman image, with plenty of references to beer, cachaça and picanha, Brazil’s most famous cut of meat.
Mr. Bolsonaro, 67, has made his campaign about protecting Brazil’s conservative traditions from what he says are threats from leftist elites. He has made his campaign slogan “God, family, homeland and liberty,” and he has vowed to fight against things like legalized drugs, legalized abortion, transgender rights and restrictions on freedom of religion and free speech.
Mr. Bolsonaro wants to further increase access to firearms, repeating in his stump speech that “armed people will never be enslaved.” One of his main accomplishments during his first term was soaring gun ownership.

Facing a wide gap in polls, Mr. Bolsonaro recently expanded social welfare for poor families, and he has pledged to continue those policies during his second term.
Mr. Bolsonaro has also said he wants to sell Brazil’s state-owned oil company, make it easier to mine in the Amazon rainforest and continue to reduce regulations on industry. Many businesses have welcomed Mr. Bolsonaro’s free-market approach, but it has led to soaring environmental destruction.

The election could be consequential for the world’s largest rainforest. While Mr. Bolsonaro has said he would crack down on environmental violations, he has cut funding and staffing for the agencies tasked with enforcing environmental laws, while casting doubt on statistics that show the destruction of the forest during his first term.
Mr. da Silva campaigned on a promise to eradicate illegal mining and logging, and said he would push farmers to use areas of the forest that had already been cleared.

Mr. da Silva’s election would extend a string of leftist victories across Latin America, fueled by a wave of anti-incumbent backlash. If elected, six of the region’s seven largest countries will have chosen leftist leaders since 2018.
Mr. Bolsonaro’s first term has been marked by turmoil, including clashes with the courts, corruption scandals and a pandemic that killed more people than anywhere other than the United States. But it has been his suggestions that he won’t relinquish power if he is voted out that has alarmed many Brazilians and the international community.
Last year, Mr. Bolsonaro told his supporters there were three outcomes to the election: He wins, he is killed or he is arrested. He then added, “Tell the bastards I’ll never be arrested.”
Mr. Bolsonaro has questioned Brazil’s electronic voting machines for years, despite the fact that there has been no evidence of widespread fraud in the system since Brazil began using it in the late 1990s.
Four days before Sunday’s vote, his political party released a two-page document that claimed, without evidence, that some government employees and contractors had the “absolute power to manipulate election results without leaving a trace.” Election officials called those claims “false and dishonest” and “a clear attempt to hinder and disrupt” the election.

Stocks rose sharply again on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous day and rebounding from a painful decline in September, as some investors bet that the rapid pace of interest rate increases that have raised costs for companies may soon begin to moderate.
The S&P 500 rose 3.1 percent on Tuesday, its largest one-day gain since May 2020 and the early recovery from the market turmoil induced by the coronavirus pandemic. The gain added to a rise of 2.6 percent on Monday.
Some investors are beginning to anticipate that with some signs of inflation easing and economic growth slowing, a peak in interest rates may come sooner than anticipated. Such an outcome would provide relief for companies that are expected to report a drop in quarterly earnings in their latest batch of reports, which they will begin to release this month.
However, the view that inflation and interest rates have peaked has been undermined before, and rallies like this week’s have been short-lived. The last time the S&P 500 posted two consecutive days of gains in excess of 2.5 percent each was in December 2008. The index fell a further 25 percent from then before hitting its low in March 2009.

“With sentiment toward equities already very weak, periodic rebounds are to be expected,” said Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “But markets are likely to stay volatile in the near term, driven primarily by expectations around inflation and policy rates.”
Nevertheless, investors have been looking for indications that the Federal Reserve could let up its campaign to raise interest rates. A government report on Tuesday offered hope, showing a larger-than-expected decline in job openings in August, although hiring, quitting and layoffs remained steady.
Signs of a slowing labor market would reinforce the view that inflation could more consistently fall in the coming months, removing pressure on the Fed to tighten its policy so aggressively. Amazon is freezing corporate hiring in its retail business, according to a company memo, a division where about 20,000 job openings were recently posted. Facebook’s parent, Meta, told employees last week that it would freeze hiring and reduce budgets across most of its teams.

Tuesday’s rally was driven by a rise in the stock prices of companies that suffered the most through the pandemic-induced slowdown and, curtailed by higher inflation and interest rates, have yet to fully benefit from the economic recovery that came from the loosening of Covid restrictions. The cruise operator Royal Caribbean rose more than 16 percent and the casino company Caesars Entertainment gained more than 11 percent. The airlines Delta and American both rose more than 8 percent.
Twitter jumped more than 22 percent after Elon Musk proposed going ahead with a deal to acquire the company at the price originally agreed, potentially ending the legal fight over whether the billionaire could pull out of the agreement struck nearly six months ago.

Positive sentiment echoed around the globe, bolstered by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the country’s central bank, raising interest rates by less than expected on Tuesday, adding to the sense that other central banks might also start to slow the pace of increases.
“The move to a lesser rate hike by the RBA, alongside the weak data on job openings, has given investors a narrative that we could be setting up for a downshift to a less aggressive path of rate hikes,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.
Europe’s Stoxx 600 rose 3.1 percent and the Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 2.6 percent. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 3 percent.
Oil prices — a large input into measures of inflation — also continued their rally on Tuesday. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, rose 3.4 percent to above $86 a barrel, building on a 5 percent gain the day before on reports of supply cuts by major energy producers.
The two-day rally for the S&P 500 still leaves the index down more than 20 percent this year, after it recorded a losing streak of three straight quarters, a grim milestone not seen since 2008.

And economists remain concerned that with inflation still running well above the Fed’s target of 2 percent, the need to raise interest rates further could still tip the U.S. economy into a severe downturn.
“Central banks face a brutal trade-off in this new regime: either live with inflation, or the economic damage needed to tame it quickly,” analysts at BlackRock’s Investment Institute wrote in a recent report. “There’s no way around this.”"

Musk’s about-face
After trying for months to get out of his $44 billion agreement to buy Twitter, Elon Musk told Twitter on Monday night that, actually, he wanted to do the deal — on exactly the original terms. His other big ask: Let’s put the litigation on hold. The two sides are now hashing out next steps, two weeks before they were set to face off in one of the biggest business confrontations of the century.
DealBook has been hitting the phones. Here is what we know — and want to know.
What we know:
Things moved quickly. Twitter got the letter from Musk’s lawyers on Monday, and filed it yesterday morning with the Delaware Chancery Court presiding over the case. In an emergency confidential hearing, the judge instructed the two sides to figure it out and get back to her.
Twitter is wary of pausing its litigation. It’s considering some options in its negotiations with Musk, including getting a court to oversee the deal’s closing (through a consent judgment), and charging Musk interest on any additional time it takes to close the deal.
What we don’t know:
Why did Musk change his mind? Was it a reluctance to be deposed on Thursday and Friday? Concerns of further embarrassing his Silicon Valley and Wall Street friends, à la last week’s text message dump? Some piece of undisclosed bad news? Twitter, incidentally, felt very confident in its chances in the Delaware trial.
Is he still hoping bank financing gives him an out? In his letter to Twitter, Musk says he will do the deal “pending receipt of the proceeds of the debt financing.” (Per the terms of the deal, if the bank financing falls apart, he needs to pay only a $1 billion breakup fee.) The banks have already committed to their $12.5 billion — as long as a deal happens by April 2023. Is Musk hoping they try to back out?
Could Twitter stop Musk from using the banks as an out? One route would be to ask the judge to have the banks say in writing that they remain committed to funding the bid. The company could also ask Musk for a letter saying that he is unaware of any conditions that could impede the deal closing.
Do the banks wish they had an out? The leveraged loan market, which Musk is partly relying upon, has weakened in recent months. If the Citrix deal is any indication, the banks lending to Musk, led by Morgan Stanley, could be sitting on big lending losses. Note: They cannot change the terms of their lending agreement.
What are Larry Ellison, Ben Horowitz and Musk’s other friends going to do? It’s not clear whether any or all of the investors who agreed to chip in $7.1 billion to fund Musk’s deal have an out. (Musk had warned that some equity investors might not “come through.”) Would the text message headache or due diligence concerns give them cold feet?
What are Musk’s plans for Twitter? With the ad market slumping, employee morale sinking and lax security accusations swirling, the company is in worse shape than it was in April. But Musk appears bullish again. “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,” he said. If he goes through with it, “Musk’s Twitter will be a wild ride,” The Times’s Kevin Roose predicts.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
OPEC Plus meets today. The oil-producing group is expected to announce sizable production cuts to try to lift crude prices. But slowing demand in China and Europe and the prospect of a global recession may blunt the effect of such moves.
The U.S. national debt surpasses $31 trillion. The record, reached yesterday, comes as the Fed is raising interest rates to combat inflation. Economists worry that the growing debt load will become too expensive to service over time.
Amazon freezes corporate hiring in its retail business. The announcement covers the retail giant’s physical and online retail business and its logistics operations.
Federal labor officials issue a complaint against Apple. The National Labor Relations Board accused the tech giant of violating labor laws in an effort to stymie union organizers at its World Trade Center store. Meanwhile, Amazon suspended over two dozen workers at a Staten Island warehouse who had refused to work their shifts after a fire at the site.

Will he or won’t he?
Elon Musk dropped a bombshell when he put his original $44 billion offer to buy Twitter back on the table, days ahead of a court battle over his monthslong effort to walk away from that very agreement.
But as the two try to hammer out a renewed deal, Twitter wants to make sure that Musk won’t back out this time, mindful of their lengthy and very public legal feud over the collapse of the first agreement.
Musk had quietly tried to cut the deal’s price tag in recent weeks, The Times reported. He initially sought a discount of as much as 30 percent, which would have valued the social media platform at about $31 billion. But offers of a potential price cut never led to meaningful negotiations or term sheets. Musk’s last effort narrowed the amount to a possible discount of about 10 percent.
Twitter is now focused on ensuring that Musk follows through this time. It has sought reassurances about how the two sides could guarantee closing and a reaffirmation of the specifics in the previously agreed contract. It’s also considering options like court supervision of the closing process and requesting that Musk pay interest to compensate for delays.

Banks loom large. A key issue is whether Musk will try to make the deal contingent on debt financing. Under the terms of the original agreement, he can walk away by paying a $1 billion breakup fee if this does not materialize.
The banks could argue that Musk’s antics have sufficiently damaged Twitter, enough to qualify as a so-called material adverse effect, letting them walk away. He could even try to foil his own deal by, for example, not signing a required letter certifying that Twitter is solvent.
Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the trial, would probably frown on any effort that could be seen as Musk sabotaging his own financing. (In a previous case, she forced an acquirer to follow through on “specific performance” of the agreed contract, adding that the buyers did not use reasonable “best efforts” to secure the financing for the deal. Musk is under the same contractual requirement.)
She could also force Musk to sue the banks under the New York law that governs them, demanding that they follow through on their commitments.

For now, the case goes on. “The parties have not filed a stipulation to stay this action, nor has any party moved for a stay,” McCormick wrote in a legal filing on Wednesday. “I, therefore, continue to press on toward our trial set to begin on Oct. 17.”

A ‘Fed pivot’? Not so fast.
More bad news for the global economy in the past 24 hours.
The World Trade Organization cut its 2023 forecast for global commerce as it expects rising inflation and higher interest rates to sap demand for goods and services. And OPEC Plus announced a bigger-than-expected cut in production as the energy cartel, pushed by Saudi Arabia and Russia, aims to bolster oil prices. The decision created another headache for inflation-focused central bankers and President Biden ahead of midterm elections.
The markets’ reaction? Stocks in Asia and Europe jumped this morning at the open, and U.S. futures had been gaining, too, adding to the down-is-up narrative that has dominated the markets in recent days, with the S&P 500 notching its best two-day rally since the go-go days of spring 2020 at the start of this week.

What’s going on? Investors are pinning their hopes on a big rethink by the Federal Reserve, hoping that policymakers will have little choice but to tap the brakes on interest rate hikes — or even cut rates — to avoid a nasty downturn as global growth slows.
But the “Fed pivot” hypothesis has plenty of skeptics.
Andy Sparks, the head of portfolio management research at MSCI, sees little reason for the investor bullishness. “Yield curve movements over the past week and a half reflect a market belief that the Fed will pivot earlier in 2023 than previously thought. But there is scant new economic data to support this view,” he told DealBook. “Investors with strong beliefs that the pivot will come sooner rather than later may be disappointed.”

Spoiler: Fed policymakers see more interest rate increases. Mary Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told Bloomberg yesterday that the priority was to bring down inflation, which the Cleveland Fed’s data shows is still running hot. That means “staying the course” on raising interest rates, Daly said.
One silver lining for inflation hawks has been crude oil prices, a big factor in calculating core inflation, which have been below $100 a barrel for the past month. But that, too, is looking less promising. Brent crude was trading at $93.30 at 6 a.m. Eastern this morning. It’s climbed roughly 7 percent this week.

Making sense of the puzzling jobs market
Inflation is high, output is down and fears of a recession are looming. But even as the job market has begun to show signs of cooling, it’s still quite strong.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Analysts expect tomorrow’s jobs report to show a healthy increase of 250,000 jobs in September (compared with an increase of 315,000 new jobs in August) and an unemployment rate remaining near a five-decade low. Data released Tuesday showed that even as the number of job openings dipped significantly in August, the number of openings per unemployed worker was around the highest proportion on record, and the number of layoffs remained below the historical average.
There are few signs that the strong job market will fall off a cliff. “We’re all waiting for the significant drop — the free fall — but that is not what we’re seeing,” Becky Frankiewicz, the North American president for ManpowerGroup, a global staffing agency, told The Times last month. “As employment slows down in one industry, it picks up in another industry.”
Why hasn’t there been a free fall? Here are two theories:
Employers are hoarding talent. Companies could be reluctant to reduce head count because they expect the next recession to be mild and short-lived, James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING, told DealBook. “Firms are likely to prefer to hold onto workers and ride out the storm,” Knightley said.
Companies didn’t have enough workers in the first place. Because the job market has been so competitive, companies may actually be understaffed in key places, said Jason Furman, a professor of economic policy at Harvard. “So they were at six, wanted to go to 10,” he said. “Now they want to go to eight, but they’re still at six.” In other words, companies may need fewer workers than they did before the economy cooled, but they still need more workers than they have now.
But that free fall may be on the horizon. Amazon, Meta and FedEx are freezing some hiring. And a recent poll by KPMG of more than 1,300 chief executives found that nearly 40 percent said they had done the same. “Hiring freezes are the first step before companies move into cost-cutting mode,” Knightley said. Furman said he also thought there was a good chance that a lot of layoffs were coming. “Productivity growth was a record negative in the first half of the year — so companies were not producing much output, but using lots of labor to produce it,” he said. “I’m not sure how sustainable that will be for them.”

China, the decider
Over the past decade, Beijing has been the lender of choice for many governments building bullet trains, hydroelectric dams, airports and superhighways. With global inflation on the rise and economies weakened, China has the power to decide whether to cut countries off, lend more or forgive portions of their debts, writes The Times’s Keith Bradsher.
China’s loans loom large in corners near and far. In Pakistan, overall public debt has more than doubled over the past decade, with loans from China growing fastest; in Kenya, public debt is up ninefold. As Pakistan has struggled to cope with a devastating flood, its loan repayments to China have been rising. Such loans were a hot-button political issue when Kenyans and Angolans went to the polls in presidential elections in August.
The nature of the loans compounds challenges. China issues many loans at adjustable interest rates with repayment in dollars. With rates and the dollar rising quickly, poor nations are struggling to pay off the debt. So far, Beijing’s powerful government ministries have been slow to address the matter.

Global leaders want faster action. “We’re constantly telling China that we want them to come to the table and participate in the Common Framework,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, referring to a plan by the Group of 20 industrialized nations to relieve the debt burdens of dozens of poor countries. In August, Beijing forgave about 0.3 percent of its loans to African countries, focusing on 20-year-old defaulted debts, money that China was very unlikely to get back.
At the same time, Chinese officials based in some poor nations face unpleasant jobs as debt collectors. “You have a lot more influence when you’re providing the loan,” said Brad Setser, an international payments specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations, “than when you’re begging for repayment.”

2022-10-07,"Rivian, the electric-car maker, said on Friday that it was recalling 13,000 vehicles after identifying an issue that could affect drivers’ ability to steer some of its vehicles.
The company said it had found out on Sept. 28 about seven reports that might be related to the safety issue and did not know of any injuries caused by it.
The recall, which covers nearly all vehicles that have been delivered since Rivian began production late last year in Normal, Ill., is due to “an insufficiently torqued fastener,” the company said. The flaw, in rare instances, can impede steering, a company spokesperson said. Noise, vibration and harshness from the front suspension are among the symptoms of the problem.
The issue affects 1 percent of the vehicles, but an inability to control the steering wheel will occur in a much smaller number, the spokesperson said. Rivian sent an email to customers and promised to make repairs for free, planning to do so within 30 days.

“We will begin immediately contacting affected customers to schedule appointments for inspections and repairs if needed,” a company spokesperson said in an email.
Rivian produces the R1T pickup truck, which starts at $73,000, and the R1S sport utility vehicle, which starts at $78,000.
Rivian, which is based in Irvine, Calif., and positioned itself as a Tesla competitor, has lost its luster with investors since it completed its initial public offering last year. The company has struggled to meet production goals because of the computer chip shortage and to fulfill its promise to provide Amazon, one of its biggest investors, with delivery vans. Shares of Rivian are down nearly 67 percent since the beginning of the year."
2022-10-08,"The hijabs that thousands of Iranian women and girls have been burning in defiance over the past few weeks — since the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran’s morality police on Sept. 16 — are a symbol of far broader discontent with Iran’s corrupt and incompetent leaders. The protests since Ms. Amini’s death, led by women, have persisted for weeks and have brought Iranians in dozens of cities into the streets to reveal the depth of their anger. Iranians who are sick and tired of living under a tyrannical theocracy deserve the support of the United States and its allies.
The death of Ms. Amini, who was detained by the guidance patrol for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly, is an outrageous sample of the violence the Islamic Republic has visited on women since coming to power in 1979. The religious cabal that has led Iran since then, currently led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, regards enmity with the United States and keeping women in their place as critical to their survival in power.
The threat of a virulently anti-American and anti-Israeli regime obtaining nuclear weapons is real, but the diplomatic efforts to block it must go hand in hand with efforts to help Iranians who are seeking respite and change.
Ayatollah Khamenei is 83 and ailing, and he is among the last of the Islamic revolutionaries who overthrew the monarchy. His passing, however, would be no guarantee of a more liberal regime in Tehran. As Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote in a recent essay in The Times, his cohort of true believers have been largely supplanted by opportunists in search of wealth and privilege.
Global isolation may be damaging to the regime, but global integration would be dangerous, as Mr. Sadjadpour wrote. The regime might see its best chance of survival in maintaining repressive rule and “just the right amount of isolation.” Ayatollah Khamenei wants to be “neither North Korea nor Dubai. He wants to be able to sell Iran’s oil on the global market without sanctions, but he doesn’t want Iran to be fully integrated in the global system.”

Since Donald Trump ripped up the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, the Biden administration and other nations involved have been trying to revive it. That is a worthy effort, but negotiations for the deal, otherwise known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, are at a standstill over two Iranian conditions in particular that Western negotiators cannot meet: that the International Atomic Energy Agency end investigations into traces of uranium at undeclared sites, and that the United States provide guarantees the deal will not again be killed. It is up to Iran to choose whether to revive the deal, and its decision is not likely to be swayed by American behavior.

What’s Up? (Oct. 2-8)
Twitter Deal Back on the Table
Days before he was supposed to be deposed in court regarding his bid to acquire Twitter, Elon Musk changed course once again. This time, it was to return to his initial proposition: buying Twitter at $54.20 a share. He had been trying for months to back out of the $44 billion deal, accusing Twitter of misleading him about the number of spam accounts on its platform. The dispute was set to be litigated in Delaware Chancery Court this month and promised to be a messy affair for both sides. More than a hundred subpoenas had dragged Silicon Valley’s elite into the litigation, and text messages sent among Mr. Musk and his friends and business associates emerged this month, revealing a clash between the billionaire and Twitter’s leadership. But the tumult is not over. The judge overseeing the case granted a request from Mr. Musk’s lawyers to delay the Delaware trial, giving him three weeks to complete the purchase, and, as with all things Musk, the situation could become more complicated still.
A Resilient but Slowing Job Market
As with August’s jobs report, last week’s numbers captured two seemingly contradictory ideas. On the one hand, the 263,000 jobs that employers added in September show that the labor market remains strong, despite higher borrowing costs. At the same time, that number is down from the 315,000 jobs added the month before, suggesting that there has been some cooling off. The Federal Reserve, which is trying to curb job growth to tame inflation, may see it this way: The job market is slowing but not by enough. Wage growth in September, with average hourly earnings climbing 5 percent, is also likely to encourage the Fed to stay the course in raising interest rates.
A Cut in Oil Production
A group of oil producers, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, on Wednesday announced plans to cut production by two million barrels a day. The cut, which represents about 2 percent of the world’s oil production, countered efforts by the United States and Europe to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine — including by capping the price of Russian oil. Analysts say the large cut by OPEC Plus will push up oil prices, helping Russia offset the steep discounts it has had to give to sell its oil. In response, the Biden administration, which had been pushing for an increase in production to ease gasoline prices, said the president would direct the Energy Department to release 10 million additional barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in November. President Biden said on Thursday that he would also be “looking at alternatives” to oil from OPEC Plus producers.

What’s Next? (Oct. 9-15)
A Boost for Retirees
The cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security will be released on Thursday, and it’s expected to be the largest inflation adjustment in four decades. The jump is likely to be about 8.7 percent, closely tracking the government’s figures for the rate of inflation. More than 70 million Americans on Social Security will benefit from this increase, which is intended to ease the impact of rapidly rising prices. But not every recipient will feel the effects of the COLA equally. The rate of inflation can vary depending on where one lives. It can also affect retirees as a group differently, because they tend to spend more on health care and housing, and less on food and transportation. This has led to some criticism over the use of inflation data that affects workers, and not retirees, for the COLA.

Is Inflation Cooling?
After August’s inflation numbers showed price increases remaining stubbornly high, investors and other Fed watchers will be paying close attention to September’s reading on Thursday. Will inflation begin to show clearer signs of moderation? If so, will it be enough to persuade policymakers at the Fed to consider easing their campaign of aggressively raising interest rates? At the moment, the answers to these questions are not so rosy. Data from recent months suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are still strong: Even as the headline inflation number has begun to tick down, a core measure that strips out volatile food and fuel prices has kept climbing. And that’s the measure the Fed cares about the most. The Fed has also emphasized its intent to continue large rate increases through the end of the year. More of the central bank’s thinking will be shared on Wednesday, when minutes from its last meeting are released.
Are Bank Earnings Slumping?
In the search for hints about the direction of the U.S. economy, banks’ earnings reports may be helpful. On Friday, several of the country’s largest banks — JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup — will release their third-quarter results, which are expected to show revenues slumping as the banks’ clients become more anxious about the future. The glimpse into the health of these institutions comes as stocks on Wall Street have tumbled and merger activity has slowed — trends that have renewed fears of a recession. The banks’ reports will provide more insights into how persistent inflation has affected consumer spending, whether the increases in interest rates have dampened people’s inclination to seek out loans and the extent to which those increases have hurt the mortgage business.

2022-10-10,"From the front yard of her ranch-style home, Pam Lemos peered out on the vast valley of her childhood.
She can still picture the way it looked back in the 1980s — citrus groves blanketing hillsides, dairy farms stretching for acres and horses grazing under a bright blue sky. These days, when she looks toward the horizon, she mainly sees the metal roofs of hulking warehouses.
“Now it’s all industrial,” said Ms. Lemos, 55, who has lived in Colton, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, her entire life. “We are working to change that and starting with these warehouses.”
Ms. Lemos is part of a growing coalition of residents and leaders in Colton and neighboring cities — a logistical hub for the nation — who are increasingly frustrated with the proliferation of warehouses in the region, as well as the side effects of the rapid expansion.
As warehouse construction has ballooned nationwide, residents in communities both rural and urban have pushed back. Neighborhood apps like Nextdoor and Facebook groups have been flooded with complaints over construction. In California, the anger has turned to widespread action.
Several cities in this slice of Southern California, known as the Inland Empire, have passed ordinances in recent months halting new warehouse projects so officials can study the effects of pollution and congestion on residents like Ms. Lemos. Similar local moratoriums have cropped up in New York and New Jersey in recent years, but on a much smaller scale.

2022-10-11,"The Amazon Labor Union has built momentum leading up to an election this week at an 800-person warehouse near Albany, N.Y.
A federal labor official recently endorsed the union’s election victory at a Staten Island warehouse in April, which Amazon has challenged, while workers’ frustrations over pay and safety have created an opportunity to add supporters and pressure the company to bargain.
But the union faces questions about whether it can translate such opportunities into lasting gains. For months after its victory at the 8,000-person warehouse on Staten Island, the union appeared to be out of its depths. It nearly buckled under a crush of international media attention and lost a vote at a second Staten Island warehouse in May.
At times, it has neglected organizing inside the original warehouse, known as JFK8, where high turnover means the union must do constant outreach just to maintain support — to say nothing of expanding. Christian Smalls, the union’s president and a former JFK8 employee, seemed distracted as he traveled widely. There was burnout and infighting in the group, and several core members left or were pushed out.

“It wasn’t clear what goal we should be working towards,” said Cassio Mendoza, a JFK8 worker and the union’s communications director, alluding to the sometimes competing priorities of pushing for a contract and organizing more warehouses.
The election near Albany, to be spread out over four days between Wednesday and Monday in Castleton-on-Hudson, could help determine whether the earlier problems were natural growing pains or a sign of deeper dysfunction.

Amazon has cast doubt on the Amazon Labor Union’s experience and says it doesn’t believe that the union represents workers’ views. The company said it was investing $1 billion over the next year to permanently raise hourly pay.
Among the union’s biggest diversions in recent months was countering Amazon’s attempt to overturn its victory, which consumed time and resources, as supporters and leaders testified in hearings that dragged across 24 business days beginning in mid-June. The union delayed plans to train more workers as organizers. A national organizing call was put on hold.

Just before Labor Day, the National Labor Relations Board official running the hearings recommended rejecting Amazon’s challenge and certifying the union. A regional official must still weigh in.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
The finding appeared to bolster the union within the Staten Island warehouse, though management responded by sending workers a message saying the company intended to appeal. “We believe a direct relationship with you is best,” the message said.
Around the same time, the union began to refocus. It opened an office on Staten Island in late August, hired two full-time staff members and set up a database tracking worker support. “I feel we are in a better place than we have ever been,” Mr. Mendoza said.
The union brought in prominent labor organizers to lead regular in-person training on how to push for a contract. It finally held two calls in an effort to recruit and train leaders for organizing drives nationwide.
“Your building could be next, and that is why we are having this call,” Madeline Wesley, an Amazon employee who is a lead Amazon Labor Union organizer for the second Staten Island warehouse, said on one call. Workers who indicated they were from facilities in Kentucky, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington took part.

The union, which says it has set aside about one-fifth of its more than half-million-dollar budget for expansion, is already backing other organizing campaigns, including the one in Castleton-on-Hudson and another at a warehouse east of Los Angeles. Nannette Plascencia, a self-described “soccer mom” who is the California facility’s lead organizer, met Mr. Smalls at a party in Hollywood and decided that the Amazon Labor Union “understood where we were coming from,” she recalled in an interview.
On Tuesday, the union submitted a petition for an election to represent workers at Ms. Plascencia’s warehouse, according to the N.L.R.B. Officials have yet to verify whether the union demonstrated enough support to warrant an election.

“Check out the Amazon 25-cent raise — we’re not falling for that,” Christian Smalls, the union’s president, said at the barbecue.

In late September, Amazon told workers that it was increasing hourly wages to reflect local market conditions, pledging to raise them by more than $1 in many warehouses. But at JFK8, where pay started at $18.25 an hour, the raise was between 25 cents and 75 cents an hour, depending on level and tenure.

“It’s not enough to buy groceries,” said Celia Camasca, an employee of the warehouse there. “It would be better if they would have said nothing.”

The union emphasized the slim raise at a barbecue outside the warehouse that had been coincidentally planned for an afternoon shortly after workers learned about it. “Check out the Amazon 25-cent raise — we’re not falling for that,” said Mr. Smalls, the union’s president and the event’s M.C.
Union officials circulated a petition demanding that Amazon come to the bargaining table and that it give workers on Staten Island an immediate cost-of-living wage increase. Brandon Wagner, a packer who said that he had worked at the warehouse for about a month and that he previously made $17 an hour at a Wendy’s, signed the petition while waiting in line for food because, he said, workers are underpaid.
Paul Flaningan, an Amazon spokesman, said that the national average pay for most frontline jobs was more than $19 an hour and that the company offered “comprehensive benefits” for full-time employees, including health insurance from Day 1, paid parental leave and 401(k) matching.
The union still faces numerous obstacles. Amazon could spend years appealing the election result on Staten Island, and the company still has enormous power over JFK8 workers. After workers protested Amazon’s response to a fire at the site last week, the company suspended more than 60 of them with pay while, it said, it investigated what had occurred. The union filed unfair-labor-practice charges over the suspensions; Amazon said most of the workers had returned to work.

The voting near Albany presents the union with its most visible immediate test.
In interviews outside the warehouse, which handles oversize items like lawn mowers and televisions, many workers cited safety concerns and said pay was too low given the difficulty of the work. New workers made a base wage of $15.70 an hour before an increase of $1.30 this month.

Some also complained that Amazon was too quick to discipline workers for minor infractions.
David Bornt, who scans in merchandise before placing it in bins, said a misunderstanding over a quota had recently led to his being written up. He argued that a union could ease such stresses.
“It’s someone to have your back,” Mr. Bornt said. “I have four kids, one on the way. I can’t be worried about losing my job at any minute.”
Other employees said they opposed the union because they were satisfied with their pay and benefits and didn’t see how a union could improve the situation.

“There’s just no need for it,” said Anthony Hough, one of those workers. “We just got a raise.”
According to government data, Albany is one of the most unionized metropolitan areas in the country, and many employees expressed positive views about unions. But some said past experience at unionized workplaces made them less eager to join another one. Some also said they distrusted the Amazon Labor Union in particular.
“The A.L.U. is new,” said Jacob Carpenter, another employee. “They’re not giving us any information.”
The election outcome is likely to shape perceptions of the union. Heather Goodall, the lead organizer at the warehouse, is a member of the Amazon Labor Union’s board, and leaders of the union like Connor Spence, its treasurer, have visited the Albany area regularly. Mr. Smalls has traveled there as well.

Ms. Goodall said she was concerned about safety at the warehouse. An Amazon spokesman said the company had a better overall safety record than other retailers.

Ms. Goodall said she joined Amazon in February to help unionize the warehouse because she was concerned about unusually high injury rates, among other safety issues. The facility was evacuated after a cardboard compactor caught fire last week, two days after the JFK8 fire, which was similar.

“The timeline to fix things is before something tragic happens,” Ms. Goodall said.
She accused Amazon of running an aggressive anti-union campaign, including regular meetings with employees in which it questions the union’s credibility and suggests that workers could end up worse off if they unionize.
Mr. Flaningan, the company spokesman, said that while injuries increased as Amazon trained hundreds of thousands of new workers in 2021, the company believed that its safety record surpassed that of other retailers over a broader period.
“Like many other companies, we hold these meetings because it’s important that everyone understands the facts about joining a union and the election process itself,” he said, adding that the decision to unionize is up to employees."

For years, abortion was a straightforward rallying cry for Republicans, a way to identify with the cultural politics of their core supporters in one word: pro-life.
But the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade plunged the party into a complicated reproductive reality, as I reported in this story that published this morning. The decision ended federal abortion rights, essentially forcing each state to legislate its own rules. After decades of fighting for that very outcome, when it finally happened, Republicans had no clear national message or unified policy.
Almost immediately, Republican lawmakers were thrust into messy and emotional debates over some difficult issues: child rape, life-threatening medical complications from pregnancies and the devastating diagnoses of fetuses with rare and fatal conditions. As they debated, Republicans saw a once-easy way to energize their supporters transformed into a new third rail. And Democrats saw their fortunes rise in the midterms.
Will that be enough for Democrats to keep control of Congress? Probably not. But the issue could be a deciding factor in some close races, particularly governors’ contests where the winners may determine abortion rights in their states.
One question, many answers
What do Republicans believe about abortion? It all depends on whom you ask. Abortion is one of the starkest areas of disagreement within the party right now.
In Nevada, Joe Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas area who is running for governor, says he wouldn’t change state law, which currently allows abortion up to 24 weeks of a pregnancy — one of the latest limits in the country.

2022-10-13,"In the late 1940s, the president of Peru, Gen. Manuel Odría, had a bright idea, or so he thought, about the colonization of the Amazon: start with criminals, convicted or not. This penal colony, called Sepa — which began operating in 1951 and was mostly shut down in the early 1990s — was often a dumping ground for political opponents of whatever leadership was in power at the time. Far from so-called civilization and wanting in many resources, it was an environment in which prisoners were obliged to form functioning communities or die.
“Sepa, Nuestro Señor de los Milagros,” a short but crucial documentary made in 1986, depicts life in the colony. Sepa was populated by all manner of criminals, some violent, some not: sex offenders, thieves, small-scale drug traffickers‌. But, partially because the environment compelled the inhabitants to work together, this “green hell,” as an interviewee calls it, was in a sense far more functional than most prisons: There were no gangs, no alcohol or drug abuse, and little violence.
There was, however, a powerful sense of isolation and a good deal of nonchalant corruption. This comes across in sequences showing the ramblings of an amiable prison director at the time, Alfredo Elias, and in visits with a prisoner nicknamed “the colonel,” who hailed from the United States. These scenes are both humorous and a bit terrifying.

The movie was directed by the Swiss filmmaker Walter Saxer, an associate of Werner Herzog, and Saxer’s voice on the soundtrack brings the more famous director to mind. (The narration was written by the Peruvian author and onetime politician Mario Vargas Llosa.) Long considered lost, it’s premiering in New York in a restored version. Seen today, it’s a provocative addition to the literature of incarceration.

2022-10-14,"Two of the country’s largest supermarket chains announced plans on Friday to merge in a deal that could alter the food retail landscape but will also face intense scrutiny by regulators.
Kroger said it would acquire Albertsons for $24.6 billion. The chains currently have total revenue of more than $209 billion and about 5,000 stores across the country under well-known chains like Ralphs, Safeway and Vons.
Executives at the two companies said the combination was needed to better fend off big-box retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Costco, which can use their size to sell yogurt, cereals and pastas at lower prices, and have increasingly taken a bigger share of consumers’ wallets. Moreover, they said, the companies would pass along to customers as much as $500 million in savings resulting from the merger.
But the deal quickly drew criticism from consumer advocates, independent grocery chains and politicians who said it would limit shoppers’ choices of where to buy groceries, especially in lower-income and rural areas, and could lead to higher prices for consumers and independent grocers.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“We don’t need another mega grocery store chain,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group that challenges areas of concentrated corporate power, such as the grocery industry.
If the merger went through, she said, the combined Albertsons-Kroger and Walmart would control 70 percent or more of the market in 167 cities in the United States. In some, like Salina, Kan., or Durango, Colo., the share would exceed 90 percent.
The proposed deal places political pressure on the Biden administration and will face tough regulatory scrutiny at a time when high inflation has compounded a global food security crisis. Food prices in the United States rose more than 11 percent in September from a year earlier.
“Grocery chains like Kroger and Albertsons are price-gouging families with inflated food prices, and further corporate consolidation would result in higher prices, employee layoffs and weaker supply chains,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in an emailed statement. “The F.T.C. should oppose this deal.”
Nearly three decades of consolidation has resulted in far fewer grocery stores in the country. Since the mid-1990s, the number has declined nearly 30 percent, according to a report by Food and Water Watch, a consumer advocacy group. At the same time, the combined market share of the four largest grocery retailers tripled to 69 percent from 23 percent, the group said.

These days, the biggest grocery retailer is Walmart, which generated $218 billion last year from food sales, or 55 percent of its U.S. revenue. Amazon, which acquired Whole Foods in 2017 and sells groceries on its website, is a smaller presence but is pressuring rivals as it reaches further into the industry.
It’s an industry at a pivotal juncture, after revenues and profits soared early in the pandemic as consumers ate most of their meals at home. Now people are eating more meals away from home than they did two years ago, inflation is slicing into store profit margins and some shoppers are shifting to less-expensive stores like Walmart.
In June, Rodney McMullen, the chief executive of Cincinnati-based Kroger, told Wall Street analysts that the chain was seeing a significant shift in behavior among shoppers because of inflation. While some consumers continued to buy premium products, others were “aggressively” switching to store brands, he said.

Still, little of that seems to have harmed the company’s bottom line. In the most recent quarter, which ended Aug. 13, Kroger’s operating profits grew 13.7 percent from a year earlier, allowing it to boost its dividend to investors by 24 percent. It has also repurchased $975 million of its own shares this year.
As part of their pitch to regulators, Kroger and Albertsons are likely to argue that their combined scale is needed to compete against stores like Aldi and Lidl — two European chains that have been expanding quickly in the United States — as well as Walmart, Amazon and Costco.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The Federal Trade Commission has not always been convinced by that argument. In 2015, it successfully sued to block a merger between Office Depot and Staples, even after the retailers had positioned their merger as an effort to take on Amazon and lower prices.

In its review, the F.T.C. is likely to consult with consumer advocates, competitors, suppliers and others. Regulators will also look at whether Kroger promised that past acquisitions would lower prices, and whether those promises came to fruition. The review could take months, keeping the companies and their employees grappling with uncertainty.
Kroger and Albertsons, which is based in Boise, Idaho, said Friday that they expected to close the deal in early 2024, and that Kroger would pay Albertsons $600 million if the merger fell apart over antitrust concerns.
Hoping to stave off concerns about combined market share in various cities, which would be a key hurdle in a review by the F.T.C., the two grocery giants said they planned to sell stores to competitors, and would consider spinning off between 100 and 375 stores into a separate company.
Analysts have pointed to overlap between the two grocers, particularly on the West Coast in cities like Seattle, where they would have a combined 40 percent market share, as a likely source of divestitures.
Lina Khan, who leads the F.T.C., has expressed skepticism that these types of solutions are sufficient to create real competition against the newly formed entity. Peter Kaplan, a spokesman for the FTC, declined to comment.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In fact, some past efforts to form a new competitor haven’t worked. In 2014, the retailer Haggen in Bellingham, Wash., bought more than 100 stores that Albertsons had sold to win approval for its $9 billion merger with Safeway. A year later, Haggen filed for bankruptcy and blamed Albertsons for the breakdown of its business. Albertsons later bought back 33 of those stores from the bankrupt company.
“Part of the rationale for this deal is that ‘We need to be bigger,’” said Bill Baer, who led the Justice Department’s antitrust division during the Obama administration. “Well, if you’re bigger and more significant, what does that mean to the markets where you’re dumping stores for some smaller guy who will not have the purchasing power that you claim you’re going to get from this deal?”
He added, “Divestiture is always a bright idea for merging parties, and it’s not always a very good idea for consumers.”
Consumer advocates said the deal would be bad for consumers and independent grocery chains.
The biggest grocery retailers, like Walmart, use their size to negotiate better pricing from producers and suppliers. Kroger and Albertsons, which many analysts say are already big enough to negotiate good deals, hope to reap even more negotiating power.
But to make up those lost profits, suppliers often charge smaller and independent grocers more, said Chris Jones, counsel and a senior vice president of government relations for the National Grocers Association, which represents 1,700 family-owned grocery chains.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“If you squeeze a supplier on one side and you’re able to get product on preferential terms, the supplier has no choice but to increase prices or short product to buyers that have less leverage,” Mr. Jones said.
The independent chains then have to pass along the higher prices to their customers, who are often in the lower-income, urban and rural markets that the megastores bypass because they’re not profitable enough.
Rebecca Wolf, a food policy analyst at Food & Water Watch, concluded that this proposed merger offered consumers little benefit.
“A lot of advocates and consumer advocates who have been following this kind of work for a long time really know and understand that this type of merger will entrench the power of the grocery industry,” she said."

2022-10-16,"For millions of people who tune in each week, keeping up with HBO’s “House of the Dragon” is a diverting pastime; for Mallory Rubin, it’s more like a professional sport.
Rubin makes two weekly podcasts about “Dragon,” the “Game of Thrones” prequel series. To train, she watches each episode a minimum of three times and then prepares a discussion outline, typically running seven or eight pages, cross-referencing the show with the original books by George R.R. Martin and eight seasons of “Thrones.” (Rubin has watched every episode of “Thrones” more than a dozen times.) Many podcasts live or die by the charisma of the host or co-hosts. But Rubin’s shows — “Talk the Thrones,” an instant reaction show with Chris Ryan and Joanna Robinson, and “House of R,” which offers more detailed analysis, with Robinson — rest equally on her evident mastery of her material.
A self-described “huge nerd,” and the head of editorial for The Ringer, Rubin has an inexhaustible passion for — and near-encyclopedic knowledge of — many of the most popular fictional universes of the last century. She is a former co-host, with Jason Concepcion, of the hit podcast “Binge Mode,” which featured close readings of “Game of Thrones,” the “Star Wars” saga, the Harry Potter books and 25 movies in the Marvel cinematic universe, among other titles.
It would be hard to engineer a commentator better equipped for this moment, when growth-obsessed streaming services and movie studios have coaxed audiences toward the outer limits of franchise entertainment. In addition to the two “House of the Dragon” podcasts, Rubin and Robinson co-hosted one about Amazon’s “The Rings of Power,” based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s appendices to “The Lord of the Rings,” and will begin another about Disney Plus’s “Andor” — the prequel to a prequel of the first “Star Wars” trilogy — later this month.

“I think maybe one day in my life I will arrive at a point where fatigue starts to set in,” said Rubin, 36. “I don’t find that to be a part of my experience, currently.”

Rubin began her career as an editor and blogger for the website of Sports Illustrated (she still covers football and baseball at The Ringer) but found a natural home in podcasts, where many listeners turn for deeper engagement with news and culture. “The Ringer-Verse,” an omnibus feed that houses “Talk the Thrones” and “House of R,” among The Ringer’s other nerd-culture shows, regularly appears at the top of Apple Podcasts’ TV & Film chart. (The company, which is owned by Spotify, doesn’t share listener figures.)
The peak-TV era has wrought a golden age for TV podcasts. (Podcasts are perhaps the only form of media that has expanded more quickly in recent years than television; Spotify now hosts more than 4.4 million podcast titles, up nearly 800 percent from 2019.)
“It’s a trend that has grown steadily in the last few years,” said Todd Cochrane, the chief executive of Blubrry, a podcast hosting and analytics company. “For shows that have huge or rabid fan bases, anything that gives an insider view or analysis seems to be very, very popular.”

Many new shows now launch with their own official podcasts. Fan-led recaps of new series (“House of the Dragon” is the subject of dozens, in addition to an official podcast from HBO) and old ones (“The West Wing,” “The Office,” “Gilmore Girls”) are part book club, part ESPN postgame show, attracting listeners who want to relive or extend the pleasure of being absorbed by a beloved story.
“Not everyone is going to be obsessed with the same show that you’re obsessed with, at the same time that you’re obsessed with it,” said Josh Wigler, a co-founder of PostShowRecaps, which publishes more than a dozen TV podcasts. “With a recap show, you get to pull up a chair and hear people talk about the thing you can’t wait to talk about.”

In a pair of video interviews from her home office in Los Angeles, Rubin, who has a broadcaster’s perpetually caffeinated temperament, was framed by assorted tokens from a life of fandom. A Grogu figurine from “The Mandalorian,” a replica of Thor’s hammer and a plush doll of Ghost — Jon Snow’s direwolf on “Game of Thrones” — sat atop a bookshelf lined with Marvel comics. Among her most prized possessions are life-size reproductions of Obi-Wan Kenobi’s lightsaber and Jon Snow’s sword.
“I have a bizarre amount of what I can only describe as weaponry,” she said.

Rubin’s love of fantasy fiction began with another bookshelf, in her childhood bedroom in Reisterstown, Md., a suburb of Baltimore. Her father, an environmental policy consultant, filled it with books he hoped they’d enjoy together, including Tolkien’s “The Hobbit.” After inhaling the “Lord of the Rings” series, she later turned to “Star Wars” movies, “Dune” and Harry Potter. The stories became a point of connection for the family — her mother is a former elementary school principal, and she has an older sister with autism — after her parents’ divorce.
In high school, Rubin developed a serious interest in major league baseball and discovered a knack for facts and statistics. Other fans were impressed by her ability to recall the specific grips used by pitchers, or describe the preferred strategies of the 1970s Orioles manager Earl Weaver. In college in the late 2000s, she recognized a similar analytical impulse at the height of Potter-mania. Rubin spent hours researching theories on the online forums MuggleNet and The Leaky Cauldron. As a journalism major and an aspiring baseball writer, she felt she was already chasing one improbable dream; the idea that her love of pop culture would be central to her career was beyond her imagination.

Rubin’s twin passions first merged at the sports and pop culture website Grantland, which she joined as an editor in 2013. Bill Simmons, who hired Rubin at Grantland and later brought her to The Ringer when he started it in 2016, said he had been impressed by her work ethic and enthusiasm.
“When it came to the worlds that we wanted to cover, she was a 10 out of 10,” Simmons said. “She takes this stuff really seriously, which is something that I noticed and that I think the audience notices, too.”
Joanna Robinson, Rubin’s co-host on “Talk the Thrones” and “House of R,” said Rubin’s polyglot cultural fluency is a secret weapon in recording sessions. “You’ll be talking to her, and some perfectly relevant, massive quote from Harry Potter, or ‘Star Wars’ or ‘Lord of the Rings’ will just tumble out of her mouth, verbatim,” she said. “I’m like, ‘Do you have the entire series memorized? How is this possible?’’’
Rubin’s first experience in recap podcasting was covering “Lost” in 2010, during weekly segments of a college football podcast hosted by Stewart Mandel for Sports Illustrated. She was an admirer of the writer Jeff Jensen’s meticulous recap blogs for Entertainment Weekly and listened to “The Official Lost Podcast” — one of the first official recap podcasts — hosted by the showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. Like many fans, Rubin came to view the experience of deconstructing the show with fellow obsessives as equally meaningful to sitting down for an hour in front of her television once a week.
“I basically had no room in my life for anyone who wanted to talk about anything other than ‘Lost,’” Rubin said.

Kristin Russo, a queer activist who was the co-creator, with the musician Jenny Owen Youngs, of the “Buffering the Vampire Slayer” podcast, about “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” said shows with a cult following are “a magical vehicle for forging community.” “Buffering,” which recently ended after a six-year run, attracted around 180,000 listeners per month, many of whom also attended live “Buffering” events or contributed between $2 and $10 each month to the “Buffering” Patreon account.

“We had fans who met their spouses on the old “Buffy” message boards, or who grew up with the show and listened with their children, who were watching for the first time,” said Youngs. “It was like getting to be a part of a kind of family.” (Russo and Youngs are planning a new show about “The X-Files.”)
Since September, when “The Rings of Power” premiered, two weeks after the premiere of “House of the Dragon,” Rubin’s weeks have been divided roughly in half. She typically receives screeners for “Dragon” on Wednesdays, records “Talk the Thrones” on Fridays and tapes a “deep dive” into each episode for “House of R” on Tuesday mornings. Until last week, when “Rings of Power” ended its first season, she received “Rings of Power” screeners on Tuesday afternoons and podcasted about the show on Thursdays. Although she doesn’t officially work weekends, Rubin described Saturday as “an ideal prep day” for her recording sessions the following week.
“We’re a couple of Hermiones set loose on a TV show,” said Robinson.
Rubin said that she recognizes her favorites aren’t for everyone, and that not all heroes’ journeys are created equal. She has no expectation that every listener will find as much joy in fantasy fiction’s ever-expanding cultural footprint as she does. But if and when they do hit the play button — as the genre’s persistent popularity suggests they will — she and her colleagues will be ready and waiting.
“One thing I love about these stories is they’re always there to be discovered and rediscovered,” Rubin said, paraphrasing a quote from the first “Game of Thrones” novel. “The words are fixed, but perspectives change.”"

With more than 10 million jobs in the United States unfilled as of August, this is about as good as it gets for workers’ leverage. But it still isn’t very good. For most Americans, particularly those earning less than the median income, employers continue to control when, where and how they work, in some cases right down to their bathroom breaks.
“When we are workers, we lie under the government of a boss. It’s a dictatorship. The boss rules,” Elizabeth Anderson, a professor of philosophy and women’s studies at the University of Michigan, told me last week. She wrote a 2017 book on the topic, “Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (And Why We Don’t Talk About It).”
Despite the obvious dominance of employers, though, a lot of economic research and legal scholarship is based on the libertarian notion that employers and employees have relatively equal bargaining power and are thus “free to contract” with one another as truly independent parties.
The assumption of roughly equal power is not just silly, it’s harmful. Take the Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in Epic Systems Corporation v. Lewis, which upheld the validity of contracts in which employees surrender the right to collective litigation against their employers. Underlying the decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, was the implicit assumption that when workers give up that important right, it’s their free choice.
But as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a dissent, free choice in this situation is an illusion. “Forced to face their employers without company, employees ordinarily are no match for the enterprise that hires them,” she wrote. She likened the Epic Systems contract to yellow-dog contracts of the 1930s, which prohibited new hires from joining unions as a condition of employment. Take it or leave it.
A recent special issue of The Journal of Law and Political Economy casts a jaundiced eye on the convenient fiction that employment contracts reflect the free choices of employees. The issue was conceived and edited by Lawrence Mishel, the former president of the Economic Policy Institute.

2022-10-18,"Workers at an Amazon facility near Albany, N.Y., have voted decisively against being represented by the upstart Amazon Labor Union, denting efforts to expand unionization across the giant e-commerce company.
Employees at the warehouse cast 206 votes to be represented by the union and 406 against, according to a count released on Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board. Almost 950 workers were eligible to vote.
The vote was the Amazon Labor Union’s second unsuccessful election since a surprise victory in April, when workers at an Amazon facility on Staten Island voted to form the first union of the company’s warehouse employees in the United States.
“We’re glad that our team in Albany was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep the direct relationship with Amazon,” Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT

In recent months, the Amazon Labor Union has debated whether to focus on winning a contract at the Staten Island facility, known as JFK8, or on expanding its reach to other warehouses around the country through additional elections.
Christian Smalls, the union’s president, “is very much in favor of trying to create opportunities for as many workers as possible to vote,” said Cassio Mendoza, a JFK8 worker and the union’s communications director. At the same time, the union has felt pressure to demonstrate progress to workers on Staten Island, and has recently stepped up its internal organizing there after months of minimal public activity.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
The result on Tuesday from the ALB1 warehouse in Castleton-on-Hudson, N.Y., about 10 miles south of Albany, did not appear to dissuade the union from reaching beyond JFK8.
“We are filled with resolve to continue and expand our campaign for fair treatment for all Amazon workers,” Mr. Smalls said in a statement. “You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take.”
About 80 percent of the union’s budget of more than half a million dollars has been focused on Staten Island, union officials have said. The rest has been set aside for expansion efforts, including at ALB1 and a facility in Southern California that submitted a petition for an election last week.

Mr. Smalls said the election “wasn’t free and fair.” Even before the ballots were tallied on Tuesday, the union expressed concern that Amazon had improperly interfered with the vote, potentially laying the groundwork for a legal objection to the result.
Labor board staff members have been investigating 27 charges of unfair labor practices that the union filed against Amazon before the voting began, the agency said last week. The union has since lodged additional concerns.
One included an accusation that a worker had been suspended for complaining that one of Amazon’s anti-union consultants followed him around and harassed him during the voting period, according to Retu Singla, a lawyer representing the union.
“They try to whip votes during the election,” said Mr. Mendoza, who added that the consultant appeared to be wearing worker clothes and an Amazon vest.
Another employee, who was not directly involved with the union campaign and requested anonymity, said on the first day of voting that he had seen what appeared to be “fake employees” who were wearing Amazon vests but did not know the basics of the jobs and cast doubt on the union’s ability to negotiate a contract.

Matthew Bodie, a former N.L.R.B. lawyer now at the University of Minnesota Law School, said that while one-on-one conversations with workers during the voting period were allowed, seeking to deceive employees by misrepresenting the identity of company agents could amount to interference in the election.
Amazon declined to comment on the accusations.
The ALB1 warehouse handles oversize items like outdoor equipment and televisions. A recent report by a worker advocacy group found that the facility had the highest rate of serious injuries of any Amazon warehouse in New York for which the group was able to obtain government data.
Amazon has emphasized its minimum starting wage and benefits, and has said it has improved its safety record more than other retailers in recent years. In its messaging to workers, it has questioned the Amazon Labor Union’s experience and has said workers could be worse off if they voted for a union.
In interviews outside the warehouse in September, some Amazon workers said they were supporting the union because pay was too low, especially in light of how physically taxing the work could be. The company recently raised its starting base wage at the warehouse to $17 an hour, from $15.70.
“I think we need a union — we need more pay,” said Masud Abdullah, an employee at the warehouse. He said he had made about $22 an hour at an industrial bakery, but left that job because the hours did not fit with his parenting responsibilities.

He and other workers also said they felt Amazon’s disciplinary policies were sometimes arbitrary. “It’s like you don’t have nobody representing you,” Mr. Abdullah said. “They could get you in and out for anything.”
Other workers said they didn’t believe a union was necessary because Amazon already provided solid pay and benefits, such as health care and college tuition subsidies. Even some union supporters acknowledged that the company often treated workers well.
Some workers expressed skepticism that the Amazon Labor Union would deliver on its promises, such as improving pay. “I feel like I haven’t seen any evidence,” said Jacob Carpenter, who works at the warehouse. He added that he planned to vote no.
Amazon has been fighting the union’s successful vote on Staten Island. After a lengthy hearing on the company’s objections to that election, a labor board official recently endorsed the union’s victory. A regional official must still weigh in, but Amazon told workers at JFK8 that it intended to appeal. The union has recently pushed a petition to pressure Amazon to negotiate a contract."

Stream it on Netflix.
Boasting the endorsements of Mindy Kaling (an executive producer) and Ava DuVernay (whose company, Array, distributed), this tender but tough comedy-drama marks the arrival of a major new talent. Sujata Day writes, directs and stars as Monica, who won the Scripps National Spelling Bee at 8 years old; now she’s in her mid-20s and increasingly feeling that she’ll never top that achievement. What begins as a fairly formulaic coming-of-age tale takes a surprisingly moving turn to the serious as Day focuses on Monica’s tempestuous relationship with her estranged brother (Ritesh Rajan), and while the results are a little uneven, she carefully (thankfully) avoids easy answers and pat solutions. It’s a deeply felt and personal film, and Day (who appeared on several episodes of “Insecure”) is a warm and likable screen presence.
‘Petite Maman’ (2022)
Stream it on Hulu.
Céline Sciamma, the writer and director of the heart-wrenching epic “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” follows up with a film far smaller in scope but just as emotionally devastating. Joséphine Sanz stars as Nelly, an independent and charming 8-year-old who is left to entertain herself as her parents pack up the remote home of her recently deceased grandmother. Wandering in the nearby woods, she befriends another young girl (played by Joséphine’s real-life twin sister, Gabrielle Sanz), and as they play together. … Actually, to reveal more than that is to rob this affecting story of its delicate power. It’s a short but spellbinding work from one of our master filmmakers.

‘Cyrus’ (2010)

The prolific Duplass brothers made their first play for mainstream plaudits with this low-budget (but high for them!) story of a regular guy (John C. Reilly) who finds his burgeoning relationship with the woman of his dreams (Marisa Tomei) stifled by the interference of her overbearing, attention-starved adult son (Jonah Hill). It’s the kind of setup that one might imagine in a broad, gross-out comedy (like the Reilly-fronted “Step Brothers,” for example), but the Duplasses use their background in character-driven indies to keep the narrative anchored in a welcome emotional truth.
‘Dirty Weekend’ (2015)

“This turned out to be one crazy layover,” Les (Matthew Broderick) says to his co-worker Natalie (Alice Eve), and it’s a bit of an understatement. During an unexpected stop in Albuquerque, he wanders downtown, in search of … well, he’s got a secret, and over the course of Neil LaBute’s low-key drama, he decides to explore and interpret that secret, with his colleague’s help. LaBute attempts neither the emotional brutality of his signature films (“In the Company of Men,” “Your Friends and Neighbors”), nor the milder approach of his more mainstream works, choosing instead to carefully dig into areas you can easily imagine him exploding. Broderick finds a unique take on the style and dialogue, Eve proves again (after “Some Velvet Morning”) that she’s an ideal LaBute leading lady, and you certainly don’t know where this weekend is heading next.

‘Grand Piano’ (2014)
Stream it on HBO Max.
Playing a solo piano concerto, in your first concert in years, is nerve-racking enough; now imagine opening your score and finding the promise that you’ll pay for a single false note with your life. This is the ingenious, “Speed”-meets-Hitchcock premise of this early screenplay by Damien Chazelle (“La La Land”). Played too serious and it’s silly; played too broadly and there are no stakes. But both Elijah Wood (as the pianist) and John Cusack (as the sniper stalking him) find the right balance of preposterousness and pulp, and Eugenio Mira directs with boisterous verve.

Hulu recently added a number of Pedro Almodóvar’s best films — including “All About My Mother,” “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “Volver” and “Broken Embraces” — but this, a witty dip into the waters of sci-fi and body horror, is seldom placed in the same company. Yet it’s a fascinating experiment, fusing Almodóvar’s usual obsessions with genre tropes in entertaining and unnerving fashion, and it features one of the darkest turns to date from Antonio Banderas, his frequent collaborator and avatar. Banderas is a wealthy plastic surgeon who reveals himself, over the course of the twisty, labyrinthine narrative, as something closer to a mad scientist; Vera (the haunting Elena Anaya) is his “monster,” and his obsession.
‘Iron Fists and Kung Fu Kicks’ (2019)
Stream it on Netflix.
Serge Ou’s crackerjack documentary is a fast-paced but thorough exploration of martial arts cinema, from the roots of the genre in Hong Kong and the origins of its superstars to its crossover (and mutations) to America in the 1970s and beyond. “Iron Fists” is also deeply steeped in both movie and world history, as demonstrated by interviews with key figures (Sammo Hung, Don Wilson, Cynthia Rothrock) and experts in the field (including the historian Grady Hendrix). It’s a film about both production and viewership, and it delves into the movements in politics and culture that made these films so popular. The clips are a blast and the editing is breathless, capturing the relentless energy and gonzo spirit of the best kung fu flicks.
‘Running with Beto’ (2019)
Stream it on HBO Max.
With Beto O’Rourke making a hotly contested run for the Texas governor’s office, it’s a fine time to check out the director David Modigliani’s portrait of O’Rourke’s breakthrough grass-roots U.S. Senate campaign, in which he visited all 254 counties in the deep-red state and nearly unseated the incumbent, Ted Cruz. That “nearly” is the movie’s hitch — after following all of the story beats of underdog victory, you feel the filmmakers straining to give the movie the happy ending it so desperately needs. But this is an energetic and entertaining on-the-trail documentary, run through with funny side characters and fascinating glimpses into what it takes to run a contemporary campaign."
2022-10-20,"The Texas attorney general filed a privacy lawsuit against Google on Thursday, accusing the internet company of collecting Texans’ facial and voice recognition information without their explicit consent.
Ken Paxton, the state’s attorney general, said Google had violated a state consumer protection law that requires companies to inform citizens and get their consent before capturing their biometric identifiers, including fingerprints, voiceprints and a “record of hand or face geometry.”
Violators of the law face fines of up to $25,000 per violation. Mr. Paxton said Google had millions of users in Texas who were potentially affected.
“Google’s indiscriminate collection of the personal information of Texans, including very sensitive information like biometric identifiers, will not be tolerated,” Mr. Paxton said in a statement. “I will continue to fight Big Tech to ensure the privacy and security of all Texans.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
José Castañeda, a Google spokesman, said in a statement that Mr. Paxton “is once again mischaracterizing our products in another breathless lawsuit.” He added, “We will set the record straight in court.”
The complaint targets the Google Photos app, which allows people to search for photos they took of a particular person; Google’s Nest camera, which can send alerts when it recognizes (or fails to recognize) a visitor at the door; and the voice-activated Google Assistant, which can learn to recognize up to six users’ voices to give them personalized answers to their questions. Mr. Paxton said the products violated the rights of both users and nonusers, whose faces and voices were scanned or processed without their understanding or consent.
Mr. Paxton, who became attorney general in 2015, has repeatedly taken on Big Tech companies in recent years. In 2020, his office, joined by nine other states, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google. After the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Paxton sent investigative demands to Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, asking for details of their content moderation practices. This year, he opened an investigation into Twitter over fake accounts.
Texas introduced its biometric privacy law in 2009, with Illinois and Washington passing similar laws around the same time. While Illinois’s version of the law allows individuals to sue companies directly, Texas must sue companies on consumers’ behalf. Until this year, Texas had not enforced its law.
In contrast, hundreds of class-action lawsuits have been filed over biometric privacy in Illinois, including one against Google in 2016, which recently ended in a $100 million settlement.

“The single biggest difference is that Illinois has a private right of action, which Texas doesn’t,” said Omer Tene, a privacy lawyer at the firm Goodwin. “When it comes to attorney general priorities, this hasn’t figured high. Maybe it’s going to become more central now.”
Mr. Paxton filed the first lawsuit invoking the Texas biometric privacy law in February, suing Meta, which owns Facebook, for facial recognition that it performed on photos to make it easier for users to tag people they knew. The timing seemed odd since Meta had discontinued its decade-long use of facial recognition for photo-tagging on Facebook, and announced plans to delete the associated face scan data, months before it was sued.
At the time, Mr. Paxton was in the final months of a competitive race against George P. Bush for the Republican nomination for attorney general, an elected office in Texas. Mr. Paxton won the primary.
The lawsuit against Meta is continuing. It has already had one effect for Texan consumers: They must now give Meta-owned Instagram permission to analyze their facial features to use certain face filters that can transform their appearance into, for example, a puppy or a googly-eyed monster.
The legal complaint against Google was also filed in the run-up to an election. Mr. Paxton will face a Democratic challenger, Rochelle Garza, in the general election next month.

“Google has now spent years unlawfully capturing the faces and voices of both nonconsenting users and nonusers throughout Texas — including our children and grandparents, who simply have no idea that their biometric information is being mined for profit by a global corporation,” read the complaint against Google, which was filed in district court in Midland County."
2022-10-21,"‘Natchathiram Nagargiradhu’
Stream it on Netflix.
After a series of action blockbusters that effortlessly blend politics with swaggering style (see “Kaala” and “Sarpatta Parambarai,” streaming on Amazon), the visionary Tamil filmmaker Pa. Ranjith has returned with an altogether different genre of film: a talky, postmodern romantic comedy about a troupe of diverse Indian youngsters putting on a play. Yet, if “Natchathiram Nagargiradhu” is more modest in scope than Ranjith’s recent masala epics, the stakes are no lower. As the group decides to stage a production about “honor killings” — filicides of lovers who dare cross caste and religious lines — creative differences become political battles, and romantic tiffs become ideological impasses.
At the heart of this eye-popping, neon-lit film is Rene (Dushara Vijayan), a magnetic, strong-willed actress who wears her Dalit (the so-called untouchable caste) identity proudly on her sleeve. Around her swirl a bevy of equally complex, serrated characters, including her boyfriend, Iniyan, a cosmopolitan liberal who nevertheless lets a slur slip in the middle of a heated argument; the crude, macho newbie Arjun, who undergoes a reckoning as his bigotries are challenged; and the queer couple Diana and Praveen, who wrestle with loving openly in defiance of their parents. Audaciously intercutting scenes of performance and the characters’ personal lives, Ranjith crafts a drama that pulsates with rage, humor, grief and magic, while daringly interrogating the very possibility of making political art.
‘Song Lang’
Stream it on Tubi.
The Saigon of the 1990s comes vividly alive in this swooning period drama by Leon Le, which collides the glamorous world of cai luong, or Vietnamese folk opera, with the grimy underworld of the mafia. Dung (Lien Binh Phat), a debt collector for a loan shark, wears his stoicism like emotional armor as he goes around raiding poor and destitute borrowers. One night, when he’s dispatched to the opera for a raid, his steely shield cracks open. Memories of his childhood as the son of cai luong performers — and his mother’s eventual abandonment of the family — come flooding back.

That fateful night intersects Dung’s path with that of Linh Phung (Isaac), the handsome male lead at the opera, who is tight-lipped with his own secrets. Unfolding over the span of just a few days, “Song Lang” renders the two men’s brief encounter, heavy with unspoken longing and connection, against a lambent backdrop of golden-green light and swirling dust. The film delicately captures the flickers of possibility Dung and Linh Phung kindle in each other before crescendoing to an unexpected final act interwoven with a thrilling cai luong performance.
‘The Last City’
Stream it on Film Movement Plus.
After two decades of making erudite, observational documentaries about urban landscapes and monuments, the German filmmaker Heinz Emigholz has turned, in a spate of recent fiction(ish) films, to a different kind of architecture — that of the mind, or maybe the universe, depending on your vantage point. Of these, “The Last City” is perhaps the most ambitious. Combining the mannered affect of a sitcom and the brazen intimacy of a therapy session, the film unfolds as a series of dialogues between pairs of outlandish interlocutors in five world cities. In Athens, an old white artist and his younger (and inexplicably Asian) self swap notes on mortality and regret. In a church in Berlin, a priest and his brother, a policeman, discuss their incestuous relationship. In Hong Kong, a Chinese woman and her Japanese friend debate war crimes. Shot through with looping rhetorical jokes and sight gags that play on the absurdities of the urban environment, the film seeks answers for thorny moral questions in the startling clarity only afforded by dreams.

‘La Afinadora de Árboles’
Stream it on HBO Max.
In the opening scenes of this Argentine drama, Clara (Paola Barrientos), a successful illustrator and author of children’s books, sits on the toilet of a hotel room in Mexico, refusing to attend the function she has flown into the city for: a ceremony where she will be awarded a prestigious literary prize. She is exhausted and feels like a “parrot,” she tells her husband, who eventually manages to coax her out. Clara has hit some kind of a block, though it’s unclear even to her what precisely is the problem. Soon, she moves with her husband and two kids to a beautiful mansion in the suburbs where she grew up. But rather than provide clarity, the move intensifies her restlessness, especially as characters from her past — including a couple of old flames — reappear.
On paper, “La Afinadora de Árboles” might seem like your run-of-the-mill midlife-crisis drama, but Natalia Smirnoff’s film is about a particular kind of crisis rarely seen onscreen: the creative struggles of a female artist. What Clara is seeking is inspiration, and that quest is invariably messy, blurring personal and professional boundaries with a chaotic intensity that women are rarely allowed. Avoiding predictable narrative beats or sensational twists, “La Afinadora de Árboles” follows Clara without judgment or cynicism as she sketches, stumbles, cries, laughs and slowly feels her way out into the light.
‘Window Boy Would Also Like to Have a Submarine’
Stream it on Mubi.
The early scenes of this debut feature by the Uruguayan filmmaker Alex Piperno are rife with delightful red herrings. In a remote Filipino village, several farmers discover that a large gray shed has appeared overnight on a nearby hill, à la the monolith in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Soon after, in an unspecified city, we see a man on the balcony of a woman’s apartment. He peers in creepily as she eats dinner alone in the living room, priming us for some gruesome action. Neither of these setups unfolds as one would expect, however. Piperno’s film is a stranger, more mysterious creature, a magical-realist fable told in a deadpan style. As we soon learn — through quiet, observant scenes rather than any dialogue or exposition — the Peeping Tom is a young worker on a cruise ship who has chanced upon a portal in the boat’s depths that opens into the woman’s apartment. He’s bored at his job, and the apartment is his little escape. At the same time, the Filipino villagers worry that the shed is a curse of some sort, and try various rituals and sacrifices to make it disappear. Piperno ties together these three settings — the village, the ship and the apartment — with an eye for how perspective can shape space, gesturing toward the mysterious interconnectedness of our fragmented world."

What’s Up? (Oct. 16-22)
Uncertainty in Britain
Investors did not have a strong reaction on Thursday to Liz Truss’s announcement of her resignation as British prime minister. The pound edged only slightly higher, and bond yields briefly fell, then reversed course. It was, perhaps, an anticlimactic conclusion to Ms. Truss’s six weeks in office, which were marked by big market swings in response to her corporate tax cut proposals — plans she later reversed in the face of overwhelming backlash. But her exit doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the tumult. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that despite the central bank’s brief interventions to soothe markets, it will continue to raise interest rates to tame inflation. At the end of the month, Jeremy Hunt, the new finance minister, is set to present the government’s fiscal statement, which he said would include “difficult” spending cuts. And sometime before then, the Conservative Party will appoint a new prime minister, who may have different ideas about taxes and government spending.
Inflation Tightens Its Grip
Two of the world’s largest consumer-facing companies are seeing signs that Americans may be tightening their purse strings. Last week, Nestlé and Procter & Gamble reported higher sales in the third quarter even as they increased the costs of their products by 9 percent or more to keep up with more expensive raw materials, labor and transportation. But the two consumer giants said they sold fewer goods as customers cut back on buying cereal, yogurt, detergent and other items. Other companies have observed a similar trend: This month, PepsiCo said its third-quarter revenue rose 9 percent from a year earlier and that profit grew by more than 20 percent as consumers followed the company “to higher price points.” But its sales volumes also fell. Expected earnings reports from Coca-Cola and Chipotle will give more of an idea of how widespread that tendency is.
An Appetite for Air Travel
Americans eager to get away after delaying vacations earlier in the pandemic are taking advantage of the flexibility of remote work and combining business and leisure travel. And that is boosting airlines’ profits even as high inflation and volatile markets threaten the business. Customers’ appetite for air travel after Labor Day largely kept pace with the boom over the summer, and executives at the country’s major airlines were optimistic as they discussed their third-quarter earnings reports last week. The chief executive of American Airlines, Robert Isom, said the company was feeling “very bullish about overall demand, even in an uncertain economic environment.”  But high demand, while good for airlines’ bottom lines, translates to higher fares for travelers, who may get sticker shock as they book holiday flights.

What’s Next? (Oct. 23-29)
A Tech Slowdown
The country’s biggest tech companies are expected to tell a discouraging story about the direction of the economy with their third-quarter earnings reports this week. Perhaps you were already bracing yourself: Last month, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would freeze most hiring and cut budgets. Shortly after, Amazon said it would freeze corporate hiring in its retail business for the rest of the year, and last week, Snap reported its slowest-ever quarterly growth, noting the “volatile macroeconomic environment.” Once relatively resistant to economic swings, tech companies are increasingly feeling the pinch of inflation and cooling demand. (Apple may be one notable exception, with Wall Street analysts predicting earnings higher than the same period last year.) These factors are compounding other challenges like the strong dollar, which is hurting some companies’ business overseas, and changes to privacy policies that have affected advertising.

A Growing Economy?
The U.S. economy shrank in the last two quarters, meeting one conventional definition of a recession. But most economists use a broader array of indicators, and some — like month after month of strong job reports —  point to an overall economy that is not in a recession. Analysts expect the report on third-quarter gross domestic product, which will be released on Thursday, to show that the economy grew 1.7 percent. On its face, that return to growth could be taken as another sign of a healthy economy. But there may be more troubling signs in the details of the report, economists say, such as weak consumer spending and a slowing housing market that are dragging on the economy.
A Deadline for the Twitter Deal
A sense of unease is rippling through Twitter as the company and its employees prepare for Elon Musk to take it private. The deadline to close the $44 billion deal is Friday, and despite the twists and turns of the acquisition, Mr. Musk appears on track to meet it, with banks finalizing their financial commitments. But already there have been reports about mass layoffs and worries over changes to compensation once Mr. Musk steps in. In a memo to employees last Thursday, Twitter’s general counsel, Sean Edgett, said there was no confirmation of staff cuts and cautioned employees to wait to hear from Mr. Musk himself. Either way, the billionaire is likely to run Twitter on a tight budget, since he is on the hook for the more than $12 billion in loans he took out to finance the acquisition as well the roughly $7 billion he received from Silicon Valley investors, who will eventually be looking for returns.
What Else?
Kanye West is posed to acquire Parler, a social media site known for its right-wing audience. Instacart, the food delivery company, is reversing its plans to go public this year. The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a point on Thursday."

Meet Britain’s (likely) new leader
After weeks of turmoil, British politics appears headed for some stability, as Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor of the Exchequer, is poised to succeed the ill-fated Liz Truss as prime minister. The British pound and government bonds rose a bit on the news — but the economic problems that trouble the country aren’t likely to be cured quickly.
Sunak has the numbers, with over 164 Conservative Party lawmakers backing him for prime minister as of Monday. (Conservative Party rules require candidates to have at least 100 pledged supporters to be considered.) The only remaining challenger, Penny Mordaunt, trails with roughly 90 pledged supporters, she says. But the clock is ticking. She has until 2 p.m. London time on Monday to reach the needed support threshold.
Sunak’s most potent challenger was Boris Johnson, the former prime minister who was ousted after his own cabinet ministers — including Sunak, then chancellor — quit in protest over a series of scandals. Johnson pulled out of the race on Sunday, despite claiming to have the support of 102 lawmakers (with the BBC estimating he had just 57 public backers).
Investors expect relative predictability from a Sunak government. During the race for prime minister this summer, Sunak defended his plans for higher taxes as fiscally responsible, compared with Truss’s promises of tax cuts to spur economic growth. The markets’ virulent reaction to Truss’s plans, which led to sweeping efforts by the Bank of England to prop up the government bonds known as gilts, suggest investors favor a less revolutionary approach, like what Sunak has promised.

Investors appear particularly relieved that Johnson — a notably divisive figure in Britain and abroad, who still faces a parliamentary inquiry into whether he lied to lawmakers about breaking Covid lockdown rules — is out of the running.
But Britain still faces enormous challenges. The Bank of England remains likely to raise interest rates to tamp down inflation that has reached 10 percent; Britain is still facing a huge cost-of-living crisis, owing largely to soaring energy costs; and homeowners face significantly higher mortgage payments. On Friday, Moody’s downgraded Britain’s credit rating outlook to “negative” from “stable,” citing weak growth and “unpredictability” in policymaking.
Sunak must also corral a Conservative Party that has splintered into several warring factions. Hard-right lawmakers favor cracking down on immigration and taking a hard line against the E.U. over the checking of goods crossing the trade border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. He may also face rebellion from Johnson loyalists who blame him for the downfall of the former prime minister.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Tesla cuts prices for key models in China. The electric carmaker has reduced the baseline prices for the Model 3 and the Model Y by as much as 9 percent, Reuters reports. The move appears to be tied to slowing demand in China, the world’s biggest E.V. market, and growing competition from domestic rivals.

The Trump family business goes on trial on Monday. The Manhattan district attorney’s office has accused the Trump Organization of tax fraud and other crimes, focusing on undeclared perks for executives. Among the star witnesses of the trial will be Allen Weisselberg, the company’s former C.F.O.
Japan struggles to prop up the yen. The currency continued to slide against the dollar on Monday, despite what investors suspect was another intervention by the Bank of Japan to curb volatility. Japan is in a difficult bind because it is trying to maintain ultralow interest rates, which could bolster the yen, to spur economic growth.
Chip makers forced to adjust to tighter U.S. restrictions on China. YMTC of China has reportedly asked American employees in key roles to leave, to comply with new rules from Washington that require U.S. citizens to get permission to work at Chinese fabrication plants. And TSMC of Taiwan is said to have stopped work for a burgeoning Chinese semiconductor start-up.
Brace for a potential “tripledemic” this year. With pandemic lockdowns mostly in the past, experts predict a resurgence in Covid cases this winter — along with more traditional outbreaks of flu and, perhaps, of respiratory syncytial virus. “It’s going to be a rough winter,” one infectious disease specialist told The Times.

An “even more dominant” Xi
China released third-quarter economic data on Monday, laying bare the deep challenges facing the country days after Xi Jinping was appointed to an unprecedented third term as leader.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Gross domestic product in the world’s second-biggest economy grew 3.9 percent compared to the same period last year. That is higher than expected, but short of the full-year target of 5.5 percent — China’s lowest annual target in three decades. The authorities unexpectedly delayed publication of the data last week.
Financial markets tumbled. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed down more than 6 percent at a 14-year low on Monday, reflecting anxieties about the worsening economy, and after Xi stacked Communist Party leadership positions with loyalists. Chinese tech stocks listed in the U.S. are the worst performers there premarket, led by the e-commerce companies Pinduoduo and JD.com.
Xi’s move to tighten control was widely expected, but it underscores his ambition to accelerate China’s rise as a military and technological superpower, despite the potential economic damage, write The Times reports. That could have big implications for business.
“He was dominant already and is even more dominant now,” Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said of Xi. A newly energized Beijing is likely to remain defiant in the face of international criticism of its hard-line behavior. It still wants to become the pre-eminent military force in the region and to assert its claim over Taiwan. At the congress, Xi said China would promote its own initiatives to solve global development and security problems.

Unchecked power could slow economic growth. Xi’s exceptionally stringent approach of imposing mass lockdowns and quarantines to eradicate Covid-19 outbreaks has throttled consumer spending and hit supply chains. The hugely important property market is also in a slump after he sought to curb speculation in the sector.
The geopolitical divide between the U.S. and China is widening. President Biden has waged a crackdown on China’s access to U.S. technology — in particular, chips and chip production — and the threat of Russia-like economic sanctions looms. Some of the Western world’s biggest corporations are now evaluating how to reduce the business they do in China. Goldman Sachs, though, hasn’t closed the door. On Monday, it announced a joint venture in China to boost investment in local infrastructure-related real estate assets.
Critics come after S.B.F. for his stance on crypto rules
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the crypto exchange FTX, got skewered by his crypto colleagues after proposing voluntary digital asset standards to better protect consumers last week — and he’s still reeling from the experience. “Whelp, that was an interesting few days,” the billionaire wrote on Twitter on Sunday, responding to complainants denouncing him as “S.B.F. — The Regulator.”
Industry insiders are growing wary of S.B.F. The head of a sprawling global empire mostly built beyond the reach of U.S. regulators, the 30-year-old billionaire has donated about $40 million to various PACs and candidates in the 2022 election cycle and become a fixture on Capitol Hill. Some advocates for decentralized finance have grown increasingly concerned about Bankman-Fried’s high-profile support for a newish Senate Agriculture Committee bill on digital assets, which they feel could set back the DeFi movement.

Bankman-Fried also got into hot water for suggesting that DeFi adopt “know your customer” mandates to appease authorities. Opponents say this would undermine the decentralized crypto ethos, and would force DeFi firms to adopt rules associated with traditional finance. Some users and influential industry voices, meanwhile, have called for a boycott of FTX.
The crypto exec relented after the onslaught. S.B.F. thanked his critics for their input, which he used to revise some of his proposals. Among the most prominent was Erik Vorhees, the libertarian-leaning founder of the platform ShapeShift, who argued that DeFi should remain distanced from regulatory oversight, as it “transcends humans and their political machinations.”
“The devil is in the details,” Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, an industry trade group representing about 100 companies, told DealBook. The industry agrees that centralized exchanges are ready for regulation, she said, but DeFi is new and nuanced and regulating this area would require more time. Translation: S.B.F. should stop speaking for DeFi.
Bankman-Fried thinks congressional action is coming. “It’s important to protect customers and to get federal oversight,” he wrote in an email to DealBook, adding that it’s equally important that code remain free. There’s still “some chance” that a narrow crypto bill that leaves DeFi untouched gets congressional approval after the November election, he predicted. “I think that, if it’s well-drafted (which I’m optimistic it will be!), it would make sense to pass it this year.”

Tuesday: The Saudi Arabia-sponsored “Davos in the Desert” begins. Despite tensions between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. over oil, many U.S. executives still plan to attend.
Wednesday: Meta reports earnings. An advertising slump and new privacy rules from Apple (which reports on Thursday) are expected to have eaten further into its revenue, which in the second quarter dropped for the first time since the company went public.

2022-10-25,"Even Alphabet, the parent company of Google and one of the internet’s most entrenched businesses, was not immune to the punishing blows of the global economy and a sharp slowdown in the online advertising that is essential to the company’s profits.
Alphabet on Tuesday reported a net profit of $13.9 billion in the third quarter, down 27 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbed 6 percent to $69.1 billion. The earnings fell short of analysts’ estimates of $16.9 billion in profit on $71 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by FactSet.
Since Alphabet last released financial results in July, the global economy has worsened, with rising inflation and interest rates as well as slowing growth prompting fears that even tech giants like Google’s parent, insulated by their popular products and piles of cash, would feel some financial pain.
Those worries were realized in Tuesday’s results, which signaled that the online ad market was slowing as advertisers slashed budgets. Alphabet executives said on a call with analysts that they had seen less ad spending for insurance, loans, mortgages and crypto, as well as fewer gaming ads. That coincided with a decline in gaming since the height of the pandemic. The strong dollar also crimped the company’s performance in the most recent quarter.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The company’s search ad sales grew 4 percent to $39.5 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $41 billion. Ruth Porat, the company’s chief financial officer, said that the modest growth was because of difficult comparisons to an unusually strong quarter a year earlier — a trend she said would continue in the fourth quarter.
Ad sales at YouTube, which is owned by Google, declined 1.9 percent to $7 billion, below analysts’ predictions of $7.4 billion. Facing increasing competition from TikTok, YouTube in September placed ads in its quick-video competitor, Shorts, in an effort to bolster revenue.
“The growth in our advertising revenues was also impacted by lapping last year’s elevated growth levels and the challenging macro climate,” Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s chief executive, told analysts. He added that the company would be “responsive to the economic environment.”
Ms. Porat said Alphabet would “realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.”
Alphabet’s stock declined more than 6 percent in post-market trading.
The underwhelming results from Google’s search engine surprised some analysts, including Nikhil Lai at Forrester, who was “less surprised by the weakness of YouTube” because it is harder to gauge a return on investment on the video platform, making it “vulnerable to being cut by marketers who prioritize short-term savings.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Amid the economic turbulence, Mr. Pichai has sought to make the company leaner and more productive. Under his “Simplicity Sprint” plan, which he introduced in July, Mr. Pichai has pursued cost cutting and said he would like the company’s groups to be 20 percent more productive.
Google in September shuttered Stadia, an ambitious service that streamed video games online, and cut funding and jobs at its in-house tech incubator, Area 120. It has also canceled unnecessary business travel but has not yet conducted mass layoffs.
Alphabet says it now has 186,779 employees, an increase of more than 12,000 from the figure it reported in July. The company has said it would slow its hiring — a move in line with peers like Meta and Amazon — to be better prepared for economic uncertainty. Ms. Porat said the company would add fewer than half as many employees in the fourth quarter as it did in the third. She added that Alphabet would continue hiring in 2023 for “critical” roles, particularly top engineering and technical talent.
Google’s cloud computing unit generated $6.9 billion in revenue, a 38 percent jump. The unit lost $699 million in the third quarter, compared with $644 million a year earlier."

Big Tech is cut down to size
The recent rally in technology stocks could come to a screeching halt at the opening bell on Wednesday. Overnight, investors dumped portions of their tech portfolios after disappointing results from Alphabet, Microsoft and Texas Instruments, with the trio reporting that a slowing global economy continues to batter demand for digital advertising, cloud computing and chips.
Over the past seven trading sessions, investors piled back into tech stocks, pushing the Nasdaq up 8.5 percent on hopes the tech giants would show that the worst of the downturn was behind them.
Those investors were greatly disappointed. Microsoft’s sales rose at their slowest rate in five years, as rising energy costs and a strong dollar ate into profits. And Alphabet, the parent company of Google, missed analyst expectations and said growth in its core advertising business had slowed to its weakest point since 2013 (apart from a short period at the start of the pandemic), as companies slashed marketing budgets.

Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s C.E.O., told analysts that it would be “responsive to the economic environment.” Translation: Expect more cost cuts and layoffs. “We are reviewing projects at all scales pretty granularly to make sure we have the right plans there,” Pichai said, “and, based on that, the right resourcing, and making course corrections.”

The global chip market continues to look turbulent, too. Texas Instruments downgraded its full-year outlook as demand softens for its microprocessors, which power consumer products and industrial machinery.
The weak results point to the challenges facing Big Tech, which thrived during an era of low interest rates, low energy prices and low inflation. Investors will be looking for further signs of the sector’s health when Facebook’s owner Meta reports earnings on Wednesday; Apple and Amazon are scheduled for Thursday.
Some big-name investors have been losing patience, even before the latest quarterly results rolled in. Brad Gerstner, head of the hedge fund Altimeter and a large investor in Meta, published an open letter earlier this week to Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s C.E.O., calling for the company to reduce spending by $5 billion annually, limit its investment in metaverse-related projects at $5 billion each year, and cut staff by at least 20 percent.
“Meta needs to rebuild confidence with investors, employees and the tech community in order to attract, inspire, and retain the best people in the world. In short, Meta needs to get fit and focused,” Gerstner wrote.

The rapidly shrinking Ye empire
Adidas’s move on Tuesday to immediately cut ties with Kanye West, now known as Ye, was a key moment in businesses wrangling with too-hot-to-handle provocateurs. New estimates show how much the rapper and designer’s recent behavior, including antisemitic remarks and publicly wearing a shirt with a slogan tied to white supremacy, will cost him financially.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Here are three calculations of how much Ye stands to lose:
The Morningstar analyst David Swartz estimated that the Adidas-Yeezy partnership likely paid Ye in excess of $100 million a year. Overall, Swartz put the collaboration’s value at up to $2 billion.
Forbes reckoned that Adidas-Yeezy accounted for $1.5 billion of Ye’s net worth, and that its demise knocked his wealth down to $400 million.
Bloomberg reported that Adidas-Yeezy earned Ye over $500 million in royalty payments and marketing fees during the first four full years of the deal, through 2020.
Adidas is now indicating that it will sell existing Yeezy merchandise — only without the Yeezy branding. (The German sportswear giant said yesterday that it was the “sole owner” of all design rights to existing products that came out of the partnership.)
More shoes have dropped for Ye. Gap, whose partnership with him ended last month, said it was taking “immediate steps” to remove Yeezy Gap products from its stores and had shut down an affiliated website.

And two pro athletes — Aaron Donald of the Los Angeles Rams and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics — tweeted that they were cutting ties with Donda Sports, Ye’s marketing agency.
Where have the “heavy tweeters” gone?
Reports that Elon Musk has told his bankers he plans to close his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter by Friday is giving the social network’s shares a boost in premarket trading this morning, and they are outperforming most tech stocks. But for Musk, it’s becoming clearer he’ll have a load of problems to solve if he gets to the finish line.
Twitter’s shares closed at $52.78 yesterday, up 2.4 percent and close to Musk’s deal price of $54.20 a share. The reason for investor optimism: Musk is said to have told the bankers helping to finance his takeover that he will meet a court-set deadline to seal the transaction by Friday. (Another potentially positive development: The banks are also said to have sent paperwork to equity investors involved in the deal.)
If Musk doesn’t meet that deadline, he’ll have to finally go through with a trial that could compel him to close on the transaction. DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch takes a look at Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, who has overseen the legal wrangling between Twitter and Musk over the last several months and would supervise that trial.

Internal Twitter documents suggest there may be trouble ahead. Company research showed that “heavy tweeters,” who make up less than 10 percent of monthly overall users but send 90 percent of all tweets and generate half of all revenue, have been in “absolute decline” since the pandemic, according to Reuters.
The negative trend may have been masked by overall growth in daily active users, Reuters reports. A Twitter representative indeed noted that the company’s “overall audience has continued to grow.”
But that growth may not be enough to boost the company’s bottom line. “Even without any Musk-related drama, Twitter will face challenges. The company rarely turns a profit, and growth has been slow for years,” writes The Times’s Kevin Roose, who notes that all of the big social media apps are struggling after a decade of dominance.

Ashton Carter sought the tech industry’s expertise on issues like artificial intelligence.

Ash Carter, the Pentagon’s bridge to Silicon Valley
Ashton Carter, a secretary of defense under President Barack Obama, died on Monday at 68. Though perhaps best known for further opening the U.S. military to women and transgender service members, Carter also focused on building a bridge between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley.
Carter was uniquely qualified to do so. He trained as a theoretical physicist, but gained an interest in policy during his time as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University. He first joined the Pentagon during the Clinton administration, rising through the ranks as a weapons-buying official and expert in nuclear matters, before being nominated as defense secretary by Obama in 2014.
He came to believe that the Pentagon needed Big Tech, particularly to bolster the military’s expertise in artificial intelligence and other advances. “When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially the Defense Department,” he said in a 2015 speech. “Today, much more technology is commercial.”
In his first two years as defense secretary, Carter visited Silicon Valley more times than his predecessors had over two decades. He invoked ideas like “centaur warfighting,” where A.I. augments human capabilities, and sought to convince younger generations of tech executives to partner with the Pentagon. (Many Silicon Valley engineers remain skeptical of letting their work be used by the military, though their employers have still pursued big military contracts.)
“Ash was the best-prepared secretary of defense in our history,” Graham Allison, who worked alongside Carter at Harvard and the Pentagon, told The Times.

2022-10-27,"For much of this year, Amazon’s growth slowed and losses mounted as it faced high costs and changes in people’s shopping habits with the ebbing of the coronavirus pandemic.
On Thursday, the e-commerce giant signaled that its business was rebounding. But it also cautioned that growth would be weak, possibly falling to its lowest level since 2001.
Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle, posted $127.1 billion in sales for the third quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier, showing that high inflation has not pummeled consumer spending. It also returned to profitability, making $2.9 billion after two quarters of losses.
At the same time, Amazon projected that sales might slow to as low as 2 percent in the current quarter, which includes the vital holiday shopping season. Those estimates, which fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations, include a forecast that the strong U.S. dollar will continue to depress international sales.

The results come amid a rocky patch for tech giants. Microsoft, Meta and others have indicated in their earnings this week that tough days may be ahead. On Thursday, a day after Meta revealed that its profits and sales fell in the most recent quarter, the company’s stock plunged more than 24 percent, to its lowest level in at least five years. Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent of Google, also have declined this week.
“We are seeing signs all around that people’s budgets are tight, inflation is still high, energy costs are an additional layer,” Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s finance chief, said on a call with reporters. “We are preparing for what could be a slower growth period.”
He added that demand was particularly weakening in Europe, where inflation and rising fuel costs from the war in Ukraine have affected consumers.
Amazon’s stock dropped more than 19 percent in after-hours trading.
Prices are rising, but the volume of items selling is falling, said Guru Hariharan, whose company, CommerceIQ, advises large consumer brands that sell products on Amazon. “That is a very concerning trend,” he said.
After two years of breakneck expansion, Amazon has spent much of this year putting on the brakes. Andy Jassy, who took over as chief executive last year, has moved to swiftly cut costs after the company overbuilt in anticipation of an extended pandemic-fueled boom in e-commerce. Amazon has curtailed plans to open warehouses and worked to improve the efficiency of its fulfillment operations, and it imposed a hiring freeze for corporate and technology roles for its retail division.

In the third quarter, Amazon benefited from its annual two-day Prime Day sale in July. In the previous year, Prime Day had been held earlier than July. The company called this year’s event its “biggest ever,” and it generated about $6.8 billion in revenue — about $5 billion more than a typical two days — according to estimates from the investment bank Cowen.
Growth in Amazon’s cloud computing division was the slowest on record, increasing 27 percent to $20.5 billion. Amazon Web Services accounted for 16 percent of the company’s total sales but was the only division that produced an operating profit. Mr. Olsavsky said growth slowed in the late summer, as Amazon saw a “lot of customers cutting their bills, which we are glad to help with.”
Its international operations, dragged down by the strong dollar, generated $2.5 billion in operating losses.
The company employed 1.5 million people by the end of the third quarter, almost 100,000 fewer than at the start of the year.
Mr. Olsavsky said Amazon generated more than $1 billion in productivity savings, about half a billion less than executives had hoped. The cost to ship products grew slower than the number of units it sold. But the depressed sales growth makes it harder to operate at optimal efficiency, Mr. Olsavsky said, because the company can best utilize its fulfillment and delivery infrastructure when it has more orders.

Amazon’s lucrative advertising business, which Morgan Stanley estimates is worth about $185 billion, grew 25 percent to $9.5 billion, though there was a slowdown over the quarter as advertisers pulled back. The company’s subscription business, primarily Prime membership, grew 9 percent to $8.9 billion.

2022-10-28,"Workers at a Trader Joe’s store in Brooklyn have voted against unionizing, handing a union its first loss at the company after two victories this year.
The workers voted 94 to 66 against joining Trader Joe’s United, an independent union that represents employees at stores in Western Massachusetts and Minneapolis. Workers at a Trader Joe’s in Colorado filed for an election this summer but withdrew their petition shortly before a scheduled vote.
“We are grateful that our crew members trust us to continue to do the work of listening and responding to their needs, as we always have,” Nakia Rohde, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement after the National Labor Relations Board announced the result on Thursday.

The result raises questions about whether the uptick in union activity over the past year, in which unions won elections at several previously nonunion companies like Starbucks, Amazon and Apple, may be slowing.
Union supporters recently lost an election at an Amazon warehouse near Albany, N.Y., and the pace of unionization at Starbucks has dropped in recent months, though the union has won elections at over 250 of the company’s 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. stores so far.

U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
Workers at a second Apple store recently won an election in Oklahoma City, however, and unions have upcoming votes at a Home Depot in Philadelphia and a studio owned by the video game maker Activision Blizzard in upstate New York.
As of June, Trader Joe’s had more than 500 locations and 50,000 employees across the country and was not unionized. Early in the pandemic, the company’s chief executive sent a letter to employees complaining of a “current barrage of union activity that has been directed at Trader Joe’s” and arguing that union supporters “clearly believe that now is a moment when they can create some sort of wedge in our company.”
The company has said it is prepared to negotiate contracts at its unionized stores. An employee involved in the union, Maeg Yosef, said the two sides were settling on bargaining dates.

Union supporters at the Brooklyn store had said they were seeking an increase in wages, improved health care benefits and paid sick leave as well as changes that would make the company’s disciplinary process more fair.
Before union supporters had a chance to talk with all their colleagues, management became aware of the campaign and announced it in a note posted in the store’s break room in late September. The company also fired a prominent union supporter a day or two later.
Amy Wilson, a leader of the union campaign in the store, said organizing had become more difficult after the firing and the note from management.
“The last core of people hadn’t been spoken to directly by their co-workers, and we lost them instantly,” she said, referring to the note. “It undermined the trust, the relationship. They felt excluded and offended.”
Ms. Rohde, the Trader Joe’s spokeswoman, did not respond to a question about why management posted the break room note. She said that while she couldn’t comment on the firing of the union supporter, “we have never and would never fire a crew member for organizing.”
Trader Joe’s is known for providing relatively good wages and benefits for the industry, though workers have complained that the company has made its health care and retirement benefits less generous over the past decade."
2022-10-29,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil on Sunday faces a crossroads.
After months of pitches to voters, the nation will decide one of Latin America’s most important elections in decades, picking between the two biggest names in modern Brazilian politics and their polar visions for the country.
The choice for Brazilians is whether to give President Jair Bolsonaro a second term, emboldening and empowering him to carry out a far-right mandate for the nation, or whether to bring back former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and return Brazil to a leftist track.
Yet the stakes are far higher than simply a contest between the left and the right.
The election carries major consequences for the Amazon rainforest, which is crucial to the health of the planet. Mr. Bolsonaro has gutted the agencies tasked with protecting the forest, leading to soaring deforestation, while Mr. da Silva has promised to eradicate illegal logging and mining.

Brazil’s economy, once the world’s sixth largest, has flatlined over the past decade. Mr. Bolsonaro pledges to pursue deregulation and privatization to try to jump-start activity, while Mr. da Silva has made his central pitch about feeding and housing the poor, whose numbers have climbed during the pandemic.

The vote is a test of the enduring strength of the right-wing populism that swept across many countries in recent years. Mr. Bolsonaro is one of the biggest remaining faces of that movement, but he is trying to withstand a recent clear shift to the left across Latin America.
And then there is the concern for the health of one of the world’s biggest democracies. Mr. Bolsonaro has spent years attacking Brazil’s democratic institutions, including a sustained effort to undermine its voting system, leading millions of Brazilians to lose faith in the integrity of their nation’s elections.
Now, much of the country is wondering: If the president loses the election, will he accept it?
After Mr. da Silva led in the first round of voting earlier this month, many polls suggest the race has narrowed. The two men have split this country of 217 million people nearly down the middle, with many voters on each side viewing the choice as an existential one for the nation.

“We have a population completely divided between two worlds,” said Malu Gaspar, a political columnist for O Globo, one of Brazil’s biggest newspapers. “So I have a lot of anticipated frustration that this is the most important election of our time, and yet we will come out of it with a lot of more problems than when we went in.”

Misinformation has soared in recent weeks, with supporters of Mr. da Silva accusing Mr. Bolsonaro of being a cannibal and a pedophile, while Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters have called Mr. da Silva a gang leader, a communist and a Satanist who wants to close the nation’s churches.

Election officials have tried to intervene, ordering posts and videos off the internet that they say are false. Those efforts have slowed the deluge of misleading information, but they have also become their own controversy, drawing a swell of complaints of unfair refereeing, particularly from Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies.
The debates between the two candidates devolved into name calling and disputes over their past versus their plans for the future. And there has been a spate of political violence, with countless beatings and at least two killings connected to the election.

This week, the violence and claims of censorship from the right collided when the authorities tried to arrest a right-wing congressman whom the Supreme Court had ordered not to speak publicly because, it said, he had attacked Brazil’s democratic institutions. He responded by shooting at the police and throwing a grenade, injuring two officers. He is now in jail.
With a victory on Sunday, Mr. da Silva would complete a stunning political revival. The former shoeshine boy and metalworker with a fifth-grade education rose to become Brazil’s president in 2003. He then used a commodity boom and the discovery of offshore oil to reshape the country, lifting 20 million Brazilians out of extreme poverty. By the time he left office in 2010, he had an 80 percent approval rating.
But things quickly turned south for him, his leftist Workers Party and Brazil. His handpicked successor’s interventions into the economy helped plunge Brazil into a recession from which it has never fully recovered, and then a corruption investigation revealed a sprawling kickback scheme that had festered deep inside the Brazilian government under his party’s control.

Nearly 300 people were eventually arrested in the scheme, including Mr. da Silva. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison on charges that he accepted a condo and home improvements from companies bidding on government contracts. But after 17 months, he was released and his convictions were later nullified after the Supreme Court ruled that the judge in his cases was biased. While Mr. da Silva was not cleared of wrongdoing, the decision allowed him to run for president again.

Mr. Bolsonaro is a former Army captain who served three decades in Congress as a fringe far-right lawmaker known for extreme statements. In 2018, in the wake of Mr. da Silva’s prison sentence, Mr. Bolsonaro rode the global wave of right-wing populism to the presidency, promising to root out what he called the corruption of Brazil’s leftists.
His four years since have been tumultuous. He has attacked judges, journalists, political rivals and environmentalists, while also publicly doubting the science behind Covid-19. He pushed unproven drugs during the pandemic and delayed in buying vaccines. The coronavirus killed nearly 700,000 people in Brazil, the second-highest official toll, after the United States.
Yet despite the turmoil, Mr. Bolsonaro’s support has endured. He far outperformed polls’ expectations in the first round of voting on Oct. 2, and while recent polls have shown Mr. da Silva still in the lead, Mr. Bolsonaro was within striking distance.
The president’s base is a bloc known as “beef, bibles and bullets,” representing people connected to the agribusiness industry, evangelical movement, and law enforcement and the military. Under a slogan of “God, homeland, family and freedom,” he has focused his pitch on warnings about the left trying to change what he calls Brazilians’ traditional way of life.

In his closing pitch to voters in the first presidential debate this month, Mr. Bolsonaro did not mention the economy, and instead accused the left of wanting to legalize drugs and abortion, abolish private property and force children to learn about “gender ideology” and use unisex bathrooms. “We don’t want a country of retrogression, corruption, thievery and disrespect for our religion,” he said.
Mr. da Silva has built a broad coalition in recent months, from the center-right to the far left, with people concerned about what might happen under a second Bolsonaro term. But he has maintained Brazil’s working class as his base and built his platform around taxing the rich and expanding services for the poor. His stump speech has highlighted a promise that all Brazilians deserve a top cut of meat and a cold beer.
“Let’s get back to fixing this country, and let’s get back to eating and drinking a beer at weekend barbecues,” he said. Mr. Bolsonaro “goes crazy because he thinks only he can, but we want to eat at the barbecues, too.”
The campaign, however, has also had a more worrisome element. For more than a year, Mr. Bolsonaro has warned that he may not accept a loss. He has claimed, without credible evidence, that Brazil’s electronic voting system is rife with fraud and that the left is set on rigging the vote. As a result, three out of four of his supporters say they trust the voting system only a little or not at all.

Over the past week, Mr. Bolsonaro has also begun to claim other kinds of fraud. His campaign has accused radio stations of playing far more ads from Mr. da Silva, which would violate election laws, but the evidence the campaign produced was incomplete and quickly shown to be flawed. Brazil’s election chief, whom Mr. Bolsonaro has called biased, dismissed the accusations.
Yet Mr. Bolsonaro’s son, a congressman, suggested this week that the vote should be delayed because of the alleged fraud, and Mr. Bolsonaro himself is complaining that it is more proof of an unfair election.
“It’s fraud. It interferes with the results of the election,” Mr. Bolsonaro told reporters on Wednesday. “I am a victim once again.”

2022-10-30,"BRASÍLIA — Voters in Brazil on Sunday ousted President Jair Bolsonaro after just one term and elected the leftist former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to replace him, election officials said, a rebuke to Mr. Bolsonaro’s far-right movement and his divisive four years in office.
The victory completes a stunning political revival for Mr. da Silva — from the presidency to prison and back — that had once seemed unthinkable. It also ends Mr. Bolsonaro’s turbulent time as the region’s most powerful leader. It was the first time an incumbent president failed to win re-election in the 34 years of Brazil’s modern democracy.
For years, he attracted global attention for policies that accelerated the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and exacerbated the pandemic, which left nearly 700,000 dead in Brazil, while also becoming a major international figure of the far right for his brash attacks on the left, the media and Brazil’s democratic institutions.
More recently, his efforts to undermine Brazil’s election system drew particular concern at home and abroad, as well as worldwide attention to Sunday’s vote as an important test for one of the world’s largest democracies.

Without evidence, Mr. Bolsonaro criticized the nation’s electronic voting machines as rife with fraud and suggested he might not accept a loss, much like former President Donald J. Trump. Many of his supporters vowed to take to the streets at his command.
Yet in the hours after the race was called, far-right lawmakers, conservative pundits and many of Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters had recognized Mr. da Silva’s victory. By 11 p.m. local time, Mr. Bolsonaro had not spoken publicly.
It was not all quiet. Truckers in the heart of Brazil’s central farming region started fires and tried to block a main highway important for the agriculture industry, according to videos posted on social media and local news reports.

Mr. da Silva won with the narrowest margin of victory for that same period, signaling the deep divide that he will confront as president. He won 50.90 percent of the vote, versus Mr. Bolsonaro’s 49.10 percent, with 99.97 percent of the votes counted Sunday night.

“I will govern for 215 million Brazilians, and not just for those who voted for me,” Mr. da Silva said in his victory speech Sunday night, reading from pages held by his new wife, whom he married this year. “There are not two Brazils. We are one country, one people, one great nation.”

The scandal made him a flawed candidate, and a sizable portion of Brazil still views Mr. da Silva as corrupt. But the strong opposition to Mr. Bolsonaro and his far-right movement was enough to carry Mr. da Silva back to the presidency.

Mr. da Silva’s victory pushes Brazil back to the left, extending a string of leftist victories across Latin America that were fueled by a wave of anti-incumbent backlash. Six of the region’s seven largest countries have now elected leftist leaders since 2018.
A left-wing firebrand who for decades made his name as a champion of the poor, Mr. da Silva now confronts significant challenges. Brazil faces environmental threats, rising hunger, a sputtering economy and a deeply divided population.
His central pitch to voters was that he would lift up the working class, which he said had been forgotten in the four years under Mr. Bolsonaro. In his speech on Sunday, he promised to fight against discrimination and for equality.

Mr. da Silva’s specific plans, however, have been vague.
His stump speech revolved around expanding services for the poor, including more social welfare payments, a higher minimum wage and programs to feed and house more people. To pay for it, he said, he would raise taxes on the rich but also simply increase government spending.
How much he will be able to get done is unclear.
Mr. Bolsonaro’s right-wing party holds the most seats in Congress and a powerful centrist bloc controls both the House and Senate; the country faces worse economic conditions than during Mr. da Silva’s first administration; and the interventionist policies of Mr. da Silva’s handpicked successor as president led Brazil into a recession in 2014 from which it has still not fully recovered.

His election, however, will most likely be good news for the health of the Amazon rainforest, which is vital to the fight against climate change. Mr. Bolsonaro championed industries that extract the forest’s resources while slashing funds and staffing for the agencies tasked with protecting it. As a result, deforestation soared during his administration.

Mr. da Silva has a much better track record on protecting the forest, reducing deforestation while president. He campaigned on a promise to eradicate illegal mining and logging and said he would push farmers to use areas of the forest that had already been cleared.
On Sunday, voting at polling stations went smoothly — but, for many voters, getting there did not. Across Brazil, federal highway agents stopped hundreds of buses carrying voters to the polls and questioned people, including in regions largely supportive of Mr. da Silva.
The elections chief said his agency’s initial investigation found that the stops had delayed the buses, but that they had all still reached their intended polling stations. No voters were blocked from casting their ballots, he said.
Mr. da Silva’s victory was in part thanks to a broad coalition, from communists to centrists, as the Brazilian electorate sought stability after Mr. Bolsonaro’s volatile term, which was marked by clashes with the courts, a pandemic that killed more people than anywhere but the United States, and frequent attacks on the left, the media, academics, health professionals and the nation’s democratic institutions.

Mr. Bolsonaro, 67, has faced a variety of investigations in the Supreme Court and Congress, including for his statements attacking the election system, his handling of the pandemic and his potential involvement in disinformation operations.
So far, he has avoided any consequences from those inquiries, in part because of his immunity as president. After he leaves office on Jan. 1, those investigations could gain steam.

Mr. Bolsonaro has also had much of his activity as president shielded from government-transparency laws because his administration effectively classified many records for up to 100 years, including his vaccine status.
Mr. da Silva has vowed to declassify those records once president. “When we lift the carpet, you’re going to see the rot underneath,” he said at Friday’s debate.

Last year, Mr. Bolsonaro told his supporters there were only three outcomes to the election: He wins, he is killed or he is arrested. He then added, “Tell the bastards I’ll never be arrested.”
That sort of rhetoric raised alarms that Mr. Bolsonaro would not accept the results. He was one of the last world leaders to recognize President Biden’s victory in 2020, repeating Mr. Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen, including just two days before his first meeting with Mr. Biden earlier this year.

Earlier this year, his criticism of the system took on new gravity when Brazil’s military joined in. Leaders of the armed forces pushed election officials for changes to the system, rattling a country that suffered under a military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.
But eventually military and election officials agreed to a change to some tests of the voting machines on Election Day, and military leaders have since suggested they are satisfied with the system’s security.
In recent weeks, military leaders also said privately that they would not support any efforts by Mr. Bolsonaro to challenge the results.

2022-10-31,"The Federal Trade Commission on Monday cracked down on Chegg, an education technology firm based in Santa Clara, Calif., saying the company’s “careless” approach to cybersecurity had exposed the personal details of tens of millions of users.
In a legal complaint, filed on Monday morning, regulators accused Chegg of numerous data security lapses dating to 2017. Among other problems, the agency said, Chegg had issued root login credentials, essentially an all-access pass to certain databases, to multiple employees and outside contractors. Those credentials enabled many people to look at user account data, which the company kept on Amazon Web Services’ online storage system.
As a result, the agency said, a former Chegg contractor was able to use company-issued credentials to steal the names, email addresses and passwords of about 40 million users in 2018. In certain cases, sensitive details on students’ religion, sexual orientation, disabilities and parents’ income were also taken. Some of the data was later found for sale online.
Chegg’s popular homework help app is used regularly by millions of high school and college students. To settle the F.T.C.’s charges, the agency said Chegg had agreed to adopt a comprehensive data security program.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In a statement, Chegg said data privacy was a top priority for the firm and that the company had worked with the F.T.C. to reach a settlement agreement. The company said it currently has robust security practices, and that the incidents described in the agency’s complaint had occurred more than two years ago. Only a small percentage of users had provided data on their religion and sexual orientation as part of a college scholarship finder feature, the company said in the statement.
“Chegg is wholly committed to safeguarding users’ data and has worked with reputable privacy organizations to improve our security measures and will continue our efforts,” the statement said.
The F.T.C.’s enforcement action against Chegg, a prominent industry player, amounts to a warning to the U.S. education technology industry.
Since the early days of the pandemic in 2020, the education technology sector has enjoyed a surge in customers and revenue. To enable remote learning, many schools and universities rushed to adopt digital tools like exam-proctoring software, course management platforms and video meeting systems.
Students and their families, too, turned in droves to online tutoring services and study aids like math apps. Among them, Chegg, which had a market capitalization of $2.7 billion at the end of trading on Monday, reported annual revenues of $776 million for 2021, an increase of 20 percent from the previous year.

Some online learning systems proved so useful that many students, and their educational institutions, continued to use the tools even after schools and colleges returned to in-person teaching.
But the fast growth of digital learning tools during the pandemic also exposed widespread flaws.
Many online education services record, store and analyze a trove of data on students’ every keystroke, swipe and click — information that can include sensitive details on children’s learning challenges or precise locations. Privacy and security experts have warned that such escalating surveillance may benefit companies more than students.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
In March, Illuminate Education, a leading provider of student-tracking software, reported a cyberattack on certain company databases. The incident exposed the personal information of more than a million current and former students across dozens of districts in the United States — including New York City, the nation’s largest public school system.
In May, the F.T.C. issued a policy statement saying that it planned to crack down on ed tech companies that collected excessive personal details from schoolchildren or failed to secure students’ personal information.
The F.T.C. has a long history of fining companies for violating children’s privacy on services like YouTube and TikTok. The agency is able to do so under a federal law, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires online services aimed at children under 13 to safeguard youngsters’ personal data and obtain parental permission before collecting it.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But the federal complaint against Chegg represents the first case under the agency’s new campaign focused specifically on policing the ed-tech industry and protecting student privacy. In the Chegg case, the homework help platform is not aimed at children, and the F.T.C. did not invoke the children’s privacy law. The agency accused the company of unfair and deceptive business practices.
Chegg was founded in 2005 as a textbook rental service for college students. Today it is an online learning giant that rents e-textbooks.
But it is most known as a homework help platform where, for $15.95 per month, students can find ready answers to millions of questions on course topics like relativity or mitosis. Students may also ask Chegg’s online experts to answer specific study or test questions they have been assigned.
Teachers have complained that the service has enabled widespread cheating. Students even have a nickname for copying answers from the platform: “chegging.”
Chegg’s privacy policy promised users that the company would take “commercially reasonable security measures to protect” their personal information. Chegg’s scholarship finder service, for instance, collected information like students’ birth dates as well as details on their religion, sexual orientation and disabilities, the F.T.C. said.

But regulators said the company failed to use reasonable security measures to protect user data, even after a series of security lapses that enabled intruders to gain access to sensitive student data and employees’ financial information.
As part of the consent agreement proposed by the F.T.C., Chegg must provide security training to employees and encrypt user data. Chegg must also give consumers access to the personal information it has collected about them — including any precise location data or persistent identifiers like IP addresses — and enable users to delete their records.
Other online learning services may also hear from regulators. The F.T.C. disclosed in July that it was pursuing a number of nonpublic investigations into ed tech providers.
“Chegg took shortcuts with millions of students’ sensitive information,” Samuel Levine, the director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a news release on Monday. “The commission will continue to act aggressively to protect personal data.”"

Environmentalists in Brazil are breathing a bit more easily after Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who made climate a cornerstone of his campaign, won the country’s presidential election on Sunday.
Da Silva, the former president better known simply as Lula, unseated the incumbent president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose four-year term saw a sharp increase in Amazon deforestation.
Lula faces big challenges, though. Bolsonaro’s policies still resonate with many Brazilians. The incumbent won the popular vote in more than half of the states that make up the forest. In those areas, mining and other industries provide some of the very few economic opportunities.
All of this matters for the climate because, right now, the Amazon locks away and stores huge amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide. In the language of global warming, it’s what’s known as a carbon sink. But further deforestation risks turning the jungle into a huge net emitter of greenhouse gases.
Today I want to tell you what people from both sides of this struggle expect from the new government, and how the outcome may shape humanity’s collective future.

Back to a plan that worked
Policy analysts I talked to say they expect Lula to bring back the cornerstone of his environmental policy when he was last president, between 2003 and 2010. It was multiyear plan to reduce deforestation rates by strengthening environmental protection agencies, bolstering law enforcement and creating protected areas in strategic locations."

In a move that speaks to both the appetite for live programming and the appeal of rising basketball stars like Cunningham, Overtime Elite has entered an agreement with Amazon Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming service, giving Prime Video exclusive streaming rights in the United States to 20 live games per season for the next three years.
Officials for the companies declined to disclose the terms of the deal, which was announced Wednesday. But the companies said that Amazon had also made an investment in Overtime as part of a recent funding round. “It looks a lot like a sports league does,” Dan Porter, chief executive of Overtime, said in an interview ahead of the announcement.

Live sports are “the only thing that hold a linear television bundle together and they’re super valuable,” Porter said. “Look at the success that Amazon is having with ‘Thursday Night Football’ and Apple is going to have with Major League Baseball. I think that that’s the future, and we want to participate in that.”
Amazon, which claims it has more than 200 million subscribers to Amazon Prime, already owns the rights to numerous live sporting events, including in football, baseball, soccer and tennis, and has signaled interest in the N.B.A.

And as it targets an increasingly younger audience, Amazon is adding Overtime Elite, a six-team basketball league featuring top 16- to 20-year-old male players from around the world. The league counts Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, among its investors.
Many of the league’s players hope they will wind up in the N.B.A., just like Dominick Barlow, a 6-foot-10 forward from Dumont, N.J., who played for Overtime Elite last season and is now with the San Antonio Spurs. Among the league’s current players are the 19-year-old twins Ausar and Amen Thompson, who are both projected to be lottery picks in next year’s N.B.A. draft.
When the Thompsons signed with the league for its inaugural season in 2021, they and the other players agreed to contracts worth at least $100,000 each. That, in turn, made them ineligible for college basketball.

Ahead of the league’s second season, Overtime changed course by allowing what it calls a scholarship option, whereby players do not get paid but retain their college eligibility while still being able to earn income through endorsement deals, the same way college athletes have been able to do through so-called name, image and likeness deals.

Cunningham, in consultation with his father, chose that option and is still being recruited by a slew of major men’s college programs, including Duke, Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas and Seton Hall.
Cunningham, speaking in an interview while nursing a sore ankle and eating a slice of pizza after a game, said he has more time to devote to his craft than he would have had at a traditional high school. In that way, Overtime functions similarly to the European training academies that feed professional club teams.
“The skill development, being able to play against top players every day, it’s like there’s no room for slacking, there’s no room to goof off,” Cunningham said. “You’re always going to be working, you’re always getting better.”
Still, Overtime isn’t for everyone.

A year ago, Efton Reid, a center rated as a five-star recruit, turned down a six-figure offer in favor of attending Louisiana State because the new professional league planned to play against prep school opponents.
Reid’s mother, Maria, said in an interview at the time that he had already done that while at IMG Academy in Florida “and did not want to repeat another year playing against prep schools.” She added: “He wants to play against the next level college ball.”
Reid has since transferred to Gonzaga.
In August, the Michigan State commit Jeremy Fears reversed his original plan to play for Overtime and instead will spend his senior season playing at Joliet West High School in Illinois with his brother.
Back in New York and New Jersey, some coaches of high-profile prospects expressed concern about letting their players compete against the Overtime Elite teams, fearing they might be recruited to join the league and thus leave their high school teams. Of course, nothing was stopping the league from reaching out to those players anyway.
Simeon Wilcher, a 6-foot-5 senior point guard at Roselle Catholic and an honors student, turned down what his father said was a high-six-figure offer from Overtime Elite in August 2021 because he preferred the more traditional high school experience, including playing high school basketball. Last year, he helped lead the Lions to their fourth New Jersey Tournament of Champions title, beating D.J. Wagner, the No. 1 prospect in the class of 2023, and Camden High School in the final. (They also beat Cunningham and his Gill St. Bernard’s team along the way.)

Wilcher also wanted other benefits from high school, like staying with his friends and attending the big events.
“You always got to love the regular high school stuff, like prom, graduation,” he said. “All of that is needed, that’s memories that you’ll never be able to get back.”
Still, Wilcher, who committed to North Carolina last fall, is earning endorsement money, his father, Sergio Wilcher, said, through various deals. It is increasingly common for high-profile high school basketball players to have agents representing them for name, image and likeness deals, but Wilcher doesn’t have one, his father said.
Jonathan Givony, an N.B.A. draft expert for ESPN, sat in the stands at Roselle Catholic taking notes on each player on a spreadsheet to prepare for future N.B.A. mock drafts.

“There is no comparison between a public school and what O.T.E. has to offer in terms of the platform that they offer, the national exposure, the competition that they play, the schedule,” Jonathan Givony of ESPN said.

He said there is a benefit to Overtime Elite in that players who want to be future pros like Cunningham can devote themselves to their craft and find themselves playing in front of more fans more quickly.
“There is no comparison between a public school and what O.T.E. has to offer in terms of the platform that they offer, the national exposure, the competition that they play, the schedule,” he said.
Ross Perlstein and Owen Burns, 13-year-old fans from Livingston, N.J., didn’t really care which players competed for Overtime Elite or the high school teams at Roselle Catholic. Burns wore a North Carolina jersey autographed by Roy Williams, its former coach, and asked Wilcher, Cunningham and several other players to add their signatures.
“I feel like a lot of these guys are going to play overseas or in the N.B.A.,” Perlstein said, “so I feel like we’re watching what they’re becoming.”"
2022-11-03,"SAN FRANCISCO — The technology industry’s slowdown came into even sharper relief on Thursday as Amazon publicly said it had paused hiring for its corporate work force and several other technology companies announced job cuts.
Amazon said senior executives decided this week to pause incremental corporate hiring because the economy was “in an uncertain place.” The move added to a freeze from last month, when the e-commerce giant halted corporate and technology hiring in its retail business for the rest of the year.
“We anticipate keeping this pause in place for the next few months, and will continue to monitor what we’re seeing in the economy and the business,” said Beth Galetti, the Amazon executive in charge of human resources, in a note posted internally and on the company’s blog.
At the same time, Lyft said it would cut 13 percent of its employees, or about 650 of its 5,000 workers. Stripe, a payment processing platform, said it would cut 14 percent of its employees, roughly 1,100 jobs.
Tech giants including Meta and Amazon have been slowing down their hiring for months, while smaller tech companies such as Robinhood and Coinbase have announced layoffs. But rarely have so many job cuts and hiring freezes in the industry been disclosed on the same day.
Tech companies have led the way for the U.S. economy over the past decade, lifting the stock market during the worst days of the coronavirus pandemic. But in recent weeks, many of the largest firms reported financial results that suggested they were feeling the impact of global economic jitters, soaring inflation and rising interest rates.

With less than a week until Election Day, a new economic report showed the strength of the job market despite policymakers’ efforts to constrain it in their fight against inflation.
The employment figures immediately made their way into both parties’ closing pitches to voters, with President Biden proclaiming that “our jobs recovery remains strong” even as Republicans said that the numbers were disappointing.
But the story is far more complex than any political statement would make it seem.
In normal times, the report from the Labor Department — which showed 261,000 jobs added in October, a low unemployment rate and rising wages — would be hailed as evidence of economic strength. Yet at a time when prices are climbing at their fastest rate in generations, robust gains last month might have been too much of a good thing. The Federal Reserve is worried that a hot job market is forcing employers to raise wages, which is leading to higher prices and more inflation.
The employment figures show that job growth is cooling, just very gradually, suggesting that a recession is not imminent. The gains were the weakest of the year and the lowest since December 2020.
“Today’s report shows that the job market is losing altitude,” said Daniel Zhao, an economist at the career site Glassdoor, “but isn’t in danger of slamming into the ground yet.”
The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7 percent, from 3.5 percent in September. That rate is based on a different survey than the one that provides the hiring numbers, and the two reports sometimes diverge in ways that are hard for analysts to explain.

2022-11-05,"The Congo Basin’s Cuvette Centrale, the world’s largest complex of tropical peatlands, covers an area slightly larger than the state of New York and stores the equivalent of three years of global carbon dioxide emissions. Like other peatlands around the world, it is a potential carbon bomb. When disturbed, these swampy freshwater landscapes unleash their carbon, trapping ever more heat in the atmosphere and intensifying global warming.
Even so, most of this region of forest and wetlands has been mapped for potential oil and gas exploration. Several areas are already being auctioned off for oil drilling by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which contains two-thirds of the peatland complex. Only about a tenth of the region lies in protected areas.
Globally, these wetlands make up only 3 percent of the earth’s land area but store twice as much carbon as all of the trees on the planet. Yet for all their importance, these landscapes have been largely forgotten in the global effort to address the climate crisis. This oversight has been hugely consequential and looms ever more so.
Peatlands are filled with deep accumulations of slowly decomposing plants and other organic material known as peat. They are carbon sinks, absorbing more carbon than they release into the atmosphere, and have been crucial in slowing planetary warming. They also absorb, filter and release rainwater slowly, helping to ease droughts and floods that have increased in severity with changes to the climate. But increasingly, these landscapes are being decimated, and global action is required to protect them — and the climate.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
This coming week, that challenge is expected to be a subject of discussion among leaders from countries around the world as they convene in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the United Nations climate conference. Hopefully this will lead to action soon; development pressures on these landscapes are intensifying.
A changing climate, a changing world
Card 1 of 4
Climate change around the world: In “Postcards From a World on Fire,” 193 stories from individual countries show how climate change is reshaping reality everywhere, from dying coral reefs in Fiji to disappearing oases in Morocco and far, far beyond.
The role of our leaders: Writing at the end of 2020, Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, found reasons for optimism in the Biden presidency, a feeling perhaps borne out by the passing of major climate legislation. That doesn’t mean there haven’t been criticisms. For example, Charles Harvey and Kurt House argue that subsidies for climate capture technology will ultimately be a waste.
The worst climate risks, mapped: In this feature, select a country, and we'll break down the climate hazards it faces. In the case of America, our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths.
What people can do: Justin Gillis and Hal Harvey describe the types of local activism that might be needed, while Saul Griffith points to how Australia shows the way on rooftop solar. Meanwhile, small changes at the office might be one good way to cut significant emissions, writes Carlos Gamarra.
The world’s richest countries should lead by example by protecting their own peatlands while also committing money to safeguard these landscapes in developing countries. Government and business leaders from Canada to Congo could then work together to deliver the protection required while also investing in local economies, creating jobs and defending the rights of the Indigenous and local communities that depend on peatlands.
Here’s the scope of the challenge. Roughly 15 percent of peatlands globally have already been drained, and another 5 percent to 10 percent have been degraded. Those global figures mask huge regional differences. But cumulatively, these damaged landscapes release as much as 5 percent of all of the carbon emissions caused by human activity each year.
With so much carbon at stake, the danger arises when peatlands are burned or when they are drained and then dry out, exposing the peat to oxygen-rich air, which greatly accelerates their decomposition and sends the stored carbon into the atmosphere. The fire peril was made especially clear in Indonesia in 2015, when emissions from fires set by farmers to clear forest and peatlands exceeded carbon emissions from the entire United States over dozens of days.
Peatlands are found on every continent. They range from the open, mossy high latitudes of Northern Europe, Russia, Canada and Alaska to the dark, woody tropical swamps of Southeast Asia and the Amazon Basin to the southernmost reaches of Patagonia.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Economic agendas clash with peatland protection in all of those places.
Oil exploration and development has already damaged peatlands in the western Amazon, Niger and the Sumatra basins, and now menaces the vast Congo Basin.
In Southeast Asia, peatlands have been drained to plant acacia trees to produce wood fiber, or African oil palms used in oil-based derivatives that are found in many of the products on a supermarket’s shelves. Thanks to strong government action in the region, the scale of the disturbance has diminished, but areas already drained continue to emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Plans for large-scale mineral extraction in northern Canada directly threaten the world’s second-largest peatland complex — the remote Hudson Bay lowland. Vast areas, including Indigenous territories, are at risk there from proposed mining and the construction of roads and other infrastructure.
In Peru, a proposed 435-mile road from the isolated port city of Iquitos through the interior of the Amazon to the town of Saramiriza jeopardizes the hydrology supporting a large expanse of peatland; it also augurs more haphazard development that will bring its own threats.
And around the world, peat has been collected in large quantities and sold for gardening or used as fuel. That’s where the peat moss used in gardens originates.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
For all of the threats, peatland restoration is gaining increasing attention and financial resources, including in the European Union, where half of the peatland has been degraded. Since 2016, Indonesia has restored several million acres of degraded peatland and is working to restore roughly two million more acres by 2024.
These efforts offer reason to cheer, and we should expand this work elsewhere. But even with the best restoration efforts, degraded peatlands won’t regain all of the carbon they have lost to the atmosphere for hundreds or even thousands of years.
The global climate crisis won’t be solved just by protecting peatlands, but it can’t be solved without them. Saving these landscapes is essential to slow the planet’s warming.
Daniel Zarin is the executive director of forests and climate change at the Wildlife Conservation Society, a global organization based in New York. He oversees the group’s efforts to promote forests and peatlands as essential parts of the solution to the climate crisis.

2022-11-06,"Weeks after expressing optimism about the global economy and its business, Apple on Sunday warned that its sales would fall short of expectations because a key iPhone factory in China had been shut down by a coronavirus outbreak.
The abrupt change in its business prospects are the latest reminder of the risks of the company’s concentrated manufacturing supply chain in China. Once an operational strength that afforded Apple the flexibility to have legions of workers crank out iPhones to meet global demand, its reliance on China has become a liability as the country’s commitment to a zero Covid-19 policy has led it to lock down cities, businesses and factories.
In mid-October, Apple’s largest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, shut off the primary plant in Zhengzhou as coronavirus cases spiked. Foxconn closed the facility to the outside world and walled roughly 200,000 workers inside its grounds. Production of iPhones has continued at “a significantly reduced capacity,” Apple said in a statement on Sunday. The company added that its production woes would mean that customers would face longer wait times between the purchase and delivery of its high-end iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.
“We are working closely with our supplier to return to normal production levels while ensuring the health and safety of every worker,” Apple said in its statement.

The shutdown is the second to affect Apple this year. It lost about $4 billion in sales of iPads and Macs over the spring and summer after factories outside of Shanghai were closed to limit the spread of Covid-19.
Apple’s setback comes amid a larger downturn in the prospects for the tech industry. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta have tumbled this year amid an economic slowdown that has caused e-commerce and advertising sales to falter. Apple’s share prices has slipped but avoided the steep declines of its peers in large part because it continued to deliver strong business results.
China’s zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been promoted by China’s top leader, Xi Jinping. The country’s leadership has remained committed to that policy in the wake of Mr. Xi’s election to a third term.
Apple’s presence in China is so prominent that locals refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.” At full tilt, the Foxconn factory there was capable of producing 500,000 iPhones a day. It is the largest single plant for the iPhone, which accounts for more than half of Apple’s annual sales.
“This is what Apple has feared,” said Wayne Lam, a technology analyst with CCS Insight. “China is not letting its foot off this zero Covid policy, and it’s going to have a big impact because these premium phones were the last area of the smartphone market that have been in demand.”

After Foxconn locked down its Zhengzhou plant, some factory workers fled the facility and began walking toward their homes across the countryside. Images and videos of them fleeing spread across social media. Leo Lin, a 29-year-old factory worker who spoke to The New York Times last week said that many workers panicked as quarantine facilities began to overflow.
Foxconn responded by offering workers an extra $14 a day to continue working. It later increased those payments to $55 a day.
Apple has begun to diversify its supply chain away from China, shifting production of some iPhones to India and other products to Vietnam. But the company still relies on China to produce more than 90 percent of the iPhones that it sells, according to analysts.
The push to diversify is “clearly not fast enough,” Mr. Lam said."

Ocean-Eaten Islands, Fire-Scarred Forests: Our Changing World in Pictures
By The New York Times
Nov. 8, 2022
Climate change does not lend itself to easy documentation.
Like nature itself, it can move slowly. Change can come in increments, and it is not always clear what to make of it.
Did that species die out because our home is growing too warm? Or was another cause the primary factor in the extinction? Is today’s raging wildfire or monster storm part of something bigger? Or are they just one-offs?
No single change tells the story of a climate in crisis, but a seemingly endless succession of them is another matter. Likewise, no single image, no matter how powerful, can capture what is happening, but our photographers have come back from their global travels with an encyclopedia’s worth.
Collected here is a roundup of some of the best visual journalism about climate change that New York Times journalists have produced over the past few years. From methane-spewing feedlots in the Texas Panhandle to a hurricane-drowned church in Louisiana, and from ocean-eaten Easter Island in Chile to fire-scarred New South Wales in Australia, our visual journalists have gone out to take the pulse of an ailing planet.

They called it a “super typhoon,” and after it left in December 2021, the smell of death hung in a central Philippine province. The winds from Typhoon Rai reached 168 miles per hour, and when it was over, the country’s Climate Change Commission called for urgent action “to build community resilience against extreme climate-related events.”

MEYERS, CALIF.
Thousands of firefighters, 25 helicopters and an arsenal of more than 400 fire engines and 70 water truck were sent to battle the flames near Lake Tahoe in the summer of 2021, yet the Caldor fire still advanced. Experts believe it offered a cautionary tale for the next megafires in the West, and it lay bare a certain futility in trying to fully control the most aggressive wildfires.

Sea Turtle Sanctuary Has Survived 40 Years. Climate Change May Kill It.

APO ISLAND, the Philippines — The large green sea turtles used to be terrified of humans, scuttling away as fast as they could.
“When the turtles saw people, it was like they saw a ghost,” said Mario Pascobello, a resident of Apo Island in the Philippines. “In the old days, they were being slaughtered here,” he added, with the island’s fishermen feasting on their flesh and their eggs.
Now, the endangered green turtles, largely herbivorous, peacefully graze in the shallows off Apo’s coast, unbothered by the fishermen, who share the waters with them.
But if the turtles are no longer menaced by the fishermen here, they do face another man-made threat: climate change.

2022-11-10,"When Stripe, a payments start-up valued at $74 billion, laid off more than 1,000 employees this month, its co-founders blamed themselves. “We overhired for the world we’re in,” they wrote. “We were much too optimistic.”
After Elon Musk, Twitter’s new owner, slashed the company’s staffing in half last week, Jack Dorsey, a founder and former chief executive of the social media service, claimed responsibility. “I grew the company size too quickly,” he wrote on Twitter.
And on Wednesday, when Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, shed 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, blamed overzealous expansion. “I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,” he wrote in a letter to employees. “Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”
The chorus of conceding by tech executives that they hired too many people is ricocheting across Silicon Valley as the industry rushes to make cuts, blaming a worsening economy.

But at least part of the surge in layoffs was self-inflicted. When the companies enjoyed soaring profits and a belief that the pandemic-fueled boom times would keep going, they aggressively expanded by hoarding the most fought-over and expensive resource in the software business: talent.
Silicon Valley tech companies have long seen hiring as more than just filling openings. The industry’s fierce talent wars showed that companies like Google and Meta were gaining the best and brightest. Ballooning staffs and a long reign atop lists of the most-desired jobs for college graduates were emblems of growth, deep pockets and prestige. And to employees, the work became something larger — it was an identity.

This mentality became ingrained at the largest tech companies, which offer numerous perks on lavish corporate campuses that rival universities. It was echoed by smaller start-ups, which dangle a chance at life-changing wealth in the form of stock options.
Now these practices are giving the tech industry indigestion.
“When times are flush, you get excesses, and excesses lead to overhiring and optimism,” said Josh Wolfe, an investor at Lux Capital. “For the past 10 years, the abundance of cash led to an abundance of hiring.”

More than 100,000 tech workers have lost their jobs this year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks layoffs. The cuts range from well-known publicly traded companies like Meta, Salesforce, Booking.com and Lyft to highly valued private start-ups such as the Gopuff delivery service and the Chime and Brex financial platforms.
Many of the job losses have taken place in tech’s most experimental areas. Astra, a rocket company, cut 16 percent of its staff this week after tripling its head count last year. In the cryptocurrency industry, which has suffered a meltdown this year, high-value companies including Crypto.com, Blockchain.com, OpenSea and Dapper Labs have cut hundreds of workers in recent months.
Tech leaders were too slow to react to signs of an economic slowdown that emerged this spring, after many of the companies had already been on hiring sprees for several years, tech analysts said.
Meta, whose valuation soared past $1 trillion, doubled its staff to 87,314 people over the past three years. Robinhood, the stock trading app, expanded its work force nearly sixfold in 2020 and 2021.
“They’ve charged ahead with these plans that are no longer based on reality,” said Caitlyn Metteer, director of recruiting at Lever, a provider of recruiting software.

For many, it’s a moment of shock. “Are we in a bubble” panics in the tech industry over the last decade have always been short-lived, followed by a rapid return to even frothier good times. Even those who predicted that pandemic behaviors enabled by the likes of Zoom, Peloton, Netflix and Shopify would ebb now say they underestimated the extent.
Many believe this downturn will last longer because of the macroeconomic factors that created it. For the past decade, low interest rates pushed investors into riskier assets that offered higher returns. Those investors valued fast growth over profits and rewarded companies that took big risks.

In recent years, tech companies responded to the flood of cash from investors and a rapidly growing business by pouring money into expansion via sales and marketing, hiring, acquisitions and experimental projects. The excess capital encouraged companies to staff up, adding fuel to the war for talent.
“The pressure is to just spend the money quick enough so you can grow fast enough to justify the kinds of investments V.C.s want to make,” said Eric Rachlin, an entrepreneur who co-founded Body Labs, an artificial intelligence software company that Amazon bought.

Expanding head count was also a way for managers to advance their careers. “Getting more people on the team is easier than telling everyone to just work super hard,” Mr. Rachlin said.
That led the tech industry to gain a reputation for corporate bloat. Rumors often circulated of highly compensated workers who clocked just a few hours of work a day or juggled multiple remote jobs at once, alongside elaborate office perks like free laundry, massages and renowned cafeteria chefs. This spring, Meta scaled back its perks, including laundry service.
In the past, tech workers could quickly change jobs or land on their feet if they were cut because of the plethora of open positions, but “I don’t think we know yet if everyone in this wave of layoffs will be able to do that,” Mr. Rachlin said.
Some people see a chance to help those entering a difficult job market for the first time. Stephen Courson recently left a career in sales and strategy at Gartner, the research and consulting firm, and Salesforce to create financial content. He initially planned to focus on time management, but after many of his friends went through painful layoffs he began working on a course that helps people prepare for job interviews. It’s a skill that many of today’s job hunters never had to hone in flush times.
“This isn’t going to get better quickly,” he said.
Amid the drumbeat of layoff announcements, investors see an opportunity. They are quick to point out that well-known successes of the last decade — companies like Airbnb, Uber, Dropbox — were created in the aftermath of the Great Recession.

This week, Day One Ventures, a venture capital firm, announced Funded Not Fired, a program that aims to invest $100,000 into 20 new start-ups where at least one founder was laid off from a tech company. Within 24 hours, hundreds of people had applied, said Masha Bucher, founder of the firm.
“Some of the people are saying, ‘This is a sign I’ve been waiting for,’” she said. “It really gives people hope.”
In the meantime, there may be more layoff announcements — delivered through the now standard form of a letter from the chief executive posted to a company blog.
These letters have taken on a familiar format. The bosses explain the grim economic outlook, citing inflation, “energy shocks,” interest rates, “one of the most challenging real estate markets in 40 years” or “probable recession.” They take the blame for growing too fast. They offer up support to those affected — severance, visa help, health care, career guidance. They express sadness and thank everyone.
And they reaffirm the company’s mission."

I’m not crazy. You’re the one who’s crazy. You’re driving me crazy.
Those raw lyrics from “Institutionalized” — my favorite song from the early ’80s hardcore band Suicidal Tendencies — kept moshing in my head as I watched this darkly funny and ingeniously affecting comedy-thriller.
The film begins as old college friends reunite to throw a 31st birthday party for Pete (Tom Stourton) at an estate in the British countryside. Despite the laughs and the booze, Pete can’t help but be disappointed that his friends haven’t matured much. But also: Who’s Harry (Dustin Demri-Burns), the inconsiderate stranger? And why does it seem as if Harry and everyone else in the house wants to sabotage Pete’s celebration?
Andrew Gaynord’s feature film debut is a terrific “small-h” horror comedy — a good pick for people who don’t love horror. It balances creeping dread and bald comedy, and explores difficult topics — mental health, social anxiety — with smarts, not big scares. Stourton gives a funny but mournful performance as a man screaming “I’m not crazy” into a void. The ending threw me, and moved me, too.

‘Sawed Off’
Rent or buy on most major platforms.
Jon (Jody Barton) and Frank (Trae Ireland) drive to a remote cabin where Marjorie (Eva Hamilton) — a woman they both dated — has invited them to spend time hunting and hanging out. On the way, they almost run over a guy in the road.
At the cabin, they find strange symbols on a wall that might be related to a local legend about homesteaders who were doomed to live forever off human flesh. Then things get weird, as Jon accidentally shoots Frank during a hunt and Frank shockingly comes back to life, his old body now a corpse. Time and space collapse as the two men kill each other over and over — by stabbing, fists, dismemberment — leaving behind a landscape of bodies. Whose cursed cabin is this anyway?
Hunter Johnson’s gross-out, low-budget indie is a scrappy lesson in how to make potent horror on a dime. Science fiction, folk horror and absurdist comedy smoothly mingle in a story about letting go of love; when Marjorie says “We’re stuck,” she’s not just talking about being afraid to leave the cabin. Distorted audio vexes parts of the film, but Richard Trejo’s eerie cinematography and Oliver Poser’s grisly makeup effects come to the rescue.

When I want a horror movie to punch me in the face, I’ve got a guy for that: Gaspar Noé. His transgressive drama “Irreversible” (2002) is the only film that’s ever made me physically sick, as much for its spinning camerawork as for its merciless violence.
His films can be disorienting, and that’s what I enjoyed most about watching “Lux Aeterna,” his backstage drama starring Béatrice Dalle and Charlotte Gainsbourg as actresses navigating the making of a witch-burning scene on a chaotic movie set. Using a split-screen, Noé follows the two women as they butt heads with their director and the crew over who’s in charge of what.
But the bickering is just the lead-up to the main reason to see the film: the spectacular finale. It’s a hellscape of pulsating colored lights, blood curdling screams and a woman in flames — a punishing visual nod to a frank discussion about filmmaking and misogyny that Dalle and Gainsbourg have in the film’s opening. At a nimble 51 minutes, this is in-your-face horror in a hurry.

I’ve never seen a horror movie from Nigeria, so I’m glad I stumbled across this anthology of films written and directed by three filmmakers from the Nigerian cinema collective Surreal16. Although the stories are modest in scale and tread familiar horror territory, they were for me a terrific cinematic introduction to Nigerian urban legends and folklore.
My favorite of the three films is C. J. Obasi’s supernatural cautionary tale “Suffer the Witch.” Chinwe (Bukola Oladipupo), a young college student, faces off with her friend and classmate Joy (Nengi Adoki) after Chinwe wonders if Joy might be using witchcraft to sabotage her crush on the handsome Ikenna (Timini Egbuson) so he’ll have eyes for Joy instead. What sets this segment apart is Adoki’s unhinged performance; she summons the face of evil with nothing more than a half-smile and a cock of her head. (If somebody wants to turn “Suffer the Witch” into a feature film, you’ve got your leading lady.)
Shot in Lagos, all three films are told in a simple but dramatic visual style, thanks to the macabre instincts of the cinematographer Femi Awojide.

You think you know your husband until you find him at a campfire in the woods delicately munching on his own arm. It’s here, about 30 minutes in, that the writer-director Alex Smoot first starts to take his low-budget psychological thriller down a sinister path.

Until then, it’s an extra-slow burn. The film opens as college sweethearts Hugh (Gil McKinney) and Alyssa (Natasha Krishnan) retreat to an isolated cabin in upstate New York to try to salvage their troubled marriage. There’s still love there, despite the bitter arguments. But as Hugh develops a taste for fresh meat — like when he kills and eats a rabbit on the spot — their relationship faces a supernatural threat from a monster that knows the woods’ hiding places better than they do.
Smoot’s atmospheric feature debut is more of a dark mood piece than a straight-up scary movie, which is why I’d recommend it only for patient horror fans who don’t need scares at a clip. Too bad a lackluster cat-and-mouse game in the final stretch gives short shrift to the film’s central, terrifying question: What do you do when someone you love becomes a monster you love but fear? The cinematographer Jason Krangel fills the narrative gaps with eerie shadow play."
2022-11-12,"Rob Delaney is lying on a taupe-colored couch in his London home on a Tuesday afternoon in early October, wearing a faded black Cracker Barrel T-shirt. He holds his phone high overhead so I can see his face.
“I would have gone for the big Zoom setup where you’re sitting up,” he said, “but since we’re going to be talking about Henry, I just wanted to be comfy.”
Henry is Delaney’s 2½-year-old son, the third of his four children. Henry died of brain cancer on that same taupe couch in January 2018. It might seem strange to some that a parent would keep a piece of furniture like that, let alone lie on it for an interview where he will be talking about such a devastating loss, but that’s the thing about grief. You might want to set fire to the reminders, or sink into them. You may feel rage one minute and a burst of love the next. There’s no right or wrong, no explanation needed.
So Delaney, the Emmy-nominated co-creator and co-star of the Amazon Prime series “Catastrophe,” is lying on this couch, talking about his son and about his second book, “A Heart That Works,” published by Coronet in Britain last month and in the United States by Spiegel & Grau on Nov. 29. It’s a raw, painful and, at times, darkly funny memoir about Henry’s life and death, and the anguish of losing a child.
ADVERTISEMENT

“I figured a book would bubble out of me at some point, or something inspired by Henry,” Delaney, 45, said, “but it wasn’t my idea to write it.”
That idea came from Harriet Poland, an editor at Coronet. She’d read his 2013 essay collection, “Mother. Wife. Sister. Human. Warrior. Falcon. Yardstick. Turban. Cabbage,” which chronicles his upbringing in Massachusetts, his escapades stealing porn and bungee-jumping drunk, the near-fatal car crash that led to his sobriety and his breakthrough as a comedian on Twitter, back when Twitter was still more funny than fraught. Poland wrote to Delaney about her own experience with grief: As a child, she helped care for her father when he was dying of a brain tumor. She had read Delaney’s essays and knew about Henry, so she asked if he’d thought of writing another book.
Before he responded, Delaney typed a few pages that he knew might be tough to read, sent them to Poland and asked if she was sure she wanted this book. He had no intention of glossing over the most wrenching moments. Poland told him that his honesty about grief was exactly what the world needed.
Once he committed, he wrote about 1,200 words a day, five days a week.
“I was surprised how regimented and disciplined I was,” Delaney said. In his first book, he described his process as “brutal and lonely.” Having since spent four seasons writing episodes of “Catastrophe,” he now knows that he’s happiest when he’s “clickety clacking on the keyboard. For a first draft this time, I was pretty well behaved.”
Image

The title “A Heart That Works” comes from a Juliana Hatfield lyric, “A heart that hurts is a heart that works,” that appears in his first book. That quote is his life philosophy, especially now. He also told me that Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” is the “prime text on grief and how it feels,” and said that a template for his own book could be Graham Greene’s “The End of the Affair,” which starts with, “This is a record of hate far more than of love.”

In other words, Delaney wanted his book to be excruciating.
“I wanted to ruin people’s day,” he said. “I wanted to ruin their week or their month. I wanted people to feel like they’d picked up a book, perhaps for entertainment, perhaps for enlightenment, and I wanted them to be punished.”
The book had the intended effect on Aisling Bea, a comedian and actress who became close with Delaney’s family when they moved to London from Los Angeles so he could film “Catastrophe.” When Delaney gave her an advance copy, Bea, who wrote about her father’s suicide for The Guardian in 2017, said she could “feel it burning” in her backpack as she walked home. She read it in 24 hours, reliving memories of staying with Henry in the hospital so his parents could shower or spend time with their other sons, and her own grief over Henry’s death.
It also helped her see Delaney’s story in a new light.
“It’s actually really cathartic to hear people who won’t allow themselves to be filtered, and who aren’t the nicest possible version of themselves,” she said. “Rob is disarmingly open. It’s just a relief to read someone saying how knackering and tiring and ugly it feels.”
In America and Britain, grief and death — especially the death of a child — are often treated as experiences that should be whispered about, delicately, and only during times when it won’t make everyone else uncomfortable. Delaney’s book sets that notion on fire. Through his words, he’s thrashing and wailing and lamenting as loudly as he can, begging the reader to scream with him, to feel what he feels.
“That is one thing grief does to me. It makes me want to make you understand,” he writes in the first chapter.

When he later describes administering powdered morphine through Henry’s feeding tube, Delaney writes, “I’m glad it was bright red. The thing you put into your dying child to dull his pain should be bright red, like a flag or a flare or a fire truck racing to disaster.”
His wife, Leah, read pages along the way (she wasn’t available for an interview, he said). She gave Delaney notes that proved to be invaluable, like urging him to include a story about filming a scene for an action comedy where a character was going to be shot in the throat. Because of Henry’s tracheostomy tube, which his parents had to clean and replace once a month, Delaney writes that he arrived on set that day “feeling fuzzy and slow and afraid of the prospect of watching a world-class special-effects team make blood blast out of a hole in a woman’s throat.”
He pulled the director and showrunner aside and explained his hesitation. They apologized and asked what he needed. Maybe a break? Would it help if they had the character shot in the face instead? Delaney told them to proceed. What he needed wasn’t to change the action but to express his fear. Their empathy helped him go on with the scene.
It’s a passage that illuminates the triggers of grief, the importance of being free to speak, and a father’s ability to keep on filming an action comedy, even in the face of such sorrow.
“Here’s something I’m almost surprised I didn’t put in the book,” Delaney said. “It’s a sort of mantra that I developed early in the acute grief process. I would tell myself, ‘It’s OK, you’ll be sad forever.’ I found that very freeing because then it was like, oh, I don’t have to do this all right now? I don’t have to march through this expecting and desiring an end? I can put it down for a minute and come pick it up again. I can relax.”

Midway through our conversation, Delaney took a break so he could try and score a coveted reservation to swim at a nearby pond. “A Heart That Works” begins with a story about his fear of dying in ponds and lakes, and his wife’s attempts to lure him to participate in her frequent swims (because she thinks he’ll enjoy it, not because she’s trying to torture him). At one point after Henry’s death, his parents took a scuba diving course. During a flash of panic in the dark water, Delaney writes that he was “at harmony with the knowledge that my son died and that my own death would see me walk through a door that he had walked through. We would share one more thing together.”
The reservation proves to be complicated, requiring credit card numbers and too much information for Delaney to deal with at that moment. So we got back to talking about his book, about how funny Henry was, about writing through and living with grief. I asked him if his feelings about comedy, or his ideas about humor, changed since Henry died.
His 1.5 million Twitter followers still get jokes about Kegel exercises and his wife’s imaginary boyfriend, but Delaney also tweets about Henry and children’s hospice charities. “I have to laugh,” he said. “I always had the mental kink where to not do comedy would be to die. Now it’s the same. I would still die if I didn’t laugh and make funny things, so it’s still a desperate need that I nurture.”

Delaney and his family are rooted in London now. His sons go to school there, he and Leah have close friends, including other parents who have lost a child, and those relationships have become a lifeline for them both. He wrote and shot the fourth and final season of “Catastrophe” after Henry died, and played a bumbling crook alongside Ellie Kemper in the 2021 movie “Home Sweet Home Alone.” He’s still acting, still writing. He thinks about Henry through all of it.
As heartbreaking as the book may be, Delaney’s pitch black humor buoys even the toughest moments. He writes about how horror movies became an escape for him and Leah: Their child was sick, but hey, they weren’t being sawed in half by a lunatic. When they saw “Midsommar,” Ari Aster’s violent film about a Swedish pagan cult, they laughed.

“The film’s Scandinavian bacchanal of ritualistic murder,” he writes, “depicted a not unreasonable way to process the grief its protagonist was going through after an unfathomable family tragedy.”
That “mental kink” he has turns the story of a father losing a child into something that Delaney, when he first set out to ruin your day, didn’t expect.
Like Greene’s “The End of the Affair,” Delaney’s book is ultimately about all-encompassing, heart-exploding love. His love for Henry, for his entire family, for the friends and caregivers who rallied around them during hospital stays and procedures, and who sat with Henry so they could try to sleep, or cry.
For Delaney, the pain of a loss that comes from such love is not something be avoided. No one gets a free pass when it comes to grief.
“That doesn’t mean you’re doomed to unhappiness,” he said. “You don’t have to be afraid even though you will forever miss this person, you will forever ache for them. The grief will weave into your life and will be a part of your tapestry. It’ll leave and it’ll come back, but the sooner we get hip to that the sooner we’ll be able to be happy, in snatches, here and there. And that’s OK. That’s life.”

2022-11-13,"One of my most confident, data-based predictions four years ago was that Silicon Valley would grow more influential in the Democratic Party and would move the party to the right on issues related to labor and economic regulation.
I was wrong. The political landscape has completely changed. The Democratic Party has instead become friendlier to labor and increasingly hostile to tech. And Silicon Valley, which since its founding was considered a bastion of progressivism and social liberalism, is moving to the right. The technology industry is the most powerful wealth generation engine in the world, and its products and platforms hold the attention of billions of eyeballs. Given its power and scope, tech could be turning into one of the Democratic Party’s toughest opponents. Although the red wave of 2022 did not materialize, the party still needs to be on the lookout for potential threats.
Take Peter Thiel. An early investor in Facebook, he started out in the early 2010s as a relatively small political donor, focusing his advocacy on libertarian causes and on making the Republican Party more tolerant toward gay rights. This election cycle, Mr. Thiel is one of the G.O.P.’s largest individual donors, giving the bulk of his tens of millions of dollars in donations to Senate candidates and former employees Blake Masters and J.D. Vance. Mr. Vance won his election; both men reiterated Donald Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen.
Elon Musk, once beloved by liberals for electrifying the automobile industry to address climate change, posted (and then deleted) a meme of himself with Kanye West and Mr. Trump. The day before the midterm elections, and mere days after he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, he encouraged his 115 million followers on the platform to support Republicans running for Congress. (Mr. Musk later added that he was an independent and was open to voting for Democrats in the future.) Three weeks ago, an industry newsletter, The Information, reported that the share of Republican-aligned contributions from employees of Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta this election cycle tripled to 15 percent in 2022 from 5 percent in 2020.
The Democrats are a bulwark against existential threats such as climate change and the erosion of democracy. All of our other public-policy debates, ranging from marginal tax rates to education policy, are meaningless without a planet to live on and democratic institutions that provide the rules of the game. In other words, this is the wrong time for the Democrats to be losing one of this country’s most potent constituencies. And while Silicon Valley bears some responsibility for the fracture, blame can also be cast on the party and on the Biden administration, which at some points has gone out of its way to alienate the tech community.
Things were very different in the Obama era, during which time a love affair bloomed between the Democratic Party and the technology industry. President Barack Obama’s win in 2008 was partially credited to his campaign’s ability to harness the power of social media to mobilize and energize young voters. Tech executives like Sheryl Sandberg, then the chief operating officer at Facebook, were praised for both their business successes and their work on social issues. Several alumni of the Obama and Clinton administrations took lucrative positions in companies such as Uber, Airbnb and Amazon.

2022-11-14,"Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, said he would give away most of his money to charity, making him the latest billionaire to pledge to donate his vast fortune during his lifetime.
Mr. Bezos is the world’s fourth-richest person, worth $124 billion, according to Bloomberg. In an interview with CNN released on Monday, Mr. Bezos, appearing with his girlfriend, the former television anchor Lauren Sanchez, said they were making preparations “to be able to give away this money.”
He said he wanted to give in a way that maximized the impact of the donations. “It’s really hard,” he said. “And there are a bunch of ways, I think, that you could do ineffective things.”
It was the first time that Mr. Bezos announced that he would give away the bulk of his wealth. More than 230 of the richest people in the world have promised to donate their money to charitable causes as part of the Giving Pledge, a philanthropy movement started in 2010.

At least as far back as the 19th-century financier George Peabody, many ultrawealthy Americans have given away large shares of their fortunes. Andrew Carnegie famously wrote in his influential 1889 treatise, “The Gospel of Wealth,” that “the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” Like Mr. Bezos at Amazon, Carnegie was frequently criticized for the labor conditions at his company.
The New York Times reported on Monday that Amazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company’s history. Mr. Bezos’ wealth, which as recently as last year was more than $200 billion, according to Bloomberg, has fallen by tens of billions, on paper, because it is closely tied to Amazon’s share price, which has suffered along with other technology stocks this year.
Mr. Bezos, who is the executive chairman of Amazon, stepped down as chief executive in 2021 when he said his goal was “have the time and energy” to focus on his philanthropy and other pursuits. Mr. Bezos also owns The Washington Post and has his own space travel company, Blue Origin.
On Saturday, Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez announced a $100 million grant for the singer and philanthropist Dolly Parton to direct to her chosen charitable causes, as part of an annual gift called the Bezos Award for Courage and Civility. Before Ms. Parton, $100 million awards were given to the chef José Andrés and the CNN commentator and activist Van Jones, announced by Mr. Bezos at the news conference after his trip in July 2021 aboard a rocket sent to outer space by Blue Origin.
In 2020, Mr. Bezos pledged to give $10 billion to combat climate change as part of the Bezos Earth Fund. As part of that commitment, Mr. Bezos pledged $2 billion to restore natural habitats and transform food systems at the climate summit in Glasgow last year. Previously, Mr. Bezos’ largest donation was a $2 billion gift to help homeless families and start preschools.

Mr. Bezos did not give many details in the CNN interview about how he would donate money, but his past efforts might provide some clues, said Stacy Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
“This is a giant statement, not just because of the amount of wealth he has, but because he might really have a ripple effect on what others choose to do,” Ms. Palmer said.
But Mr. Bezos’ comment about giving away his fortune was “not a binding promise,” said Maribel Morey, a philanthropy expert and founding executive director of the Miami Institute for the Social Sciences. “We run to make news of promises, but we actually don’t know if that’s going to materialize.”
In 1999, the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife at the time, Melinda French Gates, helped usher in a new era of billionaire philanthropy with enormous donations to their namesake foundation. Their close friend Warren E. Buffett, the prominent investor, announced in 2006 that he would give a significant slice of his Berkshire Hathaway shares, valued at the time at $31 billion, to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The three then started the Giving Pledge, where billionaires promise to give away at least half their fortunes, as a way to encourage greater generosity among the world’s richest people.
Other signatories have included Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor of New York; Mr. Gates’s Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen; and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan. There are 236 pledgers across 28 countries, according to the Giving Pledge’s website.

Mr. Bezos has been criticized for not signing the Giving Pledge. His ex-wife, the author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, signed the pledge in 2019 after their divorce, vowing to “keep at it until the safe is empty.”
Ms. Scott, who is estimated by Bloomberg to be worth $24 billion, has already met the Giving Pledge threshold by giving away more than half her fortune — and she has done it in less than three and half years since first publishing her promise on the group’s website.
She has donated more than $14 billion to causes ranging from education to mental health. Ms. Scott, who recently filed for divorce from her second husband, has given to more than 1,500 groups.
Ms. Scott’s rapid, prolific giving is at times compared with Mr. Bezos’ own philanthropy, often to his detriment. Last month, Mr. Bezos visited the Vatican to receive a philanthropy award even though, many observers noted, his ex-wife had given away more money than he had. Unlike Mr. Bezos, who appears at events and gives speeches highlighting his giving, Ms. Scott has maintained a low profile, refusing all interviews on the subject and restricting her comments to essays that she posts on the website Medium.
On Monday, Ms. Scott released her latest essay, noting that over the past seven months she had given nearly $2 billion to 343 organizations. Some of those gifts, like $122.6 million to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, had been previously announced. Others, like a $15 million gift to the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, were first revealed in the post. Like many of her gifts, the donation to the 83-year-old nonprofit group, which supports refugees and migrants entering the United States, was the largest in its history.
Ms. Scott began her latest essay with a poem by Gwen Nell Westerman that she said “inspires me by shutting me up every time I read it.”"
2022-11-15,"Walmart on Tuesday reported a rise in sales in its latest quarter, signaling that consumers continued to spend despite high inflation and that the retail behemoth had moved past the missteps that plagued it earlier this year. It also increased its full-year forecast for revenue and profit, and projected confidence by announcing a $20 billion share buyback.
The retailer’s sales in the United States increased 8.2 percent in the third quarter versus the same period last year, comfortably beating analysts’ estimates. Revenue for the quarter rose to nearly $153 billion, also more than expected.
Walmart’s stock jumped 6.5 percent on Tuesday, its biggest one-day increase since 2020. Shares of other major retailers, like Amazon and Target, also rose.
Walmart said in August that its customers were feeling the effects of inflation and changing their shopping habits accordingly. Doug McMillon, the company’s chief executive, said the retailer was adjusting to that reality. As the prices of food and gas increased, shoppers pulled back on discretionary spending for items like clothes and knickknacks for the home. That left Walmart with excess inventory that it had to get rid of at a loss.
“We’re being thoughtful and balanced about inventory levels by category and expenses as we work through the fourth quarter and position ourselves for next year,” Mr. McMillon said on Tuesday on a call with analysts.
At its stores in the United States, Walmart said, the overall number of transactions and the average amount a shopper spent per trip increased in the third quarter, suggesting that high inflation did not deter consumers as much as some had feared.

2022-11-16,"SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt — Long after other world leaders had departed the United Nations climate talks in Egypt, Brazil’s president-elect arrived — and electrified the gathering.
Enthusiasm was palpable here for Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known simply as Lula to most. He recently defeated Jair Bolsonaro, a man Brazilian environmentalists describe as a “nightmare” for presiding over four years of rampant deforestation and lax enforcement of laws in the country’s vast and fragile Amazon rainforest.
Mr. Lula addressed the summit’s attendees amid exuberant supporters who serenaded him with a version of the celebratory chant “Ole, ole, ole!” His main message: “Brazil is leaving its cocoon where it was for the last four years.”
“I am here to say to all of you here that Brazil is back in the world,” he said at an event alongside governors of the country’s Amazonian states.

It was Mr. Lula’s first trip outside Brazil since winning the presidential election at the end of October, and he basked in the optimism many people here feel now that a defender of an ecosystem that is crucial to the global climate is back in power. This is Mr. Lula’s second time as president; he led Brazil from 2003 to 2010. He will take office on Jan. 1.
“It’s just a huge, huge relief,” Mercedes Bustamante, an ecologist and professor at the University of Brasília, said. “Bolsonaro was a disaster. Climate agenda was completely paralyzed.”
Mr. Lula’s appearance at the summit comes as negotiators for nearly every nation in the world try to iron out an agreement on how to implement the pledges most have made to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are dangerously heating the planet.
Being invited to the summit before inauguration, Mr. Lula said in a speech later on Wednesday, was “an acknowledgment that the world is in a rush to see Brazil participating once again in the discussion of the future of the planet and all the human beings that live on it.”
His speech did not contain any major announcements, but it didn’t have to. He declared that he intended to make Brazil a force to combat climate change, drawing sustained applause from the assembled delegates and observers. After his speech, the president-elect was swarmed by well-wishers who wanted to take selfies with him.

Mr. Lula’s history of clamping down on deforestation is what gives many of his supporters at the summit high expectations for his next term as president.
When he became president for the first time in 2003, Amazon deforestation was at one of its highest rates ever. By the end of his second term, in 2010, the rate of deforestation had dropped by 67 percent.
But under Mr. Bolsonaro, that trend reversed and the Amazon lost over 13,000 square miles of tree cover from 2019 to 2021, according to the National Institute of Space Research in Brazil.

Brazil had been set to host the annual U.N. climate summit in 2019, but Mr. Bolsonaro refused to go through with it. On Wednesday, Mr. Lula proposed holding the 2025 summit in one of Brazil’s Amazonian cities. At his speech, he wore his lucky tie, the same one he wore when Brazil was selected to host the 2016 Olympic Games.

On Tuesday night, Mr. Lula met separately with John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, and Xie Zhenhua, Mr. Kerry’s Chinese counterpart. The United States is the greatest historic emitter of greenhouse gases, while China is currently the top polluting country in the world. Brazil is among the top 10 biggest emitters, as well as one of the top 10 oil producers.
The United States and European countries have been pressuring the governments of large developing economies like Brazil to reduce their emissions more rapidly. In response, Brazil and others have demanded that industrialized countries help fund the transition of developing nations from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
Climate change, Mr. Lula said in his Wednesday speech, was “a problem created disproportionately by the rich countries of the world.”
Mr. Lula said wealthy nations like the United States and those in the European Union must deliver on the 2015 pledge they made to give $100 billion annually to developing nations to help them transition to wind, solar and other clean energy. “My comeback is to demand what was promised in 2015,” Mr. Lula told the gathering.

On Monday, the three countries that are home to more than half of the world’s tropical rainforests — Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo — formally announced an alliance to protect their forests and called for both public and private funding from around the world.
The plan has no financial backing of its own and was more of a call to action than a strategy for how to achieve its goals.
In Brazil, Mr. Lula faces a political landscape that is far more polarized than it was when he last served as president. The largest bloc in the country’s incoming congress is still controlled by Mr. Bolsonaro’s allies.
He will find more resistance from agribusiness, mining interests and others who were allowed to do what they wanted under Bolsonaro,” Ms. Bustamante said. “Deforestation has now become much more tied to organized crime in the Amazon region.”
Some of Mr. Lula’s fiercest critics are now in the Amazon, where local leaders who have profited from weakened enforcement of environmental laws under Mr. Bolsonaro protested his victory.

“It’s a challenging situation, but not an impossible one,” said Adriana Abdenur, who runs Plataforma CIPÓ, a Brazilian environmental policy organization. “Revitalizing environmental agencies and providing better funding for enforcement can be done largely without congress.”
For now, Mr. Lula’s rhetoric around climate policy largely revolves around slowing deforestation in the Amazon, or even reversing it and reforesting parts of it. The Amazon absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and its trees and soil store hundreds of billions of metric tons more.
Scientists have described a looming tipping point, however, when enough deforestation has occurred that the region’s climate shifts and begins to dry out, turning it into a net carbon dioxide emitter.
Mr. Lula pledged to fight against illegal logging and mining in the Amazon “without truce.”
“The mere fact we’ll have a president who doesn’t openly endorse the criminal destruction of the Amazon — you know, a willful expansion of environmental crime — there is surely reason to believe it will have an effect,” Ms. Abdenur said. “It will matter.”"
2022-11-17,"The attorney general for the District of Columbia filed a civil complaint against the Washington Commanders on Thursday, accusing the team of failing to refund hundreds of thousands of dollars in season ticket deposits to fans.
It was the second complaint filed against the team by Karl Racine, the attorney general, and came a week after the first civil complaint accused the Commanders, team owner Dan Snyder, the N.F.L. and Commissioner Roger Goodell of misrepresenting their efforts to address decades of sexual harassment and abuse of women who worked for the team.
“The Commanders’ arrogance and blatant disregard for the law is a slap in the face to District residents who have supported the team for decades,” Racine said in a statement Thursday.
In the complaint, the attorney general alleged that the team misrepresented the terms of returning customers’ security deposits, saying that their money would be refunded within 30 days after their season-ticket contracts expired. The team, the attorney general said, failed to disclose that it would hold those security deposits indefinitely unless the season-ticket holders followed an “undisclosed, extra-contractual policy” requiring them to submit a signed written request for their deposit to be returned.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The omission, the complaint said, “tended to mislead consumers and is an unlawful trade practice.”
In a statement, the team said it had hired an outside law firm and forensic auditors that “found no evidence that the team intentionally withheld security deposits that should have been returned to customers or that the team improperly converted any unclaimed deposits to revenue.”
The team said that in 2014, managers were told to send notices to more than 1,400 customers with deposits and returned all security deposits requested.
The N.F.L. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Racine said he was seeking a court order to force the Commanders to stop these practices and pay back ticket holders who live in Washington, his jurisdiction, as well as financial penalties for the team for violating consumer-protection laws.
According to the complaint, the team has been withholding security deposits as far back as 1996. Over the years, some fans have been repaid, but many former season-ticket holders who live in the District are still owed hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Together, the two civil lawsuits brought in Washington add to the mounting legal inquiries of Snyder, who faces at least five open investigations, including one led by the attorney general for the state of Virginia.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Commanders are headquartered in Virginia and play their home games in Maryland, but they draw on residents of those two states and Washington as ticket buyers and employees.
Racine in recent years has opened cases against Facebook and Amazon, joined other attorneys general in suing Google over privacy practices and brought a federal lawsuit against the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers over their roles in the Jan. 6 insurrection.
His complaints related to the Commanders could each result in potentially millions of dollars of penalties. In the first complaint, if a jury determined that the league and the team had lied about their investigation into sexual harassment at the organization, they could be fined “up to $5,000” for each instance in which they misrepresented their efforts.
Courts have broad discretion to determine what constitutes a violation.
In contrast with Racine’s earlier suit, damages in the consumer-protection lawsuit filed on Thursday are more easily quantifiable because it seeks to identify money that may have been withheld from Washington consumers and other businesses.
The charges in the complaint on Thursday were originally brought to light in a hearing held by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which began an investigation of the team in October 2021. Republican leaders announced on Thursday that the inquiry would be shelved early next year after the party gained control of the House of Representatives.

Numerous former team employees spoke to the congressional committee at a round table in February, including Jason Friedman, who for 24 years worked in the team’s ticketing office.
He accused the team of keeping “two sets of books” in order to conceal hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue that was supposed to be shared with all 32 N.F.L. franchises. He also claimed that the team had not properly refunded as much as $5 million in refundable security deposits to season-ticket holders.
In April, the House committee referred the allegations involving potential ticket fraud to the Federal Trade Commission. According to an ESPN report, the U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia is also looking into claims of financial malfeasance made against the team. The team has denied the charges and sent the F.T.C. 102 pages of support documents to disprove the allegations. The F.T.C. has not commented on its investigation.
The allegations made to Congress prompted the N.F.L. to hire Mary Jo White, an attorney and former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to begin a new investigation into the Commanders and Snyder.
The problems facing Snyder and the Commanders, combined with the poor performance of the team on the field and the league’s lowest attendance, have irked the N.F.L.’s other owners, who have privately discussed ousting Snyder. Twenty-four of the 32 team owners would have to vote to remove Snyder, a step that has never been taken in the N.F.L.’s more than 100-year history.
Two weeks ago, Daniel and Tanya Snyder announced that they had hired bankers to explore all options for selling some or all of the team."

“Hard core” Twitter in disarray
No, Twitter is not dead this morning, despite #RIPTwitter trending on the social network last night. But its future looks more turbulent than at any point since Elon Musk took over three weeks ago, as a huge number of workers decided to quit rather than agree to the billionaire’s loyalty pledge, which involved committing to a “hard core” work routine to grow the platform.
The newly shrunken Twitter now faces numerous questions, including about its ability to maintain mission-critical systems, police content on its platform, remain in compliance with regulatory agreements and, frankly, stay afloat while laboring under a huge amount of debt.
Hundreds of employees have resigned, some even before Musk’s 5 p.m. Eastern pledge deadline took effect. The apparent feeling: better to take three months’ severance pay than to work under a leader who has demanded long hours and fired dozens of employees who had criticized him, some publicly. A poll of nearly 250 employees conducted on Blind, an anonymized social network for tech workers, suggested that nearly three-quarters favored leaving Twitter.
As the company did when it laid off half its work force, Twitter locked its offices and disabled employee badge access until Monday.

Mr. Musk appears to have underestimated how many people would leave. Though he may have viewed his ultimatum as a way to weed out disaffected workers and cut costs, Twitter’s leadership instead spent time on Thursday trying to convince “critical” employees that they should stay.
Mr. Musk also backtracked on a ban on remote work, at least somewhat. He told employees on Thursday that they could work remotely, so long as their managers certified they were making “an excellent contribution.” But he also warned said managers not to lie about that, or risk being “exited from the company.” (The edict came after a former employee sued the company over Musk’s remote-working ban, arguing it was discriminatory against those with disabilities.)
The resignations haven’t dimmed Musk’s joking on Twitter. He tweeted, “We just hit another all-time high in Twitter usage lol” and posted several memes about the chaos.
But many of Twitter’s problems aren’t laughing matters. Among those who have left were members of the trust and public safety teams and critical engineering teams. “Every mistake in code and operations is now deadly,” a former engineer told The Washington Post. Meanwhile, seven Democratic senators on Thursday urged the F.T.C. to investigate whether Twitter had remained in compliance with a 2011 consumer privacy settlement.
None of this chaos is likely to reassure either the scores of advertisers who have paused campaigns on the platform since Musk took over, or the banks who extended $13 billion in loans to help finance his takeover and are counting on him to pay $1 billion in interest each year.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Nancy Pelosi steps aside. The California representative, the first woman to serve as House speaker and a dominant force in Democratic politics for more than two decades, said on Thursday that she would not pursue a leadership role in the new Congress, when Republicans take control of the chamber. Her likely successor as Democratic leader is Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York.
The World Cup is set to begin with a U-turn on beer. The authorities in Qatar, the host country, said on Friday that they would allow only nonalcoholic drinks at the tournament, just two days before competition starts. The move complicates FIFA’s $75 million sponsorship deal with Budweiser and is the latest controversy to hit the event, after criticism of Qatar’s human-rights record.
COP27 may end with a whimper. The two-week gathering of nations to discuss climate change solutions is likely to end on Friday with little agreement on matters like compensating poorer countries for climate disasters and the phasing out of fossil fuels. António Gutteres, the U.N. secretary general, cited a “breakdown of trust.”
Elizabeth Holmes will be sentenced on Friday. The Theranos founder faces up to 20 years in prison after being convicted of defrauding investors. Holmes has asked for 18 months of house arrest instead; court filings also note that she is pregnant with her second child.
Masa Son owes nearly $5 billion to SoftBank. The tech mogul now owes $4.7 billion to the investment giant he founded, as the plunging value of tech companies has left him underwater on loans SoftBank extended him to invest in its funds, The Financial Times reports. Son isn’t obligated to repay those loans anytime soon.

The tiny Bahamas looms large in the future of FTX
A turf war between the United States and Bahamas could make it harder for a parade of international creditors to claw back the billions owed to them following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. The tiny island nation, where FTX is headquartered, believes it has the upper hand over how the firm will be wound down after the Securities Commission of the Bahamas took control of much of its digital assets and questioned the legitimacy of bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.
ADVERTISEMENT

The jurisdictional tug of war emerged after John Jay Ray III, FTX’s new C.E.O. who is pushing for the company to be wound down in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, slammed the company’s management (which happened to raise $1.9 billion from the giants of Silicon Valley and Wall Street). Mr. Ray, whose résumé includes overseeing the $23 billion Enron bankruptcy, said he had never seen “such a complete failure of corporate control.” The lowlights: Expenses approved by emoji and billions of dollars in losses, but no paper trail. Where were the auditors? The blame game has already begun.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
In Thursday’s bankruptcy filing, Mr. Ray grumbled that Bahmanian authorities had gained “unauthorized access” to FTX assets, in an effort “to undermine” the Chapter 11 proceedings. He also suggested that Sam Bankman-Fried, the firm’s founder, who is known as S.B.F., helped them.

S.B.F. was (unusually) quiet on Thursday. The 30-year-old, who is under investigation by the Justice Department and S.E.C. for, among other things, lending customer money to his trading unit, Alameda Research, stayed off Twitter. The silence followed a series of tweets and a bizarrely candid interview with Vox this week, in which S.B.F. took a shot at regulators for “making everything worse,” and admitted to “messy accounting.” One big development: S.B.F. has a new legal team, Semafor reports, that includes David Wills, who teaches at Stanford Law School — Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents are also Stanford professors.
The list of FTX’s 50 biggest creditors is scheduled to come out on Friday. Meanwhile, contagion fears are growing.Following a run on customer deposits, FTX closed last week and S.B.F. resigned, triggering a broad sell-off in digital assets in recent days. The volatility has struck the likes of Genesis, a cryptocurrency lender, which, according to The Wall Street Journal, sought a $1 billion emergency loan before suspending withdrawals. And Multicoin, a crypto venture fund that has funds tied up in FTX, warned investors that “many trading firms will be wiped out and shut down” following the collapse of FTX and Alameda.
Swifties versus Ticketmaster
Today was supposed to be when the general public could start buying tickets for Taylor Swift’s first tour in five years. But Ticketmaster called off the sale on Thursday, citing “extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet that demand.”
It was an extraordinary admission — and made the live-event giant an antihero to Swift fans and regulators alike.
ADVERTISEMENT

“It’s a function of Taylor Swift,” Greg Maffei, the chairman of Ticketmaster’s parent company, told CNBC on Thursday. What happened: Ticketmaster’s systems crashed on Tuesday, when it opened up presales through its Verified Fan program, which is meant to weed out bots and speculators. (It received 3.5 billion requests.) “The site was supposed to open up for 1.5 million verified Taylor Swift fans. We had 14 million people hit the site, including bots, which are not supposed to be there.”
Meanwhile, fans complained that tickets were appearing on secondary markets like StubHub at much higher prices. (Top-tier tickets for a show in the New York City area were going for nearly $5,000 this morning.)
It adds gasoline to antitrust criticisms of Ticketmaster. Bad blood between the company and regulators has been around since it merged with Live Nation in 2010. Attorneys general in North Carolina and Tennessee are investigating the presale troubles, while Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, questioned whether Ticketmaster “continues to abuse its market positions.”
“The previous owners were not good stewards for the business, and obviously it presented risks in terms of information.”

S.E.C.’s Gensler talks climate disclosure
The value of assets labeled “E.S.G.” reached $35 trillion in 2020, and will grow to $41 trillion by the end of this year, according to Deutsche Bank. But company reporting on environmental, social and governance issues varies widely, and rating agencies apply different standards, making it difficult to compare data and draw meaningful conclusions. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule to standardize climate-related disclosures made by public companies. DealBook talked with S.E.C. chairman Gary Gensler about the proposed changes. The interview has been edited.
Your predecessor, Jay Clayton, recently said that the S.E.C. should not be engineering the world’s carbon transition. Is that what the climate rule aims to do?
Literally, hundreds and hundreds of companies are currently making disclosures around climate risk. And investors are using that information to make investment decisions. So it’s about how to bring some consistency and comparability to it. How to guard against misleading disclosures or greenwashing.

It’s been reported that the agency may cut Scope 3 monitoring requirements — which address emissions that businesses don’t directly control further along their supply chain. Is that right?
On Scope 3, we have heard from commenters across [many sectors]. There are letters from the agricultural community about how they sell their produce, and how that might affect them. That is not what we’re trying to do here. This is about disclosure for public companies.
I can’t prejudge where it all will lead. I do think that we have a real role here.
Is there a timeline to finalize the rule?
We now have approaching 15,000 comments. We’ve never had so many comments on any rule in the history of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And when the staff’s ready to serve something up, we’ll try to address it.

2022-11-19,"Now that Elon Musk’s takeover has hastened the demise of Twitter, many are grasping for alternatives to their beloved town square. Mastodon, Cohost and Koo have all been floated as options. But I won’t bother joining any of those. Instead, you can find me on Facebook.
This probably sounds strange. Far from its origins as a hot-or-not rating system for Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard classmates, Facebook conquered the world — but then devolved into a cesspool of privacy violations and misinformation. Between its failure to detect election misinformation, its inability to contain hate speech and its gleeful collection of personal data without users’ full understanding, many now see Facebook not just as a graying social media site but also as the nexus of an evil empire.
Facebook, still the world’s biggest social network with over two billion active users per month, has been in slow decline for years. A forecast by eMarketer predicts a decrease of 1.4 million users this year. By next year, fewer than 15 percent of its users will be under the age of 25. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, just announced its most significant layoff ever: more than 11,000 people. But in its decline, Facebook has become one of the most absurd, uncanny and therefore enjoyable places on the internet.
A consummate millennial, I joined Facebook in 2007 — the year I graduated high school — when it was still a place to blithely make weekend plans on one another’s public “walls” and trade perplexing romantic overtures known as “pokes.” Over the past 15 years I have watched Facebook metastasize from a place that could form the basis of Sheryl Sandberg’s credibility in “Lean In” into one where the only conceivable reason people my age log in is to revisit photos from one’s indie sleaze party era or determine which high school classmates now support Donald Trump.

While Facebook is still a thriving, active social network for the over-45 set, for my cohort a mass exodus has left it the digital equivalent of an Old Western ghost town where tumbleweeds blow across an arid landscape.

What’s Up? (Nov. 13-19)
Crypto Chaos
In the course of days, the collapse of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, has led to a series of revelations — about the corporate dysfunction inside FTX, the entangled personal lives of the people who ran it and what the exchange’s new leader said appeared to be efforts to “conceal the misuse of customer funds.” The company has filed for bankruptcy, and federal prosecutors are now investigating what happened to the lost funds of possibly more than one million creditors. The downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former chief executive of FTX, has called into question the future of the crypto industry as well as that of a closely affiliated movement in which he heavily invested. That movement was centered on a moral philosophy known as effective altruism, and it financed itself in large part with donations from FTX’s philanthropic arm.
11 Years for Elizabeth Holmes
Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison on Friday, after being convicted on four counts of defrauding investors about the technology and business practices of Theranos, her failed blood-testing start-up. It was a lighter sentence than the maximum 20 years in prison she faced but still far tougher than the 18 months of house arrest her lawyers had sought. The decision was delivered by the same judge who oversaw Ms. Holmes’s trial last year, and in making it, he considered a cache of letters and documents filed by lawyers and prosecutors for the case. Included among them were family photos of Ms. Holmes, her partner, Billy Evans, and their son, as well as comments from figures like Senator Cory Booker, who praised Ms. Holmes’s “determination to make a difference.” Her critics viewed the case as an opportunity to send a message to other tech founders who may distort the truth in their quest for success in an industry where few executives are ever found guilty of fraud.
Twitter Turmoil, Continued
Given the ultimatum to leave Elon Musk’s Twitter or to stay at the company and “build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0,” some 1,200 employees appeared to choose to go on Thursday. They tendered their resignations hours before the 5 p.m. Eastern deadline that Mr. Musk set the day before in an email with the subject line, “A Fork in the Road.” The remaining staff, Mr. Musk wrote, would have to be “extremely hard core” and work long hours at a high intensity. Because the departures came on the heels of mass layoffs of about half of the company’s employees, there are growing questions about how the site will hold up. Vast swaths of Twitter’s work force have been eliminated, like the communications department, which no longer exists, and the platform’s infrastructure teams, which are virtually nonexistent. On Friday, Mr. Musk asked “anyone who actually writes software” to report to the 10th floor of Twitter’s headquarters.

What’s Next? (Nov. 20-26)
Let the Shopping Begin
There is much to suggest that despite the crushing inflation consumers experienced this year, many intend to shop enthusiastically this holiday season. Retail sales rose 1.3 percent last month, beating expectations, as retailers like Amazon, Target and Kohl’s offered earlier-than-usual holiday deals. The rise in sales coincided with the first signs of moderating inflation: In October, prices climbed 7.7 percent from a year earlier, still a quick pace but down from 8.2 percent in September. But shoppers’ zeal for holiday sales indicated that they were looking for discounts, adding to the pressure on retailers — who not that long ago wielded more power to price products as they pleased — to lower prices. At Target, for example, demand tapered off when those sales ended. What has changed from last season? Consumers had more money saved in 2021, and were spending on clothes and electronics as they emerged from pandemic lockdowns. This year, customers have been much more worried about rising prices and have cut down on discretionary spending.

A Look at the Fed’s Thinking
The Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its November meeting this week, providing potential clues about whether policymakers intend to slow the pace of interest rate increases. Earlier this month, the Fed raised rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, the fourth consecutive increase of that size, and sent some mixed messages about the path ahead as it explained the decision. While the central bank said in a policy statement that officials would soon slow down the rate increases, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, later said at a news conference it was “very premature” to consider a pause, keeping the Fed’s options open for its next move.
Rail Unions Vote
Two large rail unions are expected to vote this week on the tentative agreement that was struck in September to avert a strike that would have thrown already mangled supply chains into chaos, worsened inflation and disrupted travel. The possibility of that strike still looms: Rail workers and their employers have been at odds over unrelenting and unpredictable schedules, and strict attendance policies that make it difficult to attend to personal matters, like doctor appointments, or risk penalties. And some workers don’t see many gains on those fronts in the proposed agreement, which added only a single day of paid personal leave. A few unions have already rejected it. The votes this week will not decide whether a strike is likely in December, but they will offer a sense of whether opposition to the contract is beginning to crystallize.
What Else?
Amazon plans to lay off about 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs, adding to the string of layoffs in the tech industry. Inflation in Britain reached 11.1 percent in October from a year earlier. Workers at dozens of Starbucks locations went on a one-day strike on Thursday, protesting what they said are anti-union tactics from the company."

2022-11-22,"The New York City Council voted on Tuesday to approve another major housing development in a sign that elected officials are increasingly willing to work with the real estate industry to address the city’s urgent housing crisis.
The project, a massive $2 billion development known as Innovation Queens, will span five city blocks and add more than 3,000 homes in Astoria.
The proposal had been enmeshed in weeks of contentious negotiations, as New York City once again found itself grappling with compelling, but competing interests: How to balance the critical need for housing against neighborhood concerns of affordability and gentrification.
Major proposals, like a rezoning of Industry City in Brooklyn and a proposed new headquarters for Amazon in Queens, were thwarted in recent years; and earlier this year, a project in Harlem to build 900 apartments died after the local council member opposed it.

Innovation Queens seemed headed for a similar fate, with the local council member, Julie Won, opposing the plan because she said it did not call for enough affordable housing, especially for people at the lowest income levels. She was supported by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district includes Astoria.
But the developers and the city’s housing department agreed to double the allotment of affordable housing units to 1,400, or about 45 percent of the project.
Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who took office in January, has supported the project and other recent housing plans in Throgs Neck in the Bronx and Halletts Point in Queens that were approved by the City Council after facing opposition from local council members.
“This is exactly the kind of historic work we must do to tackle the housing shortage at the root of our affordable housing crisis,” Mr. Adams said.

But even as elected officials celebrated the victory, there were growing concerns that the city was moving too slowly to address the housing crisis and that Mr. Adams was not creating affordable housing quickly enough.
While the Adams administration is pushing changes that could make it easier to build, like relaxing requirements that new buildings provide parking spaces, it is also grappling with a staffing crisis at key departments that oversee housing. Rents have risen sharply this year, interest rates are rising and a major tax incentive for developers expired in Albany.
Mr. Adams announced a soccer stadium deal in Queens last week that is expected to create 2,500 units of affordable housing. But that housing is not expected to be completed until 2030, and the Innovation Queens project could take a decade to fully complete, though some sections could be finished sooner.
The city’s efforts to build affordable housing have been anemic. Officials were only able to start construction or preservation of about 16,000 below-market-rate homes in the most recent fiscal year ending in June — almost half of the number it averaged in the prior four years.
“We’ve seen the city’s housing production decrease by 43 percent just in one year alone,” said Rachel Fee, the executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a nonprofit advocacy group. “There are real significant challenges ahead.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Still, Ms. Fee said the Queens project’s approval should be viewed as a win.
“We really need the Council to be working with the Adams administration and really taking a hard look at what the other opportunities are across the city,” she said.
The 51-seat City Council has an unspoken tradition, known as member deference, that allows a council member to effectively veto land-use proposals in their district. The City Council speaker, Adrienne E. Adams, has signaled that she is open to ending the practice, saying that she values community input, but not “irrational opposition that rejects desperately needed housing.”
Ms. Adams said on Tuesday that it was important to weigh each neighborhood’s needs when deciding how to shape projects like Innovation Queens.
“We knew this was a critical project that had the opportunity to create many units of affordable housing,” she said. “It was not something the City Council could fail to try negotiating.”
Ms. Won, who is part of the Council’s progressive caucus, had opposed the project, which lies between 35th and 36th Avenues, just north of Northern Boulevard. But she announced her support on Monday after developers agreed to build more than 1,400 affordable units — roughly 45 percent of the total — and double the 700 units they initially proposed.

“From Day 1, I have stood with my community in demanding deeper affordability from this development,” Ms. Won said.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a left-leaning Democrat who represents Queens and the Bronx, said that concessions from the developers sent a “strong message that when it comes to new housing, our neighborhoods do not have to settle for crumbs of affordability.”
Jay Martin, a partner at BedRock Real Estate Partners, which is one of the project’s developers, said on Tuesday that “the city’s housing crisis will not be solved by the public sector or the private sector alone.” The other developers are Silverstein Properties and Kaufman Astoria Studios.
Housing has become an increasingly pressing issue in New York City — part of a national housing shortage in which Americans are struggling to afford homes.

A typical household spends almost 35 percent of its income on rent, up from less than 30 percent in the mid 2000s. The median rent on newly leased apartments in Manhattan reached a record of $4,000 this year. Homelessness also reached a record level at more than 61,000 people.
Many of the city’s problems, including the high cost of living, stem from the shortage. The New York metropolitan area needed more than 340,000 additional homes in 2019, according to a May estimate from Up for Growth, a Washington policy and research group. The shortage is most acute for lower-income New Yorkers, many of whom are spending more than half their income on housing.
Mayor Adams released his housing plan over the summer, but he declined to provide a specific goal for affordable units. His predecessor, Bill de Blasio, made investing in affordable housing a cornerstone of his efforts to reduce inequality, and his administration preserved or built more than 200,000 affordable homes, including about 30,000 in the 2020 fiscal year.
The Adams administration has seen thousands of city employees quit, which has slowed work at agencies. The city’s work force declined by 19,000 employees over the last two years, according to a recent report by the state comptroller, which found that the vacancy rate at the Buildings Department was nearly 25 percent.
Drawings of the project include glass buildings, public parks, a playground and a “community hub” for nonprofits. But some took issue with the inclusion of Gucci and Chanel stores in those drawings, fearing that it would become another neighborhood for the wealthy.

Ms. Won said in a television interview on NY1 last month that there were more than 20 homeless shelters in her district and huge demand for affordable housing.
“There’s more parking spots being offered by this than affordable units,” she said."
2022-11-23,"“Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,” the much-anticipated follow-up to the 2019 sleeper hit directed by Rian Johnson, was supposed to be the moment Netflix crossed the Rubicon.
Rather than give the film a perfunctory theatrical release — a strategy designed to ensure most viewers ultimately watch a movie on the streaming service — Netflix, in a first, would give the film a traditional, exclusive run in a large number of cinemas.
It didn’t happen.
After much back and forth, and contrary to the wishes of some Netflix employees and Mr. Johnson, a theatrical release for “Glass Onion” that at one point some people inside the company hoped would reach up to 2,000 screens ended up at 638 in the United States. The movie, which was released on Wednesday and has received positive reviews, will run in theaters for just one week before becoming available on Netflix on Dec. 23.
What was supposed to be the moment to prove the value of theaters to the streaming giant will not come to pass. Yet the company is also involved in another intriguing theatrical experiment this weekend, one that could end up providing Netflix with even more valuable feedback.

On Friday, “Matilda the Musical,” financed and produced by Netflix, will open on more than 1,500 screens in 670 locations across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The movie, starring Emma Thompson as the villainous Miss Trunchbull, will be released and promoted by Sony Pictures, which, in a unique one-picture deal, licensed the rights to Netflix on the condition that Sony could hold onto the United Kingdom for a theatrical release. (“Matilda,” which is based on a stage musical that itself is based on a children’s book by Roald Dahl, is beloved in the United Kingdom. The musical has been running in London’s West End since 2011.)
“It will be a good example of what could be done,” said Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of Vue International, a London-based exhibitor with theaters in countries including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany and Italy. “If there was ever a film made for the big screen, it’s ‘Matilda.’”
Sony Pictures, which declined to comment for this article, bought the film rights to “Matilda the Musical” in 2015, with the show’s director, Matthew Warchus, set to oversee the adaptation. At the same time, Netflix was trying to bolster its roster of family films and had its eye on the Roald Dahl estate. (In 2021, Netflix ultimately purchased the entire Dahl estate, giving the company the ability to adapt books like “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “The BFG” into films and television shows, while also controlling the publishing rights.)
At the end of 2019, the companies entered into an arrangement whereby Netflix would finance “Matilda the Musical” and produce it in conjunction with Sony and Working Title Films, a U.K. producer. Netflix would control rights to the finished product worldwide, excluding the United Kingdom and Ireland, where Sony would own the rights and release the film theatrically. “Matilda the Musical” will not appear on Netflix in the United Kingdom or Ireland until next summer, though it will be available to stream in the United States and other countries on Christmas.

So far the film has received positive reviews. The Independent deemed it “a frothy, whimsical delight,” while The Guardian called it “a tangy bit of entertainment, served up with gusto.” It has a 100 percent positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes and could do the kind of business that the original “Peter Rabbit” did at the British box office, where it sold $54 million in tickets.

Whether the box office performances of “Glass Onion” and “Matilda” have any long-term impact on Netflix’s approach to theatrical distribution is a big question. According to three people with knowledge of Netflix’s inner workings, numerous executives in the company’s film group would like Netflix to embrace a more traditional strategy regarding film releases, but the co-chief executives, Ted Sarandos and Reed Hastings, remain focused on streaming. “There is no question internally that we make our movies for our members, and we really want them to see them on Netflix,” Mr. Sarandos said on an earnings call last month, adding, “Most people watch movies at home.”
Netflix declined to comment for this article.
Discussions about a significant theatrical release for Netflix’s biggest movies began in earnest in April, after the company’s stock dropped 35 percent following a dismal first-quarter earnings report, according to the three people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal matters. “Glass Onion,” one of two “Knives Out” sequels the company purchased for $450 million in 2021, seemed to be the perfect candidate. The original grossed an impressive $165 million domestically — a notable feat for a movie not based on any well-known intellectual property.
Spencer Klein, the company’s distribution director, went to the theater owners’ trade convention in Las Vegas to inform eager exhibitors that in light of Netflix’s subscriber slowdown, the company was considering wider theatrical releases. The issue was again brought up at a retreat for senior management in May and discussions continued in June, the people said, when there were preliminary talks about pushing back the streaming debut of the action-adventure film “The Gray Man” to allow for additional time in theaters. (This idea, specifically, never gained much traction.)
Each conversation ended the same way, the three people said, with Mr. Sarandos adamant that a theatrical model was a confusing distraction and that the company’s best films should debut on Netflix. It wasn’t until September that Mr. Sarandos re-engaged in the debate, allowing his film team to use “Glass Onion” to test the market to examine two things: whether big-budget Netflix films could make money in theaters, even with the added marketing and print costs required; and whether those additional marketing costs would ultimately improve the film’s performance on the streaming platform.

Scott Stuber, Netflix’s film chief, was hoping to put “Glass Onion” into a wide release, anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 screens, according to the people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Sarandos wanted 500. They agreed to more than 600 with a 30-day window between the film’s theatrical debut and its appearance on streaming. Mr. Sarandos demanded that it play for just one week and that the exhibitors promise not to release the box office numbers to the news media. For the first time, the two largest theater chains in the United States, AMC Theatres and Regal Cinemas, agreed to a deal with Netflix, along with other smaller chains. AMC’s chief executive, Adam Aron, said in a statement at the time that the deal showed that “both theatrical exhibitors and streamers can continue to coexist successfully.”
That enthusiasm was short-lived, stifled when Mr. Sarandos emphasized his commitment to streaming during last month’s earnings call.
Some of the large exhibitors were considering backing out of the deal after his remarks, according to one of the people familiar with the company’s inner workings. They remained only because they hoped a success story would change the top executives’ thinking. It helped that Netflix had committed a healthy budget to marketing “Glass Onion,” running commercials during “Sunday Night Football” and “Saturday Night Live,” and showing the trailer in theaters before movies like “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and “Ticket to Paradise.”
“We want as many people as possible to see it in theaters,” Mr. Johnson, the director of “Glass Onion,” told The Hollywood Reporter this week about the film. “And then we want it to do incredibly well when it hits Netflix — so lots of people see it and so it demonstrates to everybody, most of all Netflix, that these two things can coexist.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Sarandos’s thinking runs counter to what other major studio heads now believe.
“I’ve seen the data,” David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Media Discovery, said during a recent investor conference. “A movie that opens in the theater performs five times as well as a movie that you put direct to streaming.”
Yet, releasing films theatrically is far from a sure thing these days. The U.S. box office is down some 32 percent compared with 2019, and the pandemic significantly altered moviegoing habits. Older moviegoers have yet to return to the cinema in big numbers, and studios are making fewer films, 36 percent fewer, in fact. One exhibitor said that if the three big streaming companies — Netflix, Amazon and Apple — released roughly 20 movies in theaters each year in total, that would help make up for the deficit and potentially return the business to a healthy place.
Until then, theater chains are hopeful that releases like “Glass Onion” and “Matilda” will convince the companies to try more like them.
“I’m hoping that ‘Glass Onion,’ even though it’s a very limited release, will deliver sufficient numbers that will certainly tweak some interest into doing something more in the future because they’ve got some amazing movies coming up,” Mr. Richards of Vue International said. “They’re moving slowly but I’m hopeful that there will be a change in thinking.”"

There’s only one thing you really need to know as Thanksgiving gets underway, and it applies whether you’re cooking or filling a seat, whether you’re a guest or a host, and whether you’re working a shift or stuck in an airport. It’s this: Everything is going to be all right.
Everything’s going to be all right because you’re going to repeat that phrase like a mantra until it becomes a fact, until it turns into gear to protect you from whatever foul weather comes your way. Kitchen disasters, rude relatives, guests who are late, failed pies, scorched mashed potatoes, not enough wine — it’s fine. These things happen.
Allow them to happen. Practice radical empathy, for others and for yourself today. And don’t worry ’bout a thing.
Fact, from those of us at New York Times Cooking: Your turkey is done when its internal temperature, measured at the deepest part of the thigh, is 165 degrees. I pull mine out of the oven at 160 or 162, knowing that the temperature will continue to rise as the bird rests on my counter beneath its jaunty foil cap. But I’ve also seen numbers closer to 180 over the years and (see the advice above) tamped down my stress about that. Carved and moistened with stock, and then served with a lot of gravy, an overcooked bird can still make for a marvelous meal.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
(Don’t panic if you don’t have a thermometer. Use a fork or a paring knife to pierce the skin of the thigh. If the juices run clear, you’re good. If the legs are loose in their sockets, you’re good.)
Advice: Rest your bird before carving, to allow it to settle. Plan for at least 20 minutes, though I’ve gone as long as an hour with no ill effect.
If you’re looking for help in your cooking today, avail yourself of the resources on New York Times Cooking, including our Thanksgiving FAQ, our best recipes for the feast and our best last-minute recipes. We also have guides to help you roast and carve the turkey, and for making gravy, cranberry sauce, brussels sprouts, pie crust, potatoes and stuffing.

A many-layered sequel
“Glass Onion,” a sequel to the twisty, funny whodunit “Knives Out,” is now in theaters. Daniel Craig plays Benoit Blanc, the master detective with the Foghorn Leghorn accent who is once again summoned by rich eccentrics to solve a mystery. This time, the host is a tech billionaire (Edward Norton) who has invited friends to play a murder-mystery game on his private island.
“The plot twists and loops, stretching logic to the breaking point while making a show of following the rules,” A.O. Scott writes in The Times. “I can’t say much about what happens in ‘Glass Onion’ without giving away some surprises, but I can say that some of the pleasure comes from being wrong about what will happen next.”

To the Editor:
“It Was a Bad Week for Billionaires With Delusions of Saving the World,” by Anand Giridharadas (Opinion guest essay, Nov. 21), was on the money.
Billionaires got to their lofty heights by anything but benevolence. The tax code provides incentives for philanthropy, which also acts as a public relations cover for the exploitation of the people who actually assist in the billionaires’ success.
I believe in capitalism and material success, but our current system is so top-heavy that it is counterproductive. Trickle-down was the rationale for tax advantages in order to spread the wealth. I think we saw through that fallacy. Warren Buffett observed that he pays a lower tax rate than his staff.
I always wonder how a person’s life changes when their net worth goes from one billion to two billion. Obviously art collections expand, mansions and townhouses multiply, and private jets become fleets. How does that help average Americans?

I believe in incentives and rewarding innovation, but the law of diminishing returns still applies. “Sprinkling some fairy dust,” in Mr. Giridharadas’s words, won’t solve our social problems. The capital must be more widespread; otherwise the system will collapse because the pyramid’s foundation will be too weak to support the pinnacle. These emperors are clothed but misguided.

To the Editor:
Anand Giridharadas’s guest essay is incredibly cynical.
He ignores the many good deeds by the very wealthy. How about the Gates Foundation’s work to eliminate malaria; or Paul Tudor Jones’s Robin Hood Foundation; or Ken Langone’s work with N.Y.U.’s medical school, including funding all tuitions; or Warren Buffett’s Giving Pledge, commitments by the extremely wealthy to give the majority of their money to philanthropy, etc.?

And to call Jeff Bezos’s contribution to charity as sprinkles of “fairy dust” is the height of cynical sarcasm. Mr. Giridharadas attacks Amazon for a small employee reduction, not mentioning that Amazon hired hundreds of thousands of displaced people during the pandemic at substantially higher wages than its competitors. And, unfortunately, stewards of entities must manage for the long term to avoid more layoffs.
His essay reflects a complete lack of balance.

To the Editor:
Thanks to Anand Giridharadas, whose cogent insights ably demystify the alluring but ultimately bankrupt pose of opulent plutocrats pretending to be magnanimous social crusaders. Indeed these hypocrites with bulging wallets need to be subject to laws, regulations and a just system of taxation that can properly and equitably use excess wealth in service of our skewed society’s desperate needs.
Given the encouraging trends indicated by the recent election, maybe a critical mass of the electorate is beginning to wake up to the scams of the ultra-rich as well as the ultra-right.

As billionaires, by their actions, make their own case against themselves, Anand Giridharadas corrects the genius myths that raise their standing and enhance their power. He insists that they “are not our saviors.”

Re “As Country Reopens, Americans Either Fear the Virus or Forget It” (front page, Nov. 15):
The pandemic is not over, despite proclamations to the contrary; acting as if it is over does not make it over. With more than 300 deaths per day and projections of more than 100,000 a year for years to come, it is long overdue that we use this time as a teachable moment, beyond adequate masking and up-to-date immunization.
In an event like a viral pandemic, public health authorities and health care providers need to address the underlying causes that lead to more severe outcomes. Serious Covid infections are largely preventable or mitigated by attending to largely controllable lifestyle factors including diet, exercise, timely management of pre-existing conditions and harm reduction (cessation or reduction of nicotine and alcohol use).

Of course, infants, the immunocompromised and the elderly must be protected, by a population willing to test, quarantine when ill, vaccinate and mask as dictated by local conditions. But it remains within the power of millions to adopt healthier habits as a means of improving the pre-existing conditions that are predictors of Covid hospitalizations, disability and death.
We must also address what may be the most significant factor when it comes to explaining the dramatic differences in national infection, hospitalization and death rates, according to an important study published by the British medical journal The Lancet: the inverse relationship of citizens’ trust in government health authorities and each other, and pandemic outcomes. Simply put: Less trust, more Covid.
In a world of multiplying variants, let us use this time to encourage healthier living and to rebuild our trust in public health.

To the Editor:
In the newly elected House Republican caucus, the MAGA members hold undue sway because of the small majority the Republicans hold. This will make approving any necessary bills or getting anything substantial accomplished difficult, if not impossible.
Are there not 10 or 15 middle-of-the-road Republican House members who have the courage to join the Democratic minority (à la the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus) to get something done for the good of their constituents and our country? If there are not, the next two years will be wasted in partisan wrangling and investigations that will splinter our country further.
These times call for courage, selflessness and love of country over ambition and party loyalty. Can it happen?

Democratic House leaders should make selected moderate House Republicans aware that they could count on Democratic votes for the speakership. Hopefully a moderate Republican would try to address issues in addition to being forced to pursue partisan objectives.

To the Editor:
If Vladimir Putin wanted the nation of Ukraine to join the Russian sphere of influence, he would be doing things that win over the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people. But what the free world sees from the shocking and tragic photographs and other remarkable journalism is that Mr. Putin cares only for Ukraine’s real estate.
He cares not a whit for the Ukrainian people. That is brought into focus with the documentation of war crimes that shows the thousands of murdered Ukrainian men, women and children, and the destruction of whole Ukrainian towns and cities.

2022-11-27,"Amazon held what amounted to an extra Prime Day in October, blanketing its site with deals. Best Buy rolled out Black Friday-level sales last month. And on Friday, Kohl’s entered the first 200 people to walk into each of its stores into a sweepstakes, with prizes including gift cards to Sephora and a family trip to a Legoland resort.
With the arrival of the all-important holiday shopping season, retailers are not just competing with one another to attract customers. They are also competing against the clock.
For now, Americans are spending, buoyed by pandemic-era savings and a red-hot labor market. But at the same time, prices are climbing at the fastest pace in decades and the Federal Reserve is attempting to rein them in by raising interest rates. That effort to curb demand by making borrowing more expensive is, in turn, making consumers pessimistic about the economy. And a recession is a distinct possibility.
Retailers, some of them sitting on a glut of inventory, want to sell as much as they can while consumers are still pulling out their wallets. So they are barraging customers with discounts, hoping to entice them to buy before an economic slowdown causes a change in behavior once more.

Whether retailers succeed will have profound implications. Billions of dollars are at stake, and companies will be watching the outcome closely as they make hiring and investment decisions for the new year.
“We’re going to spend a lot of time right now focused on executing our plan, getting through the holiday season and then assessing the consumer and the overall retail landscape as we look to 2023,” Brian Cornell, the chief executive of Target, said on a call with analysts this month.
More broadly, retail sales during the holiday shopping period could provide clues about the trajectory of the economy in the weeks and months to come.
“For the overall economy, I think that it’s going to be very important to look at what the consumer is doing because really that’s going to be your key indicator,” said Lydia Boussour, an economist at EY-Parthenon. “It’s the key engine of growth.”

Forecasters generally believe that consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of total economic growth, will remain strong in the fourth quarter, in large part because of household savings. Collectively, Americans by the middle of this year were still sitting on about $1.7 trillion in extra savings accumulated during the pandemic, based on Fed estimates, thanks in part to government aid.

But in September, the most recent month for which calculations were available, Americans saved only 3.1 percent of their after-tax income, less than half the share before the pandemic. And poorer Americans are seeing their savings dwindle even faster than wealthier ones.
Meanwhile, credit card balances in the third quarter swelled 15 percent compared with a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That was the largest increase in more than two decades, as consumers increasingly rely on credit even as borrowing costs are rising.
And a University of Michigan survey this month showed a sharp decline in “consumer sentiment” — a measurement of how people feel about the economy and their financial situation. Even as consumers continue to make purchases, Ms. Boussour said, “they’re feeling depressed about the overall economic situation, and they are going to grow increasingly reluctant to spend.”

Retail sales grew 1.3 percent in October, more than expected, as shoppers snapped up earlier-than-usual holiday deals. Some major retailers including Walmart and Home Depot reported strong third-quarter earnings, bolstered by sales for less discretionary goods like groceries or items related to home renovation and do-it-yourself projects. “Households are still spending money because they can,” said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at the investment bank Jefferies. “I still think there’s a lot of uncertainty about next year because the Fed obviously has raised rates very aggressively this year and we haven’t really felt the effects yet.”
But several retailers said they saw demand for their products slow during the month, and when shoppers did buy, they seemed motivated by sales. Some companies have lowered their financial outlook or declined outright to provide forecasts for next year to avoid being caught flat-footed.
This was not how the end of this year was supposed to be. For two holiday shopping seasons, retailers strained against pandemic disruptions. Now that the virus restrictions and supply chain snarls that defined those periods have largely abated, retailers had been expecting something of a return to normal.
Instead, retailers find themselves trying to outrun a likely economic slowdown.
To entice bargain-hungry shoppers and move unwanted inventory, many companies are promoting “value,” offering steep discounts and low prices more so than last year even as labor costs remain high. Many started their holiday blitzes early in the hopes of jump starting sales. Target held Deal Days in October and Old Navy rolled out a “Sorry, Not Sorry” holiday campaign. “Value clearly matters to everyone,” Corie Barry, the chief executive of Best Buy, said on an earnings call last week.

At J.C. Penney, stores returned to 5 a.m. doorbusters on Black Friday, promoting the “pre-inflation pricing” for items like Instant Pots, hair flat irons and coats.
Jeff Gennette, the chief executive of Macy’s, said that a feature on its website that allows users to peruse gifts priced from $15 to $100 seemed to be particularly tempting to shoppers.
“If you’ve got an item that’s competing with the competitor, and you’re a higher price, you’ve got to make those adjustments,” he said.
Retailers are trying to eliminate any obstacles between a shopper and a potential purchase. Jill Timm, the chief financial officer for Kohl’s, said the chain was providing more personalized offers to shoppers, as well as clearly laying out the discount amounts on certain items to prevent customers from being confused “because they had to do math.”
Kohl’s is “really making sure that the offers that we’re putting in are meaningful to the customer to drive their behavior,” Ms. Timm said.

Signaling value is part of the overall strategy for Primark, an international clothing retailer, as it looks to grow its presence in the United States.
In a recently opened store at a mall in Garden City, N.Y., Primark executives pointed out large signs that advertised $11 hoodies, $4 biker shorts and $20 for a baby-blue bag featuring Stitch from the Disney movie “Lilo and Stitch” — and noted that a candle, at 90 cents without any holiday discount, cost less than at Walmart.
“It needs to be a very clear moment when you walk in of that perception that there is amazing value throughout the whole store,” said Kevin Tulip, Primark’s U.S. president.
Shoppers seemed price conscious on Black Friday and throughout the weekend.
Retailers dropped online prices for merchandise like toys, electronics and computers, according to data released on Friday from Adobe Analytics. Discounts for sporting goods and TVs were far steeper this year than last year, according to Adobe data, and clothing prices were slightly lower this year. The average discount for Black Friday deals in the United States was 30 percent, according to Salesforce. In 2019, Salesforce said, the average discount rate for Black Friday was 33 percent.
In-store sales on Friday rose 12 percent from last year, and e-commerce sales increased 14 percent compared with 2021, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse data released on Saturday. Those sales included spending not just in retail stores but also at restaurants.

Still, not everyone was satisfied. On social media, people complained that Black Friday deals weren’t as sizable as they expected.
In San Francisco, Riz Gordon, 24, woke up at 6 a.m. on Friday to shop with her parents and younger sister. Going to the stores that day is “a long family tradition,” she said, and they had already picked out stocking stuffers and smaller presents. But inflation was on their minds.
“The prices are very much different than 10 years ago,” Ms. Gordon said.
On Sunday, at a Target in Springfield, Ill., D.J. Baggerly, 69, made a quick trip for one final Christmas gift: a white knitted throw blanket. She had spent the weekend mostly shopping online, working through her grandchildren’s wish list.
Ms. Baggerly lives on a fixed income, and the higher prices for gas and groceries, she said, have been “ridiculous.” Asked if she planned to cut back on spending in the coming weeks, she said, “Oh yeah. I’m done.”

2022-11-28,"LONDON — In the latest penalty against Meta for violating European privacy rules, the tech giant was fined roughly $275 million on Monday for a data leak, discovered last year, that led to the personal information of more than 500 million Facebook users being published online.
The penalty, imposed by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, brings the fines that the regulator has imposed on Meta since last year to more than $900 million. In September, the same regulator fined the company roughly $400 million for its mistreatment of children’s data. In October last year, Irish authorities fined Meta, which was previously called Facebook, 225 million euros, or about $235 million, for violations related to its messaging service WhatsApp.
The accumulating penalties will be a welcome sign to privacy groups that want to see European Union regulators more aggressively enforce the General Data Protection Regulation. The law was hailed as a landmark moment in the regulation of technology companies when it took effect in 2018, but regulators have since faced criticism for not applying the rules strongly enough.
Ireland has been under pressure because of the key role it plays in enforcing E.U. data protection rules. The country polices tech companies’ compliance with the 2018 law because companies such as Meta, Google and Twitter put their E.U. headquarters in Ireland. TikTok, which also set up a E.U. hub in Ireland, is the subject of another investigation there.
The fine issued on Monday stems from an investigation started last year by Irish regulators into reports that Facebook had not safeguarded its platform against being “scraped” for information, leading to the publication on an online hacker forum of data that included users’ names, locations and birth dates, in violation of rules that require companies to safeguard personal information.
Meta said in a statement that “unauthorized data scraping is unacceptable and against our rules.” The company said it had changed its policies to prevent such practices. Meta did not say whether it would appeal the decision, as it has for the Instagram and WhatsApp penalties.
Meta is not the only tech giant facing scrutiny. Last year, Amazon was fined nearly €750 million over its online advertising practices by regulators in Luxembourg, where it has its European headquarters. In January, Google was fined €150 million by French regulators because users were not given an adequate way to decline so-called cookie trackers used by online advertisers to trace a person’s internet browsing history."
2022-11-29,"While “Ainbo” follows the royal family of Candamo, who lives in an Amazon rainforest village threatened by mining encroachment, it is the eponymous best friend of the princess who forges a plan to save them.
Ainbo (Lola Raie), a young huntress with her head in the clouds, nearly misses the coronation ceremony of her best friend, Zumi (Naomi Serrano), as princess of Candamo. Ainbo is busy hiking deep into the forest and on her way back to the ceremony meets a playful pair of unlikely “spirit guides,” Dillo (Dino Andrade), a comical armadillo and Vaca (Joe Hernandez), a sheepish tapir. Her late mother’s spirit has sent them to aid Ainbo in becoming the seasoned hunter she needs to be in order to save her people from the greed of DeWitt, a gold mining speculator masquerading as a botanist.
Directed by Jose Zelada and Richard Claus, this animated feature is at its best when it fills out the world of Candamo and its people with meticulous detail and lush color. The visual rendering of spiritual myths and gods give the film its primary bursts of energy. The main villain of “Ainbo,” for instance, takes inspiration from the Yacuruna archetype, the shape-shifting water-dwelling god (similar to Amphibian Man in Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water”).

But the vivid patterns of body paint and intricate costumes of Candamo’s royals, warriors and hunters have to contend with a generic plot that turns its complex subject matter and distinct characters into a predictable naptime preamble. The story dawdles through its first and second acts, but in its final third does find a more deliberate pace. One wishes it had been there from the start.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Democrats and Republicans agree to prevent a rail strike. After a meeting with President Biden at the White House on Tuesday, congressional leaders said they would quickly draft the legislation needed to prevent a work stoppage. The stakes are huge: A stoppage could snarl supply chains during the holiday season, causing vast economic harm. And there are still potential holdouts on both sides of the aisle.
NATO doubles down on support for Ukraine. As top diplomats met in Bucharest to discuss bolstering Ukraine’s defenses, officials stressed their commitment to one day allowing Kyiv membership in the military alliance. More immediately, the U.S. said it will give the country $53 million for equipment to repair its battered electricity grid after weeks of Russian airstrikes.

The Senate passes landmark legislation protecting same-sex marriage. The bill, which passed 61-36, will now go to the House, where it is expected to pass as soon as next week. President Biden said in a statement that the Senate vote reaffirmed “a fundamental truth: Love is love.”

2022-12-01,"“Hunt,” the feature directorial debut of the South Korean actor Lee Jung-jae (a star of “Squid Game”), is a tangled espionage thriller that recalls the suspenseful works of the British novelist John le Carré.
Set during the early 1980s, the film, dominated by flashbacks, features double crosses, subterfuge, geopolitical angst and professional regret as the backdrop to an intense pursuit by two competing intelligence agents — Park Pyong-ho (Lee) and Kim Jung-do (Jung Woo-sung) — to uncover a North Korean mole embedded in their agency who intends to assassinate South Korea’s president.
A dense narrative bursting with elaborate red herrings proves an unmanageable mess as the film wears on. Kim and Park accuse each other of being the spy; student protests explode; missions misfire; anonymous soldiers eliminate key witnesses; and Kim uses an allegation of treason against Park’s adoptive daughter (Go Yoon-jung) as blackmail. All of this is barely held together by vigorous shootouts littered throughout. Lee’s overt visual homages to Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma” and Ben Affleck’s “Argo,” his keen eye for period detail, the rising body count and the moral quandary that arises when Park and Kim question their loyalty to their country do little to reclaim one’s interest.

A convoluted conclusion, begot by an unconvincing change of heart, obliterates any chance of “Hunt” offering the clarity it needs to be entertaining. Instead, Lee’s directorial effort wanders toward something unmemorable.

2022-12-02,"Christine Cruzvergara used to sit in her office — decorated with a plaque that read, “Allergic to mediocrity” — and dole out advice about ambition.
Ms. Cruzvergara ran the campus career service centers at George Mason University and later at Wellesley College, a campus whose competitive culture was reflected in the way students approached their job searches. When they talked about openings that seemed to check various boxes — purpose, prestige, paycheck — she heard a common refrain: “This is my dream job.”
Now, as the head of education strategy for Handshake, a networking platform serving more than 10 million college students, Ms. Cruzvergara is watching that sentiment shift. Handshake surveyed about 1,400 recent college graduates and current seniors to ask about their top job search priority: 73 percent said stability. Fewer than half, by comparison, said a priority was to work for a known brand.
“In the past, students were often looking for location, they were looking for brand name,” Ms. Cruzvergara said. Today, “there’s a practicality to how people are looking at their job search.”

If stability is what young workers are after, the unquestionably strong job market is in a prime position to comply. The unemployment rate is at nearly a five-decade low. There are more openings across industries than there were before the pandemic, and layoffs across the economy are low by historical standards. Employers added 263,000 jobs last month, the government said on Friday, in the latest show of economic strength.
But some young people are anxious nonetheless. For the nearly two-thirds of young American adults who didn’t graduate from college, job insecurities are sharpened by inflation, at a 40-year high. Others, who did go to college, are entering their careers after years of school disruptions and rising levels of mental distress. And for the very small subset who graduated from college and planned to seek out especially high-paying, perk-filled jobs, like those in technology, there’s the angst of witnessing layoffs across the companies associated with the most alluring roles.
All that has sapped at the optimism of some young job seekers. Job-seeker confidence declined in October, according to ZipRecruiter. Nearly half of current college seniors reported expanding their job searches because of economic anxiety.
“Lately, with a lot of people being let go from their jobs, it’s opened my eyes to look for a job where I can feel more stable,” said Giana Gaitan-Naranjo, 21, a senior at San Francisco State University. “If a company has some boxes ticked, I’d feel happy working for them for a bit.”
Ms. Gaitan-Naranjo is applying to most design jobs she can find that pay more than $19 an hour. There’s relief just in visualizing herself done with school, all those jammed weeks of classes and 20 hours of restaurant shifts. She wants to know that she won’t be reliant on financial support from her parents, a housekeeper and a landscaper.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In conversations with more than a dozen young job seekers, many said years of uncertainty and upheaval had left them feeling that they should freeze or delay the search for a dream job and focus on finding a secure one.
The share of job seekers of all ages who said security was one of their top priorities rose to 37 percent in October, from 31 percent in January, according to ZipRecruiter. One young woman said she was applying only to jobs with salary ranges listed so she could feel confident about making ends meet as prices climbed. Another switched to marketing from sports entertainment, worried about future opportunities in her field given the pandemic’s effects.
When Tiffany Dyba, a recruiter in New York City, reached out to young people about job openings, she said, they used to respond with a list of questions: Were there free lunches? What about happy hours on Fridays with kegs in the office? Gallup polling tended to find that older workers valued an employer’s financial stability more than younger ones, who value diversity and transparency.
“Now people are like, ‘Is this job remote?’ And ‘I need to know the compensation right now,’” Ms. Dyba said. “It’s not about the dream job anymore.”
It’s unsettling for some young people to see employers long associated with free-flowing perks and eye-popping salaries make their largest-ever job cuts. Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees last month. Amazon laid off roughly 10,000 people in corporate and technology roles. Twitter laid off over 3,000 people. Meta once offered laundry services to its employees. Twitter, until recently, had free lunch.

“It’s a reality check for most people,” said Rachael Noble, 27, who was laid off from her position at a tech start-up in August and is now looking for a new role from her home in San Diego. “It’s recalibrating your mental model on how to approach job hunting. There can be growing pains.”
The first job market that someone enters is significant. Those first 10 years of work typically shape a person’s lifetime earning potential, with the bulk of earning growth happening early on, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
In a survey this year of some 20,000 workers, from Bain & Company, 61 percent of those under 35 said they were concerned about finances, job security and their ability to meet career goals, compared with 40 percent of those 35 and older. And some of those young people are struggling to balance a hunger for certainty, and solid ground, with the feeling that they don’t want to settle.
“There have been a lot of painful disruptions,” said Jeffrey Arnett, a developmental psychologist who coined the term “emerging adulthood,” noting that the 20s are a sensitive age. “It’s already difficult to make your way into the job market at any time.”

Alexis Carr, 23, was the first person in her family to graduate from college, and when she got in she couldn’t wait to set up a life far from her childhood bedroom in Austin, Texas, with the yellow walls. But when Covid swept through campus, she ended up cut off from friends, studying for exams in random corners of the house where her brother hadn’t set up his own books. She started getting chest tightness, which turned out to be panic attacks.

Now Ms. Carr is looking for her first full-time job, focusing on mental health nonprofits, and saving up by working as a server at an Italian restaurant, where her customers sometimes leave notes commenting on her sweetness. She keeps trying to remind herself that the bitterness and angst of the last few years aren’t going to define the rest of her career.
“I’m just getting started,” she said. “I’ve never lived outside of home. I’ve never lived alone. I’m just now breaking the seal.”
Career coaches are doing their best to guide the young adults who feel unmoored. Some are advising a shift from five-year professional plans to two- or three-year plans, recognizing the tumultuous effects of the pandemic on nearly every industry. Others are focusing their conversations with job candidates on critical benefits, like health care plans and 401(k) plans, instead of the luxe perks once discussed, such as foosball and kombucha.
And pandemic-induced stress is prompting some young people to expand their job searches beyond the handful of openings that seem exactly matched to their career aspirations.

Laura Yin, who graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 2020 as a mechanical engineer, was less picky during her search than she had anticipated, given all the uncertainty surrounding her pandemic life. Even her salary standard dropped.
“It was like, ‘I don’t know if I really want to work for a wastewater plant, but they have a job opening,’” she said.
Resetting expectations was painful. Ms. Yin, who worked as an industrial maintenance mechanic before college, had already lost out on the graduation festivities that she had planned with her parents and partner.
“I’m not a big fan of large crowds,” she said. “But once the pandemic hit and everything started shutting down, and they were like, ‘We’re not going to have a ceremony — you can watch it on your computer at home,’ I was like, ‘Oh, I didn’t even realize I did want that.’”
Handshake reported that over one-third of students graduating in 2023 were open to industries they hadn’t previously considered, because of anxiety about the economy, and that one-fifth were starting their searches earlier.

Caught between hope and unsteadiness, many are wrestling with what they want from the years to come.
Shasparay Irvin, 25, saw the pandemic derail her final semester at the University of Wisconsin. She “graduated into a void,” accepting her diploma in the mail. She knew she wanted to work in the performing arts, so she took a job teaching theater to elementary school students on video, calling out “Stage right!” and “Stage left!” to rows of heads floating on Zoom.
Then she quit, feeling frustrated by the work. Ms. Irvin is now in a one-year master’s program, performing in slam poetry shows and researching jobs in arts administration.
“I graduated at the worst time to graduate,” she said. “Now I’m reframing to say, ‘What do I want to spend the time I have doing?’”"

2022-12-06,"Ever since she was a 10th grader in Seattle, Annalice Ni wanted to develop software for a prominent tech company like Google. So she went to great lengths to meet the internship and other résumé criteria that make students attractive hires to the biggest tech firms.
In high school, Ms. Ni took computer science courses, interned at Microsoft and volunteered as a coding teacher for younger students. She majored in computer science at the University of Washington, earning coveted software engineering internships at Facebook. After graduating from college this year, she moved to Silicon Valley to start her dream job as a software engineer at Meta, Facebook’s parent company.
Then last month, Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees — including Ms. Ni.
“I did feel very frustrated and disappointed and maybe a bit scared because all of a sudden, I didn’t know what to do,” Ms. Ni, 22, said of her unexpected career setback. “There’s not much I could have done, especially in college, more than I already did, better than I already did.”

Over the last decade, the prospect of six-figure starting salaries, perks like free food and the chance to work on apps used by billions led young people to stampede toward computer science — the study of computer programming and processes like algorithms — on college campuses across the United States. The number of undergraduates majoring in the subject more than tripled from 2011 to 2021, to nearly 136,000 students, according to the Computing Research Association, which tracks computing degrees at about 200 universities.

2022-12-07,"Nothing has been easy for the Sundance Film Festival. It’s been thwarted by pandemic complications, management upheaval and a business that is undergoing an identity crisis. But the confab will finally return to the snowy mining town of Park City, Utah, in January for the first time in three years with a slate of films it hopes will announce to both Hollywood and the rest of the world that independent filmmaking is back.
Culled from a record 4,061 feature submissions, Sundance 2023, set to begin Jan. 19, will be filled with veteran filmmakers and those just starting out, subjects big and small, and a host of urgent topics. Stalwarts like Nicole Holofcener and Ira Sachs are returning to their roots with new films, while studios will unveil their fare.
A24 is premiering “All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt,” from the director Raven Jackson and producers Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski, among others. Searchlight is screening “Rye Lane” from Raine Allen-Miller. Amazon has “Cassandro,” the documentarian Roger Ross Williams’s first foray into fiction filmmaking, and Focus Features is showing A.V. Rockwell’s “A Thousand and One” in the U.S. dramatic competition.
Brooke Shields (Disney), Judy Blume (Amazon), Michael J. Fox (Apple) Willie Nelson and Little Richard are all getting the documentary treatment, while subjects like the Ukrainian war and films both by and about Iranian women are being explored via multiple entries in multiple genres.
“A lot of the filmmakers are looking at relationships: family, work, institutions — things we often look to for stability in unstable times,” said John Nein, Sundance’s senior programmer and director of strategic initiatives. “In the program, there is a reflection of an age of anxiety in terms of the relationships we have with traditional institutions. There are all these ways of exploring just how tenuous those relationships can be.”
Indeed, Daisy Ridley plays a woman obsessed with her mortality in one of several films opening the festival, “Sometimes I Think About Dying”; Jonathan Majors stars as an amateur bodybuilder struggling to find human connection in “Magazine Dreams”; and Susanna Fogel directs Emilia Jones and Nicholas Braun in “Cat Person,” based on the popular New Yorker short story by Kristen Roupenian.

2022-12-08,"Move over blow-up snowmen. This year, hollow plastic light-up figures are making a comeback and giving those inflatable fabric ornaments — the type with the fan inside — a run for their money.
The vintage-looking plastic lawn ornaments called blow molds are made by inflating melted plastic inside a die, in much the same way water bottles are created, then trimmed and painted. Shaped like reindeer, toy soldiers, Santa Claus, gingerbread men and even Arctic locomotives, the decorations have been around since at least the 1950s, having arrived around the same time as the plastic pink flamingo.
Although two of the leading manufacturers of classic blow molds, General Foam Plastics and Union Products, went out of business in 2018 and 2006, respectively, other companies such as Cado, which acquired Union’s molds, the Twillery Co. and Mr. Christmas are turning out new models and reproductions of old ones. Shoppers now can find blow-mold Nativity sets and giant holiday candles at Wayfair, Rudolphs and Grinches on Amazon, sincere snowmen at Home Depot, ornamental Olafs of “Frozen” fame at Walmart and saddle-wearing reindeer at Target.
“Guests are responding even more to blow mold decorations than in past years,” said Sarah A. White, a spokesperson for Target.

For collectors, though, original vintage models are still the most exciting to find. Those in good condition can sell for top dollar.
“Vintage holiday blow molds have skyrocketed in demand and price over the last four years,” said Megan Morrison, a Homer Glen, Ill.-based antique dealer specializing in holiday décor. A 36-inch light-up “Giant Santa Face,” manufactured by Empire in the early ’70s, which she recently featured on her Moxie Vintage Instagram account, for instance, would have cost $65 in 2018. “The asking price this year is more in the $300 to $400 range,” she said.
Such inflation has led some collectors to mix both old and new.
Vintage looking blow molds currently on sale at Michaels, Wayfair and Target.
“It was getting hard to find decently priced vintage stuff,” said Karen Ellis, a San Diego collector of Christmas kitsch. “But Target, Big Lots, Michaels and a bunch of other places are all selling really good reproductions.” Nostalgic Christmas decorations are always collectible, she said, “but blow molds are especially having a moment.” Ms. Ellis added three new ones and a vintage model to her collection of light-up plastic this year.
Social media, Ms. Morrison explained, has fueled this retro trend, the same way it did a revival of light-up ceramic Christmas trees a few years back. “There is a large and very active group of people on Instagram who share photos of their vintage Christmas collections, which often include blow molds. This inspires others to look for similar items to add to their own décor.”

If blow mold collectors have a king — at least in Los Angeles — it is the producer Glenn Geller.
The former president of CBS Entertainment, Mr. Geller has amassed an overabundance of these decorations, including 120 light-up toy soldiers, each almost three feet tall. In all, he has collected more than 500 blow mold figures for both Halloween and Christmas.
For each of those holidays, Mr. Geller decorates his residence — a Tudor Revival home in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles that was built in 1927 — with his collection of plastic figures. There are so many on his lawn that neighbors refer to the place as “the blow mold house.” It’s known as Lilley Hall, after the composer Joseph J. Lilley, who did the vocal arrangements for the 1942 Christmas movie “Holiday Inn,” and lived there from 1954 to 1971.

Mr. Geller began collecting blow molds, often via eBay, in earnest about seven years ago, a span in which he described as “not nearly as long as it should take for someone to own 500 blow molds.” He began by buying light-up plastic pumpkins to bewitch trick-or-treaters on his block, which can number in the thousands every Halloween. Christmas, though, has always been his true holiday love. He started that collection with light-up choir members, each 40 inches tall. “I bought 10 and then it became 20 and then it became a lot,” Mr. Geller said. “I ended up with 52 of them.”
His passion for this type of decoration began in the ’70s when blow molds were at the height of their popularity. “When I was a kid growing up in northwest Indiana, my dad and mom would take my sisters and me and drive around on New Year’s Eve and look at Christmas lights. On one lawn, there was a Santa Claus with nine reindeer, and it looked like they were flying. It was the most magical thing. I remember thinking, When I’m old enough to have a house, I want a Santa and nine flying reindeer.”
He has far surpassed that goal. Each year, Mr. Geller’s home is adorned with his extensive blow mold collection and more than 100,000 lights. They’re mostly LED bulbs, he noted, so the whole season bumps his electric bill by only $600. The display has made his home, if not a tourist attraction, a seasonal draw for locals who marvel at the multitude of figures. “The more you have of them, the more magic,” Mr. Geller said.

Although such blow mold figures were intended for outdoor display, some collectors have welcomed at least the smaller ones inside their holiday homes in recent years. “For lack of a fireplace in my New York City apartment, I place as many as will fit in my window wells,” said Chuck Hettinger, an East Village-based artist and decorative painter who has dozens of blow mold Santas. “They come in all shapes and sizes and any color, as long as it’s red. The glow is beautiful and, as a midcentury child, they can bring a tear to my eye.”
And as for those inflatable fabric decorations that have become so popular in the last decade or so? Those who prefer blow molds aren’t fans. “I just don’t like them,” Ms. Morrison said.
“Everyone should just take them out of their yards,” Mr. Geller said. “I hate them.”
Mr. Hettinger agreed. He remembered spending a recent Christmas in Ocean County, N.J., with friends whose neighbor’s home happened to be decorated with a lawn full of inflatables. No matter how expansive the collection or well-intentioned, the display didn’t hold the same allure that a blow-mold front-lawn extravaganza like Mr. Geller’s would.
“Honestly,” Mr. Hettinger said, “it was a like a bad drug trip.”"
2022-12-09,"Since Microsoft brought him to the United States 14 years ago, Abhishikt Jain has excelled professionally, raised a family and settled into a four-bedroom house with a garage “full of unnecessary stuff,” he said.
“You could say I achieved the American dream,” said the software engineer, now 43, who is from India and lives in Bellevue, Wash.
But in October, Mr. Jain fell victim to layoffs battering the tech industry, and suddenly his family’s future was thrust into uncertainty. On the cusp of securing permanent U.S. residency after a 12-year wait, Mr. Jain instead faced the prospect of packing up and leaving the United States unless he quickly found another job or finally received his green card.
After years of galloping growth, the U.S. tech sector has slammed on the brakes amid rising inflation and worries about a recession. A hiring bonanza has given way to drastic head count reductions to slash costs.

Getting sacked during the holiday season is a blow to any worker. But for foreigners on temporary work visas, the challenges go far beyond managing without paychecks. They must find jobs within 60 days at another company willing to sponsor them for a visa, or they must leave the country. And many stand to lose their shot at U.S. permanent residency after spending years in a green-card backlog.
So far this year, more than 146,000 tech workers have been laid off, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks them, including 51,000 in November alone. A substantial share of those terminated were foreigners, even though employers have not disclosed how many workers on temporary visas have been let go.
The cutbacks have sent anxious foreign workers scrambling to find new jobs, and as the clock ticks, looking for possible workarounds, such as transferring to temporary visitor status to buy a little more time to job hunt.

“The magnitude of the layoffs is of the likes I have never seen before. There is chaos and confusion,” said Tahmina Watson, an immigration lawyer in Seattle who has been barraged with queries from laid-off foreign workers.

“Not only are tech companies laying people off in unprecedented numbers, but they are also implementing hiring freezes,” she said, “and thus, there are likely few alternative jobs for immigrant workers.”
Mr. Jain, who lost his job at Microsoft in October, is among tens of thousands of Indian engineers who for years have been creating software at information technology companies like Cisco, social-media platforms like Meta and online retailers like Amazon. Because of their crucial role, and a dearth of American STEM graduates, many foreign workers are being sponsored by their employers for U.S. permanent residency.
While parked in the backlog waiting for approval, the immigrants have built lives in the United States: They have had American children, taken out mortgages and become rooted in their communities.
Most are on high-skilled worker visas known as H-1Bs. More than 500,000 people are in the United States under the visas, the largest number hailing from India, followed by China, with the majority in science and technology fields.
Demand for such talent has soared as the U.S. economy has become increasingly reliant on technology. Between 2000 and 2019, the number of tech workers in the United States jumped by 44 percent, to 10.8 million from 7.5 million. For their programming, coding and other skills, many receive six-figure salaries.

As of 2019, foreign-born workers made up almost a quarter of all STEM workers in the country, up from about 16 percent in the year 2000, according to an analysis of census data by the American Immigration Council.
The visa holders are concentrated in California, home to Twitter, Meta and Apple, and in Washington State, home to Amazon, Microsoft, Zillow and Expedia. But they are also in states like Arkansas, toiling at the headquarters of Tyson, the poultry processor, to improve production efficiencies, and at Walmart, to design systems for self-checkouts.
This year, U.S. employers filed more than 480,000 petitions for the 85,000 H-1B visas available, and as in previous years, the government turned to a lottery to allocate them because of the large volume of applications.

But recent layoffs in the tech industry have abruptly upended the lives of workers already here.
After completing his acquisition of Twitter, Elon Musk slashed half the staff, or 3,700 employees, leaving many foreign workers on visas in urgent need of new employment.

“I am on an H-1B visa and have only 60 days to start a new job,” Yiwei Zhuang, a Chinese software engineer, wrote on LinkedIn.
After losing her job at Twitter, Sujatha Krishnaswamy, an Indian national, took to the platform to voice her angst at her precarious situation.
This year, while pregnant, “I worked day and night to successfully deliver a critical user-facing privacy feature to meet Twitter’s regulatory obligations,” she wrote. “I gave my heart and soul every day to meet Twitter’s Security and Privacy promises to users and regulators.”
Her H-1B status, she noted, was “exacerbating my situation.”
(Reached by phone recently, Ms. Krishnaswamy declined to answer any questions, saying she was focused on her job search.)
If H-1B workers and their families return to their country of origin after being laid off, their employer is obligated to pay for their airfare home.

To stay in the United States, they must find a company willing to shoulder the costs of renewing their H-1B visa, and to pay fees associated with their green-card applications, if they are in process, which are employment-based.
“A new employer has to agree to spend up to $20,000 extra for an H-1B worker,” said Jonathan Grode, a lawyer in Philadelphia who specializes in employment-based immigration.
“It makes you less attractive for an employer” than workers who are U.S. citizens or green-card holders, who also may have been laid off and are looking for work, he said. “That’s the conundrum.”
An informal database set up by two Indian tech workers on LinkedIn to help fellow H-1B visa holders find jobs has attracted more than 500 people, who have shared their information with hopes of being connected to prospective employers.
“We expected 40 to 50 people. But as soon as we created the database, it exploded,” said Shruti Anand, who launched the effort last month with a friend, Vidhi Agrawal.

The women quickly realized that the reach of the layoffs extended beyond the software industry. “It’s all over, anywhere that tech touches,” said Ms. Anand, “people in health care, food industry are losing their jobs.”
After introducing hiring freezes, many companies have moved to shrink their staffs as they brace for the impact of supply-chain issues, as well as rising interest rates and costs on their bottom lines.
Layoffs have occurred steadily at tech titans and midsize firms but also at smaller companies and start-ups.

Many companies that boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, such as Amazon, DoorDash and Netflix, have seen lower demand as consumer behavior returns to pre-pandemic patterns.
ADVERTISEMENT

After The Times reported that Amazon planned to lay off 10,000 workers, its chief executive, Andy Jassy, confirmed in a message to employees last month that the job cuts were happening, but he did not specify how many. Computerworld reported last week that 20,000 workers could get pink slips in coming months.
Last month, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, was laying off more than 11,000 employees to reduce its work force by 13 percent, and the company extended a hiring freeze through the first quarter of next year.
Some employers have offered generous severance packages. DoorDash, for example, which announced on Nov. 30 that it was laying off about 1,250 workers, has set the termination date of workers for March 1, to give people on visas more time to find a new job if they choose to remain in the United States.
Back in Washington State, Microsoft gave Mr. Jain severance that provides him a cushion, and he took pains to emphasize that the company had been a good employer for 17 years, three of them while he worked in India.
Yet even with his deep experience, finding a new job has been challenging, he said, because the wave of layoffs coupled with hiring freezes has created stiff competition.

This week he won a major reprieve: After more than a decade of waiting, his green card suddenly arrived in the mail. His ability to live in the United States no longer depended on his employment.
“Now the stress is much less,” said Mr. Jain, who is married and has two sons. “I just have to find a job.”"
2022-12-10,"Q: We moved to New York City this summer so we are not familiar with holiday tipping protocol. Can you make suggestions for tipping ranges for a midsize co-op with a building staff of 13? I know tips are also based on personal experiences with the staff, so we want to get a general idea of what is expected.
A: New Yorkers take holiday tipping very seriously. Some buildings give residents lists of employees, and even include suggestions for how much to give. Others offer a pool where residents can give a lump sum that is divvied up among the staff. But many buildings leave the decision to the tenants. So, as a newcomer to this tradition, how do you decide how much to give?
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The answer varies based on factors unique to you and your building. Staff in co-ops and condos tend to expect more generous tips than those in rentals. Expect to give more at a full-service building than one without a doorman. Ask neighbors on your floor for advice. “You could say, ‘I know, this is kind of a personal topic because it deals with money, but do you have recommendations?’” said Lizzie Post, the great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post and co-author of “Emily Post’s Etiquette, The Centennial Edition.” “You’re not asking them what they paid or what they gave as tips, you’re saying: ‘Do you have recommendations for a tipping range for this building and for the staff in it?’”
A tipping calculator could help. The Agency’s Tip-o-Meter calculates a tipping range based on factors including the size of your apartment, how long you’ve lived in it and how generous of a tipper you are.
But tweak the guidelines for your own situation. If you order DoorDash and Amazon four days a week and need help unloading luggage after every holiday weekend, your doorman will expect a thicker envelope. However, if you’re never home and are not even sure the staff knows you live there, you do not need to tip as lavishly.
Consider the big picture, too. We are living in a time of inflation, so whatever tip you give this year won’t go as far as it would have last year. If you are in a position to give a larger sum than you might otherwise, this is a year to do so.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But if you are facing financial hardship, as many households are, it is OK to scale back. Make a budget and divide the total among the staff. Include a holiday card with a note to express your appreciation.
Whatever you do, give something. And that includes building staff you do not like. You may have your favorite doorman or a special rapport with the super, but do not neglect the overnight doorman you’ve never seen, or a staff member who has frustrated you over the year. They are all expecting a tip.
“It is a big insult to tip nothing,” said Jennifer White Karp, the managing editor of Brick Underground, which has a holiday tipping guide. “You do not want to alienate the people who work in your building.”

2022-12-11,"The uncrewed Artemis I test flight is over, but Artemis II — what will be the first with astronauts aboard — will not be until at least 2024.
In an interview this summer, Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, vented about the gap between Artemis I and Artemis II. “I have been raising Cain,” he said. “If this first mission is successful and meets the goals and is safe for the astronauts, why can’t we get it quicker than two years?”
Mr. Nelson said that years ago, to save money, NASA decided to reuse some of the electronics equipment, known as avionics, from the Artemis I Orion capsule in the new Orion capsule for Artemis II. “It takes them two years to take the avionics out and redo them,” Mr. Nelson said, “which is very frustrating to me, but it is what it is.”
There will be four astronauts aboard Artemis II. Three will be from NASA, and one will be Canadian, part of the agreement spelling out the Canadian Space Agency’s participation in the Artemis program. NASA has not yet announced who will fly on the mission.
The trajectory of Artemis II will be fairly simple. After launch, the second stage of the Space Launch System will push Orion into an elliptical orbit that loops as far out as 1,800 miles above Earth, giving the astronauts time to see how Orion’s systems work.
Then, when Orion speeds around again, its engine will fire to send it toward the moon. For Artemis II, the Orion spacecraft will not enter orbit around the moon; it will instead use the moon’s gravity to sling back to Earth for a Pacific Ocean splashdown. The entire trip should take around 10 days.

2022-12-12,"NASHVILLE — As the documentary “Free Puppies” opens, a fluffy dog named Albert is galloping down a beach boardwalk. His companion, a much bigger dog, is leaping with excitement, but Albert is harnessed into a dog wheelchair. He was found on the side of a road in Arkansas, “either thrown out of a car or hit by a car,” a voice-over tells us. “We brought him up on one of those pet carriers that come up with tons of animals from the South.” Albert’s wheelchair bears a miniature Connecticut license plate.
This little dog is one of millions of pets transported from the American South to places in the Northeast and Midwest with fewer adoptable animals — communities where there are well funded animal-welfare agencies, stricter leash laws, a shorter breeding season and weather harsh enough that fewer strays survive.
Widespread animal relocation began in 2005 in response to Hurricane Katrina, according to Karen Walsh, the senior director of animal relocation at the A.S.P.C.A. “When we saw how many people were willing to step up and help an animal that had lost their home in Katrina, that idea grew,” she says in the film. “Animals started to flow across the country.”
Only a fraction of the needy pets here are cute enough or young enough to be easily placed this way — often based solely on a rescue organization’s website or social media feeds. So “Adopt, don’t shop” has become a national mantra among pet rescue advocates working desperately to reduce the number of animals euthanized in overcrowded shelters or left to starve on their own. Most of those doomed pets live in the South.
“Free Puppies” will be released on DVD — and as video-on-demand on Apple and Amazon — on Dec. 13. The heroes of the film are Monda Wooten, Ruth Smith and Ann Brown, three pet rescuers who live in the area where Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia meet. Their work to remedy local animal suffering is the narrative lens through which the film considers this regionwide problem.

“Free Puppies” follows the women as they collect unwanted litters; take in strays; persuade people to surrender neglected pets; bathe infested puppies with flea shampoo; even pick up animals from their homes, take them to a veterinary hospital or mobile clinic to be spayed or neutered, and return them to their owners at no charge.

2022-12-13,"LIMA, Peru — A relatively peaceful, if abrupt, transfer of presidential power in Peru last week has shifted into violence and unrest as supporters of the former president intensified claims that his ouster was illegitimate and have staged attacks against police stations, courthouses, factories, airports and a military base.
The protesters, backed by organizations that represent unions, Indigenous groups and poor farmers, are demanding new elections as quickly as possible.
At the same time, the leftist leaders of several Latin American countries have thrown their support behind Peru’s former leader, Pedro Castillo, who was removed from office last Wednesday and arrested after he tried to dissolve Congress.
The resulting unrest this week has grown and spread to different parts of the country as the government, while denouncing the violence, has struggled to stabilize the situation and respond to protesters’ demands.

On Tuesday night the defense minister, Alberto Otárola, announced that the armed forces would take responsibility for protecting strategic infrastructure such as airports and hydroelectric plants, and that the government would soon declare a state of emergency for the nation’s highway system. “We are not going to deny that the situation in this country is currently serious and worrying,” he said.
At least six people have died in the clashes, according to Peru’s ombudsman’s office, with all of the dead appearing to be protesters, among them five teenagers. Amnesty International and local human rights groups have accused the police of responding, in some cases, with excessive force.
Earlier Tuesday, the ombudsman’s office had said that seven protesters died, but corrected itself after it said that a man identified to the office as dead could not be found in the country’s civil registry.
On Tuesday, the country’s new president, Dina Boluarte, called for “calm.’’
“This situation that has cast a shadow over the country is causing anguish to the entire Peruvian family,” she said, speaking outside a hospital in Lima, the capital, having declared parts of the country under a state of emergency.
“I am a mother of two children, and I do not want to be going through this situation where our loved ones are dying,” she said.

Ms. Boluarte once campaigned alongside Mr. Castillo, but later called his actions a coup attempt. She is also a leftist, and comes from the largely poor Andean department of Apurímac, where the protests first erupted.
The new president said that she would meet with leaders of Peru’s armed forces and had the option of declaring a national state of emergency, a move that would suspend some civil liberties, but that she believed “would not be necessary.”

Peruvian authorities closed at least two airports amid the protests, including the airport in Cusco, which is used by tourists visiting Machu Picchu and the surrounding region known as the Sacred Valley, an important source of income for the country.
The police and army also said that a joint base was destroyed in the department of Cusco, while about 1,000 protesters had occupied a gas plant in the same area.

Train service to and from Cusco and Machu Picchu has also been suspended, according to a travel alert from the U.S. Embassy in Lima.
The country’s new finance minister, Alex Contreras, told a local news channel, RPP, that the protests could cost various sectors in Peru between $15 million and $26 million a day.
A police general, Óscar Arriola, said that 119 police officers were wounded in recent clashes, while Amnesty International said it had verified images of police officers firing tear gas canisters from close range directly at protesters in Lima’s main plaza.
In her speech on Tuesday, Ms. Boluarte said that she “had given instructions to the police not to use any lethal weapon, not even rubber bullets,” adding that she had asked the minister of interior “to identify the people who have used these weapons that are harming our sisters and brothers.”
Mr. Castillo, a leftist former schoolteacher and union activist who won the presidential election by a narrow margin last year, had struggled to govern, facing allegations of corruption, incompetence and mismanagement, while legislators seemed bent on pushing him out.

Last week, facing a third impeachment vote, he announced that he was dissolving Congress and creating a new government that would rule by decree.
The move was widely denounced by both opponents and former allies as a coup attempt. Within hours, Mr. Castillo was arrested, Congress voted to impeach him and the vice president, Ms. Boluarte, a former ally, took office.
The events played out at such dizzying speed that many Peruvians struggled to understand what was happening. Now, many of Mr. Castillo’s supporters, particularly in the rural areas that form his base, say that they feel robbed of their vote.
Some protesters expect their movement to grow as the police respond to the demonstrations with what they call a heavy hand. They have made various legal arguments for why Mr. Castillo’s removal was unlawful, and are calling on Ms. Boluarte to move up new elections.

Mr. Castillo is one of several leftist presidents who was swept to power in Latin America in recent years amid deep anger at establishment politicians. Many of these leaders have sought to unite around a common purpose that seeks to address deepening inequality and wrest control from the political elite.
On Monday evening, several of those aligned nations issued a joint statement calling the ousted president “the victim of undemocratic harassment” and urging Peru’s political leaders to respect the “will of the citizens” who voted him in.
The statement, issued by the governments of Colombia, Bolivia, Argentina and Mexico, referred to Mr. Castillo as “president” and made no mention of Ms. Boluarte.
Mexico’s leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, in his morning address to reporters on Tuesday, said his administration would continue to consider Mr. Castillo the leader of Peru “until they resolve it there in terms of legality.”

The relationship between the two nations, he said, was “on pause.”
Last year, Mr. Castillo campaigned on a vow to address poverty and inequality. His motto — “no more poor people in a rich country” — and his call for a rewrite of the constitution energized many rural farmers in a deeply unequal nation where the urban elite vehemently opposed his candidacy.
The protests are backed by the largest federation of labor unions, the largest association of Indigenous people in the Peruvian Amazon and many organizations representing poor farmers, among other groups.
Jaime Borda, who leads Red Muqui, a network of environmental and human rights organizations that work in rural Peru, said the anger in the streets stemmed not just from frustration over Mr. Castillo’s removal but from a larger “discontent of the population for all the accumulated things of these last years,” namely a political system that to many seemed to encourage corruption and serve the elite.
Many protesters, he said, believed that Mr. Castillo had been driven toward political self-destruction by that same elite political class.
Mr. Castillo’s supporters “are very aware that in the end that was not the way to go, to attempt a coup d’état,” he said. “But people also tell you that we have elected him as our representative, we have elected him as our president.”

Cunarc, an association of rural security patrols, is among the groups leading the protests.
Santos Saavedra, Cunarc’s president, said that Ms. Boluarte’s call for dialogue “is going to be impossible, because the population does not recognize the de facto government.”
Victoriano Laura, 48, a miner in the city of La Rinconada, high in the Andes Mountains, said on Tuesday that many people were traveling from La Rinconada to the city of Juliaca, about 100 miles away, to protest.
“People are furious” about the president’s removal, he said. “The violence is starting because of the provocation of the police, and people aren’t going to remain quiet.”
So far, no single leader has emerged to try to unify the disparate groups. Peru has been hobbled by political upheaval and high-level corruption scandals that have led to six presidents since 2016.

In his few public appearances since his arrest on charges of rebellion, Mr. Castillo has defended his actions and shown no regret.
During his second court hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Castillo said that he had been unfairly detained and that he would “never resign.”
“Nor will I abandon this popular cause that brought me here,” he said, before calling on authorities to “stop killing these people who are thirsty for justice,” a reference to the protesters.
When a judge interrupted to ask if he wanted to say anything in his defense, Mr. Castillo responded: “I have not committed the crime of conspiracy or rebellion.”
Mitra Taj reported from Lima, Peru, and Julie Turkewitz and Genevieve Glatsky from Bogotá, Colombia."
2022-12-14,"LIMA, Peru — The government of Peru declared a nationwide state of emergency on Wednesday as it sought to control widespread violence following the ouster last week of the country’s elected president, who had tried to dissolve Congress.
It was an extraordinary turn of events even in a country accustomed to political upheaval and protest.
The emergency measure, which was announced by Alberto Otárola, the country’s defense minister, suspended the rights of assembly and freedom of transit, among other civil liberties, for 30 days. It was signed into law Wednesday evening by the country’s new president, Dina Boluarte, and specified it would be enforced by the national police force with the support of the military. The decree did not impose a curfew.
The move is the most significant government response to a crisis that erupted last Wednesday when the president, Pedro Castillo, tried to disband Congress, which he had been feuding with since taking office last year.
Within hours, Peru’s Congress impeached him and Mr. Castillo was arrested, setting off waves of angry protests by supporters who believe his removal was illegitimate.
Several political analysts said that while past governments have declared states of emergency in certain parts of the country, the measure had not been used this widely since the 1990s, when the country was brutalized by a Marxist terrorist group called the Shining Path.

2022-12-16,"After matching on several dating sites in 2017, Joseph Michael Flaum was becoming increasingly interested in Allison Dana Port. She was feeling overwhelmed, however, not by Mr. Flaum but the barrage of messages she was continually receiving through the apps.
So, when Mr. Flaum, 38, sent Ms. Port, 35, a message, she didn’t respond.
Then, in the early fall of 2019, they matched again. Mr. Flaum still received no response to his message to her. But he wasn’t giving up, deciding instead to contact her through Facebook.
This impressed Ms. Port and messages were exchanged. Their first date on Oct. 15 was at the St Tropez Wine Bar and Restaurant in the West Village near their apartments, which happened to be just a few blocks away from each other.
“We must have crossed paths,” Mr. Flaum said, “but it was more like ships passing in the night.”
Mr. Flaum came into Ms. Port’s life at a crucial time. Her father had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that summer. “I couldn’t imagine having gone through that without him,” she said. “It was like a gift sent from the universe.”

Then Covid struck, and when Ms. Port got the news that her father’s cancer had progressed, she decided to return to her family home in Woodbury, N.Y.
Mr. Flaum also went home to Boca Raton, Fla., to spend time with his family. He bonded with his nieces and nephew while continuing to grow his connection with Ms. Port. Both returned to the city around Memorial Day 2020 but traveled back to their hometowns often. The summer provided a bit of a respite.
During that summer, Ms. Port took Mr. Flaum home to meet her family. Ms. Port’s father took a liking to Mr. Flaum and, before they left, her father pulled her aside. “At this point, I think my dad maybe knew he didn’t have a lot of time and he wanted to make sure I knew that he loved Joe.” He told Ms. Port that Mr. Flaum had his blessing, should they decide to get married.

Back in the city, winter was approaching. And when Ms. Port’s father died on Oct. 25, 2020, the pair wanted an escape. “We were ready to take a break and get some fresh air,” Mr. Flaum said, so they decided to spend the winter skiing and working remotely in Aspen, Colo.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But first, a stop in Florida to see Mr. Flaum’s family for Hanukkah. He watched as Ms. Port embraced his nieces, sometimes holding a girl in each arm. “That was when I was like, ‘Oh, this could be it.’”
The couple stayed in Aspen for “four blissful months” and skied until the final days of the season in T-shirts. They then spent another year in the city, living in a new place in the West Village together.
Ms. Port has a bachelor’s degree in public affairs from Indiana University.  She is a senior account executive at Amazon, working in digital advertising sales. Mr. Flaum received a bachelor’s degree in finance from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania  and is a senior analyst and technology, media, and telecommunications sector head at SPX Capital, a hedge fund.
While the couple was on a ski trip with friends in Switzerland in December 2021, Mr. Flaum planned a surprise. At the mention of a code word — a certain stock ticker — Mr. Flaum’s friend pulled out a camera to capture his mountaintop proposal.
The couple were married Dec. 3 by Rabbi Jonathan Tabachnikoff of Congregation Dor Chadash at Playa Largo Resort and Spa in Key Largo, Fla., before about 150 guests. The ceremony was held on the beach.
The pair included some updated Jewish traditions. “We’re doing the seven circles,” Ms. Port said and described a wedding ritual where a woman walks around a man seven times, “but we’re splitting it and we’re each walking three times around each other and then one time together.”
There were many speeches at the rehearsal dinner but only one at the reception. “I am very lucky that my dad actually wrote a wedding speech before he passed away,” said Ms. Port, who will be taking her husband’s name. Her older brother, Billy Port, read her father’s speech."

What’s Up? (Dec. 11-17)
Criminal Charges for Sam Bankman-Fried
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was expected to appear before the House Committee on Financial Services last Tuesday — one of the many efforts to investigate the exchange’s collapse. But the day before, he was arrested in the Bahamas after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges. He faces eight counts, which include several fraud charges and conspiring to defraud the United States and violate campaign finance laws. Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges, accusing Mr. Bankman-Fried of misleading investors who committed some $2 billion to FTX, among other charges.  It was not long ago that the voluble crypto mogul was discussing his role in the downfall of FTX with reporters at The New York Times and elsewhere.
Musk and Twitter
It began with private planes. Last week, Elon Musk suspended 25 accounts on Twitter that were dedicated to keeping tabs on the planes of government agencies, billionaires and other prominent figures, including Mr. Musk. (His flights were tracked by the account @ElonJet using public data.) Shortly after completing his purchase of Twitter in October, Mr. Musk said he would allow the account to remain on the platform, holding up this move as the apotheosis of free speech. But on Wednesday, Mr. Musk suspended not only @ElonJet but two dozen similar accounts. Soon after, he suspended the accounts of half a dozen journalists who wrote about the suspension of the private-plane trackers or who had written critically about Mr. Musk’s ownership of Twitter. But early Saturday, he said he was reinstating the accounts of several journalists.
Inflation Eases, but the Fed Holds Steady
Inflation data for November brought good news for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, but it wasn’t enough to alter the central bank’s plans to press on with its campaign to raise interest rates. The Consumer Price Index fell to 7.1 percent last month, down from 7.7 in October and far from its most recent peak of 9.1 percent in June. Nonetheless, the day after the release of that data, the Fed made clear that it intended to continue its campaign to cool an overheated economy. Officials did slow the pace of interest rate increases — raising rates by half a percent point instead of three-quarters, the size of the last four consecutive increases — but they signaled that rates would continue to rise in the new year. The Fed is still intent on hitting its target of 2 percent inflation, and Jerome H. Powell, the central bank’s chair, said the plan included “probably high rates, probably held for longer.”

What’s Next? (Dec. 18-24)
Holiday Cheer, Deeply Discounted
Inflation may be beginning to moderate, but the inflationary mind-set persists. For holiday shoppers, that could mean continuing to be more conscious about spending, as recent data about retail sales in November seemed to foretell. U.S. retail sales fell 0.6 percent from October, even with the Thanksgiving rush, when nearly 200 million Americans shopped over a five-day period that included Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Some analysts suggested that customers might be spending more now on travel, entertainment and other in-person experiences and less on traditionally popular gift categories like clothing and sporting goods. Some presents under the tree could be replaced with gift cards or tickets to events, for example. And many consumers will probably continue to seek deep discounts when shopping for loved ones, as they account for tighter budgets than in recent years.

Replenishing the Country’s Oil Reserves
To account for the tightening oil supply that resulted from Western sanctions on Russia, the Biden administration relied heavily this year on tapping the country’s emergency reserves to keep oil flowing and ease prices at the gas pump, particularly ahead of the midterm elections. As a result, the reserve was reduced to its lowest level in four decades after the Energy Department released more than a quarter of its stockpile, or nearly 200 million barrels of crude, since March. Now the White House is preparing to replenish it in the new year: On Friday, the Energy Department announced that it would begin repurchasing crude, starting with three million barrels in February. The department framed the plan as a good deal for American taxpayers, because the administration would be repurchasing the crude at a lower price than it was sold for. The move comes as gas prices continue to moderate; the national average on Friday was about $3.18, according to AAA, below where it was a year earlier. .
Efforts to Halt a Union
Results are expected this week from the National Labor Relations Board on an effort by Amazon to overturn the results of an April union election at the Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8. The unionization effort had been something of a long-shot bid by an independent union. But it clinched a victory by more than 10 percentage points, the first union victory at an Amazon in the United States. In its filing to the N.L.R.B., the company argued that the labor board had conducted the vote unfairly and that the union had used improper methods to secure workers’ support. But a federal labor official who presided over Amazon’s challenge said these claims had little basis. This year, The New York Times reported that Amazon relied on mandatory anti-union sessions to argue that the union had not “delivered for its members” and to provide sometimes misleading information about changes to wages if a union were voted in.
What Else?
The U.S. State Department announced a new round of sanctions on prominent Russians last week. A new report found that a 13-year-old just joining TikTok would encounter recommended posts related to self-harm and eating disorders within 30 minutes. And the latest data from the Personal Consumption Expenditure index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, will be released on Friday."
2022-12-19,
2022-12-20,"WASHINGTON — The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it planned to buy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, creating one of the largest battery-powered fleets in the nation and resolving a long-running dispute with the Biden administration over how quickly the agency should clean up its fleet of iconic white, red and blue mail trucks.
The post office said it would invest $9.6 billion over the next six years to refurbish its aging mail delivery fleet. That includes buying 60,000 delivery vehicles from Oshkosh Defense, a Wisconsin-based company that manufactures military vehicles, of which at least 45,000 will be electric battery-powered. The agency also plans to buy at least 21,000 additional electric vehicles from other manufacturers and intends to stop buying gas-powered delivery trucks altogether after 2026.
President Biden has set a goal of electrifying the federal government's vast fleet of cars and trucks in order to tackle global warming. With more than 231,000 vehicles, the Postal Service owns one of the largest civilian vehicle fleets in the world. Electric vehicles typically produce fewer planet-warming greenhouse gases than their gasoline-powered counterparts, even when taking into account emissions from the power plants that provide their electricity.
Yet until recently, Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, had largely resisted Mr. Biden’s calls to put more electric vehicles on the road, citing high upfront costs and budget constraints.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
When the Postal Service made public a plan in February to replace up to 165,000 older mail trucks, many of which are 30 years old and lack air-conditioning, it announced that only 10 percent of the new vehicles would be electric. The rest would be gasoline-powered and get an estimated 8.6 miles per gallon when the air conditioning was turned on.
The Rise of Electric Vehicles
Affordable Models: More efficient manufacturing, falling battery costs and intense competition are lowering sticker prices for battery-powered vehicles to within striking distance of gasoline cars.
Keeping China Out: President Biden wants to shield American producers of electric vehicles from cheaper Chinese options. Here are the policy and political considerations of Biden’s efforts.
Retiring the Malibu: General Motors said that it would stop making the Chevrolet Malibu, the last affordable sedan in its U.S. model lineup, to produce more electric cars.
Tesla’s Pullback: The automaker led by Elon Musk is no longer planning to take the lead in expanding the number of places to fuel electric vehicles. It’s not clear how quickly other companies will fill the gap.
That triggered a fierce backlash from Biden administration officials and Democrats in Congress, who warned that all those new gasoline-powered trucks would stay on the road for decades, spewing heat-trapping pollution into the air all the while. The White House and the Environmental Protection Agency argued that the plan was based on a flawed environmental analysis. Attorneys general from 16 states and the District of Columbia, along with five environmental groups and the United Auto Workers, sued the agency over the decision.
In July, the Postal Service shifted course and promised that 40 percent of new trucks would be electric. But, Mr. DeJoy said, the agency needed more funding from Congress if it wanted to go further. (Electric vehicles can cost more upfront than gasoline-powered models, though they can often make up the savings on fuel and maintenance costs in subsequent years.)
The breakthrough came in August, when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping tax and climate change law that included $3 billion for the Postal Service to electrify its fleet.
“The $3 billion provided by Congress has significantly reduced the risk associated with accelerating the implementation of a nationwide infrastructure necessary to electrify our delivery fleet,” Mr. DeJoy said in a statement Tuesday. “We have a statutory requirement to deliver mail and packages to 163 million addresses six days per week and to cover our costs in doing so — that is our mission. As I have said in the past, if we can achieve those objectives in a more environmentally responsible way, we will do so.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
White House officials hailed the move. “Moving packages from Point A to Point B in a way that’s cleaner, more cost-effective, and accelerating toward an electric vehicle future stamped ‘Made in America,’” said Ali Zaidi, Mr. Biden’s national climate adviser. “This is the Biden climate strategy on wheels, and the U.S. Postal Service delivering for the American people.”
As part of the new plan, the Postal Service plans to upgrade hundreds of facilities across the country to accommodate electric vehicles, including installing chargers and streamlining its delivery operations to reduce unnecessary trips. And the agency plans to study the feasibility of shifting to 100 percent electric vehicles.
Many of the Postal Service’s competitors are also planning to clean up their fleets. FedEx has said it intends to completely electrify its pickup and delivery fleet by 2040. Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric vans from Rivian, a start-up, though there are questions about how quickly the manufacturer can deliver.
For the time being, the Postal Service isn’t ready to give up fossil fuels altogether. It still plans to buy roughly 40,000 gas-powered vehicles between now and 2028, including vans and trucks that have to travel longer distances between cities and states.
But supporters of electric vehicles said that for many mail routes, electric vehicles should work well, at least in theory. And because mail trucks are ubiquitous, running in both congested cities and quiet rural towns, they could end up being an advertisement for the technology.
“Postal routes are predictable and include ample charging time to meet the fleet’s power needs,” said Joe Britton, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, an electric vehicle trade group. “Transitioning these older, inefficient vehicles to E.V.s will not only serve as a visual reminder of their value and reliability but will also provide public health, environmental, and economic benefits to our communities.”"

The search is on for a new Twitter C.E.O.

Will Twitter’s new boss be the same as the old boss?
Elon Musk has finally spoken about whether he should remain Twitter’s C.E.O. after he polled users earlier this week about the matter. He says he will resign — a majority of respondents to his poll said that he should — but whether he will, or will meaningfully give up power if he does, remain open questions.
And what Mr. Musk ultimately does will resonate beyond Twitter. Investors in Tesla, which he also runs, have grown increasingly agitated about the carmaker’s slumping stock price as he spends more time at the social network.
“I will resign as C.E.O. as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” That was Mr. Musk’s tweet on Tuesday, a day after the poll closed. In some ways, that conclusion wasn’t surprising — he has said before that he doesn’t plan to run Twitter forever (and that he doesn’t like being chief executive of any company, for that matter) — but CNBC reports that Musk was looking for a C.E.O. before he put up the poll.
That said, it isn’t clear how much power the new chief would have:
Mr. Musk clarified on Tuesday that he still planned to oversee Twitter’s software and server teams, which, The Verge notes, is basically a lot of the company. That may mean the C.E.O. would end up overseeing the business side of Twitter, including ads and subscriptions.
And Mr. Musk will continue to own Twitter, making him the ultimate boss to whoever fills the role.
Mr. Musk also openly questioned the quality of anyone applying for the role. Beyond the “foolish” crack in Tuesday’s tweet, he previously wrote, “Those who want power are the ones who least deserve it.”
Tesla investors are anxiously awaiting Mr. Musk’s next steps. The carmaker’s market valuation has now fallen below ExxonMobil’s for the first time in two years. Some Tesla shareholders blame Mr. Musk for being too distracted by Twitter to focus on their company’s challenges, including growing competition and weakening demand for its cars. (Musk himself blames macroeconomic troubles beyond his control.)

In more Musk news:
His effort to raise more equity financing for Twitter — at his original purchase price of $54.20 a share, a level he has said was overvalued — is continuing to, improbably, generate interest.
Here’s whom Mr. Musk was seen hanging out with at the soccer World Cup final in Doha, Qatar, including Jared Kushner and the restaurateur known as Salt Bae.
The police now say they think that a member of Mr. Musk’s security team is a suspect, not a victim, in what the billionaire has said was a “crazy stalker” incident.
Mr. Musk said that he “spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy” at Twitter because the company was on course to see its cash flow balloon to negative $3 billion.

Questions swirl about Bankman-Fried’s future on eve of U.S. return
Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is expected to fly back to the United States on Wednesday to face federal charges in Manhattan that he defrauded investors out of billions, evaded taxes and violated campaign finance rules in donating millions to politicians.
Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30, is expected to seek a deal with prosecutors to be released on bail before his trial — essentially trading his current Bahamian jail stay for house arrest.

FTX’s new management wants to claw back Mr. Bankman-Fried’s political donations in an effort to repay debts. The top 50 creditors alone are owed more than $3 billion after the company racked up losses in excess of $8 billion. (DealBook has previously explained why recouping money for defrauded investors in FTX will be difficult.)

Bankruptcy creditors won’t get a say over Mr. Bankman-Fried’s legal defense fund. Former federal prosecutors told DealBook that creditors cannot argue that he or his family are essentially using ill-gotten gains to fight his costly legal battles. In a criminal case, only prosecutors can object to legal payments and only if they believe that money tied to the alleged crimes is financing the defense. That’s a hard point to argue: Judges tend not to rule against the defendant on matters involving defense funds, according to legal experts.
Whether Mr. Bankman-Fried will ultimately be able to afford his lawyers is another question. Experts estimate that defending him will cost millions of dollars and could drag on for years.
Here’s what else is happening in crypto:
Lawyers representing FTX creditors with $1.6 billion in claims have begun demanding preferential treatment in bankruptcy court.

The likely end of negative rates jostles global markets
European stocks and U.S. futures are rebounding this morning — but it’s another story altogether in the bond market. Investors are selling U.S. Treasury bills and German bonds, known as bunds, while, for a second straight day, the yield on the two-year Japanese treasury note hovered just above zero. All of this has prompted some market watchers to say goodbye to the negative rates era.
The Bank of Japan prompted a global sell-off in sovereign debt. On its face, the B.O.J.’s decision on Tuesday to relax its bond-yield policy seemed small. It will allow its treasury yield to fluctuate by 0.5 percent rather than 0.25 percent. But that signaled to the market that Japan’s central bankers would join their global peers in raising interest rates.
The effect: For the first time since 2015, all Japanese government-issued bonds have been trading mostly above zero during the past 24 hours.
Japan is an outlier among the world’s biggest economies. With inflation at 3.6 percent, well below its largest trading partners, its short-term interest rate has remained at negative 0.1 percent. Looking for a decent return on their investment portfolios, Japanese investors have instead “hoarded their cash offshore,” George Saravelos, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said in an investor note this morning.
Saravelos estimates that Japanese investors, having accumulated $100 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated assets in the past 12 months alone, will now shift their focus to buying more Japanese bonds and yen, dumping their foreign holdings.

2022-12-22,"Almost everything was as usual at the Sbarro in Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan on Saturday night — the rumble of the 1 train could be heard and the aroma of greasy pizza was thick in the air. But something out of the ordinary was taking place at the pizzeria, part of a chain typically disdained by New Yorkers: a night of erotic readings.
“To be clear, this is not at all ironic,” said Matt Starr, one of the event’s organizers. “We wanted to take something that people typically do or read in private and bring it into a public, shared setting.”
Mr. Starr and Zack Roif, both 33, are the creators of a young series called the Perverted Book Club. The concept is simple, if unorthodox: Artists and writers read aloud (or in some cases, perform) selected works that loosely fit under the umbrella of erotica. Pieces read have included Amazon sex toy reviews, Beatles fan fiction and raunchy vintage love letters.
The reading at the Sbarro was Mr. Starr and Mr. Roif’s second. At their first — at Blue Door Video, an old porn shop in the East Village of Manhattan — one audience member passed out because of the steamy nature of one of the readings, according to Mr. Starr.
Mr. Starr said they hoped to host each Perverted Book Club gathering in a “nontraditional reading space.” That means no to bookstores, galleries and trendy bars, but yes to fast-food joints, sex shops and department stores — essentially, anywhere you wouldn’t expect to find New York’s literary scene.

A Sbarro pizzeria beneath Penn Station certainly seems to meet Matt Starr’s standard of a “nontraditional reading space.”

2022-12-23,"I don’t remember who gave me the hard plastic bug with the mesmerizing light-up wings and the only infant-toy melody I’ve never gotten sick of. But I do remember how they described it: Like a drug for babies.
I was given it six years ago when I became a parent. The Bright Starts Beaming Buggie Take-Along Toy, its formal name, became the magic weapon against my daughter’s most intense crying fits, when her little face turned crimson, her breathing barely able to keep up with her screams, expressing a despair that seemed impossibly deep for a person so new to the world. I would turn on the hand-size Buggie and the sweet lullaby combined with the shimmering wings would reliably quiet her sobs as she took in the musical light show. Once she was asleep, I could switch the noise to the sound of ocean waves. Best of all, the Buggie had a clip to attach to the car seat, keeping it hanging and humming right in the center of my daughter’s view, so I could drive without the distracting sound of her misery.
I think of this bug whenever it is time to buy gifts for new parents. No other method worked so well to calm my own child, so I have given it out dozens of times as a present. “It worked magnificently during a diaper change just now — amazing; we are in your debt,” said one new father in a typical message of gratitude. I saw another mother on YouTube who tracked how long “the magic bee” took to stop her baby’s tears: 43 seconds.
But earlier this year, when a colleague was expecting, I went to buy the Beaming Buggie and discovered it was out of stock on Amazon, Target and Walmart, the places it typically sold for around $12.99. I thought it was a pandemic supply chain issue and waited a few months, but it remained unstocked. I found it selling on eBay for around $100, but couldn’t bring myself to spend that much.

As the babies kept coming, and the Beaming Buggie remained unavailable, I began to worry. When one of my closest friends gave birth this summer, I packaged up my daughter’s original bug, so well used that I had to make a handwritten guide to the buttons because their markings had worn away. “Thank you for the magic baby soother,” my friend messaged me soon after.
Each season has its own It toy. (My daughter, now in elementary school, is clamoring for L.O.L. Surprise dolls, a thing we did not know existed last Christmas.) I am generally aware of trends, but had not comprehended that a toy for babies, a demographic I think of as rather static, would go out of style. When it dawned on me that this beloved and seemingly essential toy was no longer being made, I tracked down the company behind it to find out why.
The Bright Starts brand is made by Atlanta-based Kids 2, a family-owned company that targets the newborn-to-2 market. Kids 2 also owns Baby Einstein, a brand I recognized from a ubiquitous colorful boom box that plays classical melodies, songs that I tired of far more quickly than my beloved Buggie’s melody.
Kids 2 does not sell its toys directly to consumers, instead distributing through retailers. Each of its brands has a philosophy, said Jill Waller, the company’s head of global product and innovation. Bright Starts is about inspiring joy and Baby Einstein is about encouraging curiosity.
Ms. Waller officially broke the news to me: The Bright Starts Beaming Buggie line was dead. Introduced in 2015, it had been retired in 2020, “which is a pretty good run for a toy,” she said. “Most toys last about two or three years.”

It was not, however, as good a run as the Baby Einstein Take-along Tunes; that classical boom box has been on sale since 2010 and remains a top seller today, Ms. Waller said. Oddly, I was affronted that the masses had bestowed this honor on a different toy.
Like many parents, I am oddly attached to the gear that has worked for me, becoming an evangelist for a particular brand of stroller and a specific line of changing pads that were easy to clean. Much like a sports fanatic, I could not understand how others failed to love my favorite player.
“There are classic toys — wooden toys and games like Monopoly,” said Roberta Golinkoff, a developmental psychologist and professor at the University of Delaware who studies playful learning. “But toy companies are like any other business. They want people to buy stuff so they come up with a better version to get parents to spend their dollars.”
Ms. Waller could not say exactly why the Buggie was retired, but suggested that it had to do with baby product industry trends and a move toward softer, more huggable toys that are more “character driven.” Like a favorite sneaker discontinued by an athletic brand, a retired toy will usually have a successor in the same line, Ms. Waller said. For the Beaming Buggie, it is the Hugabye Elephant or the Huggin’ Lights, which debuts in the new year. The company sent me a sample of the latter, a softer, more squeezable musical toy, which comes in elephant and lion forms. It did not charm me the way the Buggie did, though it fared reasonably well in a test with its target audience. During a fussy session, a colleague’s 7-month-old baby was intrigued if not obsessed by it. (A generally cheerful baby, she usually enjoys baby maracas and toys featuring crinkly paper.) The lion’s light show was not as spectacular as the Buggie’s, which was the company’s first foray into edge lighting, nor was its melody as soothing. The Buggie’s tune was created by a Scottish video game music composer.
I sent my colleague a video of the original Buggie. “Wow the OG looks magical,” she replied. “Why would they stop making it!!!!!”

“I don’t think there’s any kind of anti-bug movement,” Ms. Waller said. “The lightning bug is super cute …” — until that moment, I had thought it was a bee or butterfly — “ … but yeah, just getting more aligned with the trends in nursery.”
The consumer is not ultimately the baby, explained Ms. Waller and her colleague Rochelle Wainer, a child and developmental psychologist. It’s the parents who do the buying, so the company analyzes what the current generation of child-rearers wants.
“Millennial parents care about how things look in their homes,” Ms. Wainer said. The nursery must be Instagrammable with wooden toys in neutral colors or a whimsical play tent in an inoffensive gray shade. Gen Z, meanwhile, seems more interested in toys that will go viral on TikTok, such as Squishmallows, round pillow-like stuffies that come in an assortment of characters.
I asked if it was the hard yellow plastic frame that did my preferred toy in. Ms. Waller said plastics were still popular despite consumers’ expressed desire for sustainable materials, such as wood and fabric. “I will tell you that the plastic toy industry is not going anywhere,” Ms. Waller said. “That is not how they’re buying.”
(Dr. Golinkoff, the professor who studies child play, confirmed that American parents “love anything with a battery.”)

Kids 2 runs surveys and panels to help decide what new toys it should design, and subscribes to trend forecasting agencies such as WGSN and Trend Bible to figure out what colors, patterns and themes are going to appeal. Plant patterns are big right now, Ms. Waller said. “Aloe plants and cacti,” she said. “There’s just something kind of homey and cozy about houseplants.”
As a parent, I’ve noticed this: all of a sudden a surprising animal will suddenly be everywhere in the kid section. In recent years, it has been the flamingo, the sloth, the llama and, of course, the longstanding unicorn.
“There was a narwhal moment,” Ms. Waller said, and my mind flashed to the many stuffed narwhals around my home, many in rainbow hues, my children’s desires shaped, ultimately, by what toy companies choose to sell.
Disappointingly, I could not get Ms. Waller to explain precisely why Kids 2 had smushed the Bug. Reading between the lines of our conversation, though, it was clear that my many purchases for newborns had not been enough to lift its sales numbers to the point where retailers insisted the company continue to supply it.

Vox Populi, Vox Musk
Elon Musk said that he would resign as Twitter’s chief executive once he found a successor “foolish enough to take the job.” Last weekend, after he faced backlash over unpopular content moderation policies and suspensions of high-profile users, including some journalists, Mr. Musk asked his nearly 123 million Twitter followers in a “poll” whether he should resign, saying he would abide by the results of the vote. Fifty-seven percent of the 17.5 million respondents said “Yes.” After a notable silence, Mr. Musk said on Tuesday he would step down as chief executive — though he added that he still planned to oversee Twitter’s software and server teams. Mr. Musk has shown an affinity for polls in the past. When asking for users’ input on decisions, Mr. Musk has posted “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” which roughly means that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
Sports and the Streaming Wars
YouTube beat out bids from Apple and Amazon to acquire the rights for the National Football League’s Sunday Ticket package of games. YouTube has agreed to pay the league about $2.5 billion per year, about a $1 billion bump from DirecTV, the previous rights holder. The deal will allow people to stream nearly all of the N.F.L. games on YouTube next season. The exact timeline of the deal is unclear, but YouTube and the N.F.L. called it a “multiyear deal.” Apple recently dropped out of the race for the rights, opting instead to sponsor the 2023 halftime show — a performance by Rihanna.
Zuckerberg’s Day in Court
When a lawyer asked Mark Zuckerberg whether Meta, the parent company of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, was “trying to shape the future of technology,” he hesitated and then replied: “Yes. That’s a fairly broad statement, but yes.” Mr. Zuckerberg appeared as the star witness in federal court in San Jose, Calif., on Tuesday. The case will determine whether the Federal Trade Commission will be granted an injunction to block Meta’s $400 million acquisition of Within, a company that makes a virtual reality fitness game. If the F.T.C. blocks the acquisition (originally announced in 2021), it could set a precedent for antitrust law.
What’s Next? (Dec. 25-31)
A new year — and who knows!
In the lead-up to the new year, economists and officials are trying to predict what may come next for the economy. But the future, as Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, said this month of the possibility of a recession, is “not knowable.” That’s true in any year, and especially now, in our current economic climate. The economy has upended forecasts and defied usual patterns over the past couple of years. Historical data, which is generally useful for those who make economic predictions, has not proved a reliable guide. In 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s in an attempt to slow growth and bring price increases under control. It remains to be seen just what effect those rate changes will have in the year to come.

Last month, the disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried told The New York Times’s Andrew Ross Sorkin that he was having “a bad month.” He has had another bad month since then — he was arrested in the Bahamas and held in a notorious prison — and is probably looking at more “bad months” ahead. Mr. Bankman-Fried, who was extradited from the Bahamas to New York on Wednesday, has been charged with two counts of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy related to securities fraud, money laundering and violating campaign finance laws. He was released on bond and will stay with his parents in California while awaiting trial. Meanwhile, his one-time colleagues Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang are cooperating in the federal criminal case against him. Other associates may follow: The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York urged FTX employees to come forward.
ChatGPT raises alarms
ChatGPT, an experimental chatbot, could shake up everything from big tech to homework assignments in the new year. The chat bot technology, which was released by OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab, serves information in clear sentences. Already, Google is keeping a close eye on what happens next. The tech behemoth’s management declared a “code red” over ChatGPT, which could present an existential threat to Google’s search business. And this may be just the beginning; OpenAI is said to be working on a better model that could be released next year.

Re “Growing Network of Conservative Groups Is Fueling Book Bans” (front page, Dec. 13):
Do these parents really believe that the moral code they teach to their children is so fragile that the presence of a book on a library shelf will threaten it? Do they take no responsibility for talking with their children about the diversity of life and how their personal morals fit in?
A personal moral code is complex, and the most powerful influence is from the home. But even then no one can force anyone to believe something that does not fit their values or sense of self.
A book alone cannot force someone to behave in a manner that contradicts their morals. And banning books will not eliminate the ideas and voices of the people who wrote them. The ideas are out there in the conversations young people have every day.
The world is a diverse place. And eventually these “innocent children” will leave home and form their own moral code, sometimes despite what they may have been taught at home.

As a young boy growing up in Los Angeles in the 1950s, I was fascinated by the New York gangsters I read about in a book called “Murder, Inc.” But my father, who had grown up in Brooklyn in the 1920s and had gone to school with some of the most infamous characters in the book, was not amused.
He made me return the book to the library. He did not, however, demand that the library get rid of the book, nor did he launch a campaign to ban all books about organized crime.
A changing climate, a changing world
Card 1 of 4
Climate change around the world: In “Postcards From a World on Fire,” 193 stories from individual countries show how climate change is reshaping reality everywhere, from dying coral reefs in Fiji to disappearing oases in Morocco and far, far beyond.
The role of our leaders: Writing at the end of 2020, Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, found reasons for optimism in the Biden presidency, a feeling perhaps borne out by the passing of major climate legislation. That doesn’t mean there haven’t been criticisms. For example, Charles Harvey and Kurt House argue that subsidies for climate capture technology will ultimately be a waste.
The worst climate risks, mapped: In this feature, select a country, and we'll break down the climate hazards it faces. In the case of America, our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths.
What people can do: Justin Gillis and Hal Harvey describe the types of local activism that might be needed, while Saul Griffith points to how Australia shows the way on rooftop solar. Meanwhile, small changes at the office might be one good way to cut significant emissions, writes Carlos Gamarra.
My father was exercising his parental rights, trying to protect his children from material he considered inappropriate. Activist groups like Florida Citizens Alliance are more interested in imposing their personal beliefs on other people’s children.
Their next step may well be into the grown-up world, attempting to ban all books that do not align with their strict agenda. It wouldn’t be the first time in history.

I was born in a country where state worship is the national sport, uniting left and right, government and opposition. And so it was eye-opening for me to discover, upon arriving in the U.S. 49 years ago, that the founding fathers took wide-ranging precautions to prevent the tyranny of the center, investing the periphery with unparalleled powers.
What they apparently did not anticipate, I am now discovering, is the tyranny of the periphery. The government’s power to decree what books students should and should not read in my native Turkey is replaced here with local yahoos decreeing what students should and should not read.
Add to that local boards’ capricious decisions not to certify elections, local legislatures’ power to gerrymander electoral districts, and the authority recently given to private individuals to discriminate against others based on their loosely defined “religious beliefs,” and I am beginning to wonder if this great bastion of democracy is anything but that!

I find it hard to take comments like “this is not about banning books, it’s about protecting the innocence of our children” seriously.
Our children learn shelter-in-place and active-shooter drills from kindergarten onward, and these same parents are not rallying around bans on assault rifles.

Allowing children to browse through the thousands of library books available and expand their minds does not destroy their innocence. Yet knowing that their school could be next, and that they could become the next victim, shatters not just innocence but lives as well.
These conservative groups are specifically targeting books by or about Black and L.G.B.T.Q. people. Calling it parental rights to shield their children is a poor excuse to hide their bigotry.

Re “Big Oil Companies Are Bullies That ‘Want to Be Seen as Good Guys,’” by David Wallace-Wells (Opinion, nytimes.com, Dec. 15):
Representative Ro Khanna of California’s comments about Big Oil’s role in prolonging the climate crisis are timely and necessary. These companies should be held accountable. But Congress’s approach is allowing a vast number of companies that use huge amounts of energy to pass the buck.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
For the past 10 years, Big Oil has recognized the need for fundamental research and has provided significant funding to universities to develop radically new energy technologies. These efforts have often been criticized as greenwashing. But what have the other giants of American industry done? They have largely passed the buck, continue to do so and remain out of the line of sight of Congress.
When tech giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft make net-zero promises, who are they expecting to create the necessary technologies? Just buying some carbon credits won’t cut it.
We need investment in clean energy research from the demand-side companies generating significant emissions from fossil fuels. To address the climate crisis, we need everybody at the table and held accountable, not just Big Oil.

Re “It’s Time to Say ‘Put Down That Burger,’” by Michael Grunwald (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 18):
Putting down the burger is still dancing around the elephant in the room. Yes we need to eat less meat and return ranch land to nature. Yes we need to clean up our agricultural practices. And of course we should stop wasting food and clean our plates as baby boomer children were taught by Depression-era parents.
But once again there was no mention of why we need to produce so much food in the first place. We have produced too many people! We humans have exceeded our carrying capacity. We’ve unbalanced the balance of nature. And that appears to be the most uncomfortable topic of all.

Haworth, N.J."
2022-12-27,"Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.” And for the last two years, labor leaders have often lauded him for delivering on that promise.
They cite appointees who are sympathetic to unions and a variety of pro-labor measures, like a pandemic relief bill that included tens of billions to shore up union pension funds.
But in recent weeks, after Mr. Biden helped impose a contract on railroad workers that four unions had rejected, partly over its lack of paid sick days, many labor activists and scholars have begun to ask: How supportive is the president, really?
To those reassessing Mr. Biden, the concern is that the president, by asking Congress to intervene and avert a strike, missed a rare opportunity to improve workers’ bargaining power in ways that could extend beyond the rail sector. They worry that the move essentially validated an employer strategy of waiting out workers in hopes that the pressure would fizzle.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Whether this group of workers has sick days or not on some level was not the issue,” said Kim Phillips-Fein, a historian at Columbia University who studies labor. “It was: What can people ask for and expect to win through collective action?”
That Mr. Biden did not take a stronger stand, she added, “suggested a political blindness to what was really at stake.”
At heart, the railroad episode has stirred a debate over what it means to be a pro-labor president.
Defenders see Mr. Biden as unusually outspoken on behalf of workers’ rights. They cite his declaration during a unionization vote at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama that “there should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats” — an unusual if carefully worded gesture of presidential solidarity — and his dismay that Kellogg planned to permanently replace striking workers.
“He has helped create a mood in the country as it relates to unions that has helped propel the extraordinary organizing going on,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which organized the unsuccessful drive at the Alabama warehouse and is challenging the result. Mr. Appelbaum added that Mr. Biden’s announcement during the campaign was “beyond what we’d hoped for.”
The president’s backers also point to a raft of labor-friendly regulations and legislation. Mr. Biden issued an executive order requiring so-called project labor agreements on federal construction projects above $35 million — agreements with unions that set wages and work rules — and the major climate and health bill he signed created incentives for clean energy projects to pay wages similar to union rates.

Celeste Drake, a senior White House labor adviser, said in a statement that Mr. Biden had made “lasting strides for workers and unions” and that many of his achievements were “passed on a razor’s edge of tight margins in Congress, often with Republican votes, where the president’s advocacy for unions as a means to rebuilding the middle class could have jeopardized everything.” (More than 70 percent of Americans approve of labor unions, according to a recent Gallup poll.)
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
Liz Shuler, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who was the labor federation’s second-ranking official during the Obama presidency, said Mr. Biden’s administration had been far more solicitous of labor than the previous Democratic president, whom labor leaders sometimes criticized for backing free trade deals and contentious changes in education policy.
“For the decisions made in the Obama administration, labor was often an afterthought,” Ms. Shuler said. “It’s the polar opposite with Biden. We’re included at the table ahead of time, before decisions are made.”
Even the railway labor situation, in which Mr. Biden urged Congress to enact a contract that included significant wage gains and improvements in health benefits, ended up more favorable to workers than it probably would have under another administration, union officials say.
The alternative view of Mr. Biden, put forth by many labor historians and activists, is that while the president has in fact been more obliging to unions and maintained better relationships with union leaders than his recent Democratic predecessors, the difference is one of degree rather than kind.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
They say that like his predecessors, Mr. Biden effectively seeks to manage the long-term decline of labor in a relatively humane way — by making favorable appointments and enacting measures that help at the margins — but has yet to take the sorts of risks that would restore power to workers.
Mr. Biden has “gestured in interesting ways in certain moments,” said Gabriel Winant, a labor historian at the University of Chicago. “But it doesn’t seem like he has the stomach to see the gestures through.”
For those who subscribe to this view, the rail labor dispute was a telling encapsulation of Mr. Biden’s approach: an instance in which the administration worked closely with many leaders of the dozen unions representing rail workers but angered portions of the rank and file. Members of four unions voted down the deal that the administration had helped broker but were not allowed to strike for a better one.
Administration officials say that while Mr. Biden strongly supports the right to strike, the potential costs to the economy, which the industry said could be more than $2 billion per day, were simply too high to allow rail workers to walk off the job. They point out that a strike could have also posed health and safety risks — for example, by halting shipments of chemicals that ensure clean drinking water.

But to critics, these risks were in some sense the point: They provided workers with a rare moment of leverage. They say Mr. Biden could have simply refused to sign any legislation that didn’t include paid sick days, then made clear that rail carriers were to blame for any disruption if they refused.

“Biden in this case revealed that I’m your friend, but I won’t risk anything for you,” said Joseph A. McCartin, a historian at Georgetown University who has written extensively about transportation labor disputes.
And if taking a more forceful stand on behalf of rail workers was high risk, Mr. McCartin said, it was also high reward: Because transportation infrastructure touches almost every part of the country, labor relations in that sector tend to reverberate widely.
“Everybody sees it, everybody watches, everybody’s affected,” he said. An open letter to Mr. Biden last month, signed by Mr. McCartin and more than 400 other scholars, said federal interventions in transportation labor disputes “can set the tone for entire eras.”
The letter cited the government’s move to grant rail workers an eight-hour workday to avoid a strike during World War I, which paved the way for similar gains by other workers in the 1930s. By contrast, the letter said, President Ronald Reagan’s firing of striking air traffic controllers in the early 1980s helped undermine the leverage of workers across the economy for decades.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The contention among critics is that by effectively depriving rail workers of the right to strike, Mr. Biden has made it more difficult for other workers to use that tool — and, ultimately, to reverse the movement’s long-term decline.
Strikes with strong backing from union membership “are the only way to win standard-setting contracts, and winning standard-setting contracts is the only way to rebuild the labor movement,” said Jane McAlevey, a scholar and longtime organizer. Her coming book, “Rules to Win By: Power and Participation in Union Negotiations,” documents the importance of aggressive labor actions in improving pay and working conditions.
Workers and organizers at the forefront of recent union campaigns at companies like Starbucks and Amazon said they worried that Mr. Biden’s intervention in the rail labor dispute sent employers a message that the federal government would not punish them for anti-union behavior.
“Everyone understands the significance of the president getting involved,” said Christian Smalls, the president of the Amazon Labor Union, which won an election to represent workers at a Staten Island warehouse in April. “To claim you’re the most pro-union president in history and do something like this contradicts everything.” (Amazon has challenged the union’s victory.)
In some respects, it may have been unrealistic for labor activists to expect that Mr. Biden, who has carried himself as a middle-of-the-road Democrat for much of his career, would depart from the basic model of labor relations that has long prevailed in his party.

But during the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden and some of his senior advisers discussed ways in which they hoped to break with longstanding economic orthodoxy in Washington, with its emphasis on free markets and a small role for government.
Those who support more populist-minded policies say Mr. Biden has delivered in certain ways: enacting subsidies for domestic manufacturing and restrictions on trade with China and appointing regulators who have frequently gone to court to block large mergers.
“There obviously has been progress made,” said Oren Cass, a former Republican policy aide and the founder of American Compass, which seeks to make conservatism more supportive of workers.
Yet when it comes to labor, some say Mr. Biden has been less willing to rethink the reigning economic model.
“If Biden had intervened in a way that was more favorable and sympathetic to the rail workers, that would have been a sign of him really breaking with that model, and the model itself no longer seeming to fit the current moment,” said Ms. Phillips-Fein, the Columbia historian. “That it didn’t happen suggests the limits of his political imagination.”"

“The number and spread of reports that reached us indicates that at least some managers were aggressively pressured to apply a quota” on a process that could lead to employees getting negative ratings and potentially losing their jobs, five workers and employee representatives wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times.
The letter signaled how some Google employees are increasingly interpreting recent management decisions as warnings that the company may be angling to conduct broader layoffs. From the impending closure of a small office and the cancellation of a content-moderation project to various efforts to ease budgets during 2023 planning meetings, the Silicon Valley behemoth has become a tinderbox of anxiety, according to interviews with 14 current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
In some cases, Google employees have reacted to a program that the company began in July to simplify operations, cut red tape and make itself more productive. In other instances, they have had budget conversations, with some teams unable to hire more next year, the people said. And workers have also fretted over decisions made months ago that, to some, have taken on new meaning, they said.

The worries have grown as Google’s tech industry peers have handed out pink slips amid a souring global economy. Last month, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, purged its ranks by 11,000, or about 13 percent of its work force. Amazon also began laying off about 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs, or about 3 percent of its corporate employees.
Even Google, which is on track to make tens of billions of dollars in profits this year, has had to come to terms with a slowdown. In October, as the digital advertising market slumped, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reported that profit dropped 27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to $13.9 billion.
Google did not comment on employee anxiety in a response to a request from The Times. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said in October that the company would “focus on a clear set of product and business priorities.” He also said it would slow hiring and “moderate” the growth of its expenses.
Unlike other big tech companies, Google has so far avoided large-scale job cuts. Still, investors have pushed the company to become more aggressive about “defending” its huge profits, said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI.
“One of the most obvious ways to do that is to cut costs and reduce your employee head count,” he said. He added that it was “kind of odd” that Google’s parent had hired 30,000 employees in the last three quarters, given the economic trends. At the end of September, Alphabet had 186,779 workers.

In recent months, Google has appeared to pay more attention to costs. In July, it started the program to streamline operations. Soon after, it canceled some projects, including the Pixelbook laptop and Stadia, its streaming platform for video games. It has also reduced funding for Area 120, an in-house product incubator.
At one recent meeting, a Google human resources representative told a worker that the company would revisit the possibility of broader layoffs in the new year, and that it was a decision for Mr. Pichai, according to an audio recording obtained by The Times.
Google has told other employees that it would put a priority on trimming real estate expenditures, travel costs and perks before it pursued layoffs, said a person familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The company plans to close a small office in Farmington Hills, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, next month.

Project cancellations and reorganizations have stoked nervousness. In September, Google’s YouTube shut down a project based in the Farmington Hills office with nearly 80 workers, laying off some staff members who did not find new roles at the company, four people familiar with the decision said. YouTube had hired them as contract workers to moderate content on the video platform. Google said 14 workers had lost their jobs.

Google said that through these types of reorganizations, it was not looking to reduce the size of its overall work force, but that some teams might eliminate roles as the company reassessed its priorities.

Some teams that consistently grew in the past will be unable to hire more people next year, four people familiar with the situation said. There are also higher demands for 2023 planning, such as a manager’s being asked to draft plans on how to handle 10 different budget scenarios instead of three or four, one person said. In planning discussions, leaders have pressed managers to justify their expenses, asking if there are workarounds or team reorganizations that could save money, two people said.
One of the biggest concerns for some employees has been whether Google could use its new performance-evaluation system to accelerate job cuts. In May, the company installed the new system, called Googler Reviews and Development.
Under the system, managers expect the bottom 2 percent of employees to be categorized as having “not enough impact,” according to two people familiar with the matter. Another 4 percent should be judged as providing “moderate impact.”
Concerns have intensified that the bottom 6 percent, or roughly 11,000 people, could be targeted for dismissal, according to four people, and as earlier reported by the tech news site The Information.

The GRAD system means Google now has two categories for employees who are considered low performing, compared with one under the old program, potentially leading to a bigger pool of workers at the bottom. The system has also had a bumpy rollout, with managers and employees confused about how it should work, according to the letter and four employees.
Google said it expected workers would become more comfortable with the system over time. It added that it had a no-surprises policy, meaning employees would know well in advance if their performance was falling short.
Before handing out the two lowest ratings, managers are also supposed to notify employees in “support check-in” meetings. Google said not every such meeting would lead to a lower rating, with support check-ins also held for those who need extra help to meet their obligations.
Employees would also have indications if their manager wanted to put them on a “performance improvement” plan, the company said, a process that compels workers to improve their work within 60 days to keep their jobs. Google has given workers the choice of staying on a performance-improvement plan or resigning with a buyout package.
Google said that it had not made changes to increase the number of performance plans, and that it had offered these types of severance options for years.

This month’s letter from some of Google’s workers in Switzerland to Fiona Cicconi, the vice president of human resources, was led by members of a 15-person employee representation committee, ER-CH.
One of their primary concerns was that contrary to what some Google executives have said, the company may have a quota for the number of employees who were supposed to have support check-ins, and whose jobs might therefore be vulnerable.
Google said it had not imposed a quota on support check-ins. But when almost no one used these meetings after the GRAD system was put in place, it said, it asked leaders to convey the importance of the meetings to managers.
The memo signatories in Switzerland also said there was confusion, among managers and workers alike, about who qualified for a support check-in. They urged Ms. Cicconi to put guardrails in place so that the system did not lead to mass firings.
“It’s normal that new processes don’t run smoothly in the beginning, but this should not happen at the expense of Googlers’ well-being, careers and compensation,” they wrote."

2022-12-30,"In a down year for stocks, the 65 percent drop in Tesla’s share price stands out for the scale of wealth vaporized and the unorthodox behavior of its chief executive, Elon Musk.
The collapse of Tesla’s stock price destroyed about $672 billion in market value. And Mr. Musk, once hailed as a genius who remade the car industry, appears increasingly distracted by his acquisition of Twitter and is using the social network to vent his frustrations. He insulted one of his critics this week by describing him as having “tiny testicles.”
The spectacle has stunned investors and analysts. And many are asking what will happen to the stock, the company and Mr. Musk in 2023. The answer largely depends on Mr. Musk and Tesla’s board of directors.
Will he return his attention to Tesla and its myriad challenges? Or will he remain camped out at Twitter? Will Mr. Musk sell more Tesla shares to keep Twitter going after spending $44 billion to buy that company, despite promising not to? Will the Cybertruck, Tesla’s first new passenger vehicle in three years, finally be available for sale? And, perhaps most important, will Tesla’s board do anything to rein in Mr. Musk?

In a deteriorating economy, these uncertainties have forced investors to fundamentally re-evaluate Tesla’s prospects. It remains the most valuable car company and the only major automaker regarded as a growth stock. But investors are no longer convinced that Tesla can dominate the auto industry the way that Apple dominates smartphones or Amazon rules online retailing.
“The promise of Tesla was that at some point all of the cars in the world would be electric vehicles, and Tesla would play a major role in that,” said Efraim Benmelech, a professor of finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.
But, he added, investors have reassessed that view and now seem to think that traditional carmakers like Ford Motor and General Motors will be able to pose a credible competitive challenge to Tesla.
“Some of those companies have been around for 100 years,” said Mr. Benmelech, who uses Tesla as a case study in his classes. “They have good engineers, good management. One should not underestimate the role that competition plays.”
Mr. Benmelech points out that, by most standard measures, Tesla is doing pretty well. The company has reduced its debt and has some of the highest profit margins in the business. It reported a net profit of $8.9 billion in the first nine months of 2022, more than General Motors earned.

This week, there were signs that the share price was stabilizing. The shares rose to $123 on Friday from a two-year low of $109 on Wednesday.
Because many investors compare Tesla to technology companies, it must fulfill loftier expectations than more established automakers. That is why it is still worth roughly $389 billion, compared with about $226 billion for Toyota.

In retrospect, it is clear that Tesla’s stock market valuation of more than $1 trillion at the beginning of the year was overblown, analysts say. Some of the spectacular rise in Tesla’s share price in 2020 and 2021 was probably driven by investors hoping that the company would make them as rich as it had others who bought shares in the company in 2017 when it was worth $40 billion (and considered by some skeptics at the time to be wildly expensive).
“There are times when Tesla looked like it could make someone a millionaire in short order,” said William Goetzmann, a professor of finance at the Yale School of Management who studies asset prices.

That optimism became more difficult to sustain as a series of problems emerged during 2022. Temporary shutdowns at Tesla’s factory in Shanghai because of rising Covid cases, along with intense competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers, cast doubt on Tesla’s chances to dominate electric car sales in that country, the world’s largest auto and electric car market. The Shanghai factory is Tesla’s largest, accounting for 40 percent of its total production.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Tesla is expected to release its fourth-quarter and full-year sales data in the next few days. Wall Street analysts are expecting that the company delivered 420,000 cars in the last three months of the year, up from 343,000 in the third quarter. That would be impressive but not enough for the company to meet its goal of increasing sales 50 percent for the full year.
Rising interest rates were a problem for all automakers, and especially companies, like Tesla, whose vehicles typically sell for more than $50,000. Higher rates mean higher monthly payments that many buyers cannot afford.
Even if rate increases by the Federal Reserve and other central banks were beyond Mr. Musk’s control, analysts faulted him for not paying enough attention to Tesla at a critical moment.

Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has long been optimistic about Tesla’s prospects, probably spoke for many investors when he suggested 10 things Mr. Musk could do to revive the company’s share price. High on the list: Name a new chief executive of Twitter and “focus attention back on Tesla, not on Twitter.”
Investors and analysts are divided on how much Mr. Musk’s utterances on Twitter have tarnished Tesla’s image among the left-leaning consumers most likely to buy an electric car. Even putting those concerns aside, Mr. Musk’s behavior has highlighted the lack of checks and balances at Tesla. The company’s board of directors, whose members include the chief executive’s brother, Kimbal Musk, has largely been silent.
Last month, when several directors testified in a Delaware court in a lawsuit challenging Mr. Musk’s giant compensation package, they said they were unconcerned about how much time the executive was spending at Twitter. “He will do whatever he needs to achieve the results,” Robyn Denholm, Tesla’s chairwoman, said on the witness stand.
Tesla, Mr. Musk, Ms. Denholm and Kimbal Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
Len Sherman, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School who previously worked as a consultant to the auto industry, said Tesla’s board had been exceedingly deferential to Mr. Musk.
“You have no effective governance to rein in his worst impulses,” Mr. Sherman said. “He runs his show the way he wants to run it, and no one can stop him.”

Mr. Sherman, who drives a Tesla and previously owned Tesla stock, is among those who have begun to question whether Mr. Musk is the right person to run the company as it becomes a mature carmaker. He noted that there had been no mention recently of plans to build a $25,000 car that would attract more customers and drive up sales.
“That’s not how you go from where Tesla is now to becoming the next G.M. or Volkswagen,” Mr. Sherman said. “For all his admirable traits, being the only human being on the planet to accomplish what he did, he’s not ideal for the kind of leader Tesla needs going forward.”
With its visionary leader seemingly disengaged, Tesla is being scrutinized according to more conventional standards like revenue and profits and less according to dreams of world domination.
“Now that the cars are ubiquitous,” Mr. Goetzmann of Yale said, “it had to make a transition at some time in its history to not being based on long term prospects but on sales figures and things like that.”"

For over 80 years, researchers at Harvard have studied what makes for a good life. They found one surefire, scientifically proven predictor of happiness: developing warmer relationships.
A team of reporters on The Times’s health and wellness desk, Well, developed a seven-day challenge to help you do just that. I spoke with Jancee Dunn, one of the reporters behind the program, about what she found when she tried it.
Lauren: When I see a “New Year’s challenge,” I immediately feel tired. What is different about this one?
Jancee: This isn’t a boot camp, and it isn’t a sugar challenge, both of which would be very hard for me to do. It’s a relationship challenge that will help you address and improve different parts of your social universe with seven science-backed exercises. More than that, it’s a way to think about your connections and what sustains you.
How did you get the idea for this?
Many of us on the Well desk had read “The Good Life” by Dr. Robert Waldinger, and we loved this book. It’s about the Harvard Study of Adult Development, which started during the Depression. For generations, researchers have followed families from different socioeconomic backgrounds, asking them incredibly detailed questions and giving them medical exams.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
And what did the study find?
What emerged is that a crucial element of happiness is relationships.
If you’re going to make one single decision that would ensure your own health and happiness, the science tells us that it should be to cultivate warm relationships of all kinds. It’s not just about having a partner. It’s in every realm of your life. So we worked with Dr. Waldinger to craft exercises to help people cultivate more happiness in their relationships.
One of the challenges is an invitation to write a “eulogy for the living,” or to tell someone why you’re grateful for them right now. Have you tried it?
I did this once with my fourth-grade teacher, Roseann Manley. She wrote on my report card, “Jancee is a very talented writer, and I think she’s going to be a famous writer someday.” And I’m not a famous writer, but I remember reading that and thinking, “Oh, she sees something in me.” And it changed the course of my life.
So I tracked Ms. Manley down, all these years later. And I told her how grateful I was. And we’ve now exchanged dozens and dozens of letters. She’s 91, widowed and doesn’t have kids. I call her every Christmas. She sends me letters with puppies and kittens on the stationery. She’s become my substitute grandmother. It’s been a wonderful thing.

Another challenge encourages talking to strangers. You’re a reporter — what are your tips for starting those conversations?
My standard line for people with babies and dogs is, “What’s it like to be ignored by everybody because your baby-slash-dog is so cute?” Hundred percent success rate.
Or, if someone looks like they could use a little support, you could say, “How’s your day been?” When you say, “How are you?” people feel compelled to say, “Fine,” and that’s the end of it. An open-ended question is good.
Asking these questions can feel uncomfortable, and you risk rejection. But it can have maximum reward for truly minimal effort. And what’s better than that?
Do you have advice for readers who might be interested in trying to make changes like these, but put off actually doing them?
Research shows that a lot of people think, “Oh, I’m going to be happy in the future when I get that job I want, when I get the money or when I retire and I have more time.” But the idea of a time surplus is a fallacy. You can do something small and actionable today.
Sign up for Well’s seven-day challenge here. You’ll receive a new email each day, beginning tomorrow, with a quiz to assess the state of your relationships.

2023-01-03,"Murder is as ubiquitous in “Three Pines,” the noirish Amazon series from the creators of “The Crown,” as the bone-chilling Canadian weather. But as the bodies pile up in a claustrophobic Quebec village, one discovery shakes the fictional community to its core: the graves of three dead Indigenous children, surreptitiously concealed in the basement of a former Victorian residential school.
The discovery by Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, the morally unimpeachable detective at the center of the show, is notable because the scene is absent from the Louise Penny books that inspired the series. The scene also stands out for another reason: It was written a year before Indigenous leaders reported that ground-penetrating radar in 2021 had uncovered what appeared to be the remains of hundreds of Indigenous children near a residential school in British Columbia, an announcement that convulsed Canada.
The creators of “Three Pines,” which debuted in early December, have chosen to take the beloved character of Gamache, who operates as Canada’s Hercule Poirot in solving all manner of mysteries in Penny’s 18 books, and set him to the task of reckoning with a shameful chapter in Canadian history.
From the 1880s through 1990, at least 150,000 Indigenous children were forcibly sent to residential schools, established by the government and run largely by the Roman Catholic Church, where they were forbidden to speak their languages and faced sexual and physical abuse.
Penny, the Canadian author who is also executive producer on the series, said that seeing art inadvertently imitate life in such a visceral and horrific way had shocked many of the show’s creators. “When the headlines hit, we were appalled by the discovery, and we realized that this was no longer fiction — it was an ‘Oh My God’ moment,” she recalled.

As Canada grapples with dark chapters from its colonial past, Indigenous cultural observers said the series shines a rare global spotlight on the mistreatment of Indigenous peoples there, a reality long underplayed, obfuscated or ignored in Canadian popular culture.
The show also arrives as Canada, a country that prides itself on cultural diversity, has been buffeted by debates over cultural appropriation and who has the right to depict minorities in film, television and theater. That question was called into sharp relief a few years ago when the director Robert Lepage drew criticism for failing to cast First Nations people from Canada in “Kanata,” a play chronicling their historic suffering.
As in the United States, where television series like “Rutherford Falls,” “Dark Winds,” and FX’s “Reservation Dogs” have explored Native American themes, Canada has been exploring long-buried Indigenous narratives. A psychological television drama, “Bones of Crows,” about a residential school survivor, is set to premiere next year on the CBC, the national broadcaster, and there have been musical productions, television series and films that grapple with Indigenous subjects.

But Jesse Wente, a writer who is the first Indigenous chairman of Canada Council for the Arts, the national arts funding body, said there has yet to be a mainstream Canadian show with an Indigenous cast and crew and a budget on the scale of “Three Pines.” He viewed the omission as a legacy of colonialism that still infects Canadian culture and ignores Indigenous voices in the country’s storytelling.
“We could’ve been making shows like ‘Three Pines’ in Canada for more than a generation but we just haven’t,” he said.
“Three Pines” turns cultural appropriation on its head, reimagining a white-majority Quebec region as a vessel of Indigenous suffering and subjugation but also empowerment. And it recasts several of Penny’s characters: Isabelle Lacoste is not a white Quebecois policewoman but rather a strong-minded Indigenous single mother, while Bea Mayer, who runs a meditation center, is depicted as a formidable motorcycle-riding Indigenous gallery owner, played with raw intensity by the Indigenous actress Tantoo Cardinal.
Also forming an integral part of the series is Gamache’s investigation into the disappearance and murder of a Mohawk girl, Blue Two-Rivers, which is falsely pinned on a young First Nations man in an elaborate police frame-up. The disappearance and murder of Indigenous girls and women is so endemic in Canada that it spawned a national inquiry.
Penny has a cult following, including ardent pilgrims who travel to Quebec to retrace Gamache’s steps; messing with the blueprint of the novels was not without risk. “‘Three Pines’ lacks the warmth and welcoming I wrap myself in,” bemoaned one disappointed reader on Penny’s Facebook page.  Others lamented that the humor and joy of the books is absent in an unrelentingly dark series.
And while many of the novels’ characters remain, among them the misanthropic poet with a swearing pet duck, Penny herself said she was disappointed that the village of Three Pines, “a central character in the books,” was a sideshow in the series. Nevertheless, she said story lines that involved First Nations people in Canada had imbued the novels with new meaning.

The Indigenous content was the brainchild of British screenwriter Emilia di Girolamo, the series’s head writer and executive producer. Di Girolamo said that her decision to reimagine Penny’s novels through a different lens had been solidified during a research trip to Quebec for the series in 2019, when she read headlines about murdered Indigenous girls.
She also drew inspiration from a plotline in one of Penny’s novels detailing a young Cree man who goes missing.
“Louise Penny’s books are all about the dark and the light, and the mistreatment of Indigenous people is the dark in Canada at the moment,” she said.
Di Girolamo said the creative team worked hard to avoid “white saviorism” and brought in the 44-year-old director Tracey Deer, who is Indigenous and created the acclaimed comedy-drama series “Mohawk Girls,” to direct episodes dealing with residential schools. It also hired several First Nations people in Canada for main roles and as consultants.

Tracey Deer, who directed episodes of “Three Pines” and is Indigenous, said that she strove to ensure that the series took care to accurately portray Indigenous people and their culture.

Deer said that the strong, three-dimensional Indigenous characters had drawn her to the project. “As a young girl, I never saw someone like me on the big or little screen,” she said. “All I ever saw were Indians with feathers living 400 years ago or portrayed as someone with a substance abuse problem who gets killed.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Nevertheless, she said avoiding “white saviorism” represented an extraordinary challenge since the series’s primary hero and moral center, Gamache, is a middle-aged white male, portrayed with searing vulnerability by the British actor Alfred Molina. To guard against old and familiar colonial conventions, she said she had sought to develop strong Indigenous characters who are not victims and retain the power to shape their own identities.
“In the books we have the great Gamache, and he is white and is the lead detective and has all the power,” she said. “The last thing I wanted was another show that fetishizes Indigenous suffering and left us in a place of victimhood.”
Deer said she had worked to depict Indigenous culture with authenticity. For example in one episode, after the remains of children are discovered, mourners are smudged with sage, to honor the dead. The original script featured a more Eurocentric candlelit vigil.
Nevertheless, aspects of the plot upset some Indigenous cast members, in particular a scene in which Blue Two-Rivers’s mother, despairing over the failure to find her daughter, hurls herself off the roof of a police station in Montreal.

Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers, a member of the Kainai First Nation in Alberta, who plays the police officer Isabelle Lacoste, lamented that there had been no Indigenous people in the series’s writing room, and she did not think the scene rang true. While suicide exists in some Indigenous communities, Tailfeathers said it didn’t seem realistic to present the mother as so desperate she would take her own life. She said she pleaded with the show’s producers to change that part of the script.

“When I see Indigenous women who have lost loved ones, they often fight back, and it wasn’t an accurate image of the women I know,” she explained.
Di Girolamo responded that the suicide scene underscored Gamache’s fallibility. “Gamache totally fails to save Blue,” she said. “It was a powerful moment to show what police are doing to Indigenous people and their failure to help.”
Tailfeathers said that she was initially conflicted about playing a police officer, since police in Canada have been criticized as being abusive and violent toward Indigenous people; in the past, for example, officers removed Indigenous children from their homes and delivered them to the residential schools.
But the opportunity to portray a powerful Indigenous role model swayed her. “I was drawn by Lacoste’s complexity, her tenacity and her strength,” she said.
Still, she said the series’s raw depiction of real life traumas had sometimes triggered her, since her own maternal grandparents had been sent to residential schools. To help the cast deal with grief or trauma, there was an Indigenous therapist on set.
Despite its unflinching portrayal of Canadian law enforcement, “Three Pines” has won praise from some Québécois police officers, who have commended its stark realism.

Marcel Savard, a former deputy chief and 40-year veteran of the Sûreté du Québec, Quebec’s provincial police force, for which Gamache works in the books, said he appreciated the inspector’s relentlessness and humanity.
“Gamache may run out of leads or hit a wall, but he never abandons the Indigenous victims,” he said. “He made me feel proud.”"

The vote for House speaker is the kind of government procedure that Americans often ignore, but yesterday’s highly unusual votes have important implications for the future of the Republican Party and how it will govern.
On their first day in the majority, House Republicans couldn’t agree on who will lead them. Representative Kevin McCarthy has sought for years to become speaker, but some members of his party’s far-right faction refused to back him. It was the first time in 100 years that the House failed to elect a speaker on the first ballot, and lawmakers adjourned after three ballots without making a choice. The Democratic House leader, Hakeem Jeffries, even received more votes than McCarthy in all three rounds of voting.
Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right lawmaker who has become a close ally of McCarthy’s, accused her fellow hard-liners of “playing Russian roulette with our hard-earned Republican majority.” Bill Huizenga, another McCarthy supporter, asked his colleagues, “You guys aren’t interested in governing?”
Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who had endorsed McCarthy, refused to say after the votes if he was sticking to his endorsement. (McCarthy later said that he had talked to Trump and still had his support.)
Part of McCarthy’s problem is that his party holds a narrow margin in the House, with 222 seats to Democrats’ 212. So he requires support from Republicans’ right-wing flank to reach the majority he needs to be speaker. But that is only part of the story.
Republicans also don’t agree on what the party is and what it should stand for: Should it continue down the path that Trump began when he won the Republican nomination for president in 2016? Or should the party moderate and embrace more compromise to consolidate power?

2023-01-05,"How can anyone feel less than optimistic about a year that starts with a veritable explosion of polka dots?
Ten years after its initial collaboration with the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, Louis Vuitton has once again teamed up with Ms. Kusama for the first big collection of the year, and it’s a doozy. Hundreds of pieces of LV merch (sneakers, slides, bags, bikinis, bucket hats, coats, skirts and pants for both men and women) speckled with multicolor dots, metallic dots and pretty much every other permutation of dot imaginable, like joyful confetti raining down on a sea of logos.
Unveiled on Jan. 1 in Asia, and Jan. 6 in the rest of the world, the line raises the bar for what is fast turning into a hackneyed fashion trope. (Running out of ideas? Do a collaboration!) It also serves as an overture of good cheer for a year that is otherwise cloaked in uncertainty.
Yes, we can be nervous about household spending and geopolitics and maybe even a Covid resurgence, but take a moment to window-shop past Ms. Kusama’s spotty reimagining of the LV world and you’ll find it impossible not to smile. Even better, this is simply drop one of two. The next batch of goodies featuring more of Ms. Kusama’s signature work is coming at the end of March — a reminder that there are plenty of interesting, distracting and possibly even thrilling fashion developments that will shape our self-expression, and wardrobes, in 2023.

The Gucci vibe shift (and other appointments and debuts)

Style-setters of the world were shocked when Alessandro Michele, the designer who transformed Gucci from a gold-plated, python-skinned avatar of hard-core aspiration into a big-tent hodgepodge of emotion, product and identity, announced in November that he was stepping down. His departure leaves an enormous void at a luxury megabrand, not to mention pop culture in general, and it raises the question of what happens next: more of the same or a dramatic about-face? Whoever lands at the top will be responsible in part for resetting the mood of the industry.
Speaking of highly influential new jobs: Over a year after the death of Virgil Abloh, Louis Vuitton has yet to name a new men’s wear designer, but word is that an appointment will happen soon. Though whether a LV or Gucci announcement will take place before the upcoming season’s big debut — Daniel Lee at Burberry — remains to be seen. Mr. Lee is the highly celebrated designer of Bottega Veneta who left that brand under a cloud in late 2021. Whether he can effect the same turnaround for Britain’s biggest luxury house, and his own reputation, will be the test of London Fashion Week in February.
Phoebe Philo most likely, definitely, probably, finally returns

When Phoebe Philo, a.k.a., the Greta Garbo of fashion, revealed in July 2021 that she would be returning to fashion with her own brand under her own name, there was a clutching of breasts and shrieking with joy by an adult female population that had been trying to figure out what to wear ever since Ms. Philo left her position as creative director at Céline about five years ago.
After all, it was at Céline that Ms. Philo had become the patron saint of smart, grown-up women everywhere, with her embrace of quietly complicated luxury minimalism. Now she was coming back, and on her own terms! Joy! Rapture! More information was promised last January, but that month, and the entire year, came and went with no news from the Philo camp. The smart money says that the Phoebe Philo brand will finally make its debut in 2023. Expectations are higher than Lady Gaga’s platform stilettos.

It is impossible to ignore the fact that movies and streamers have become not only mega-watching events, but mega-fashion events, and that costume designers are often as influential as any fashion designer. To that end, two premieres are almost guaranteed to filter into closets everywhere.
First up is “Daisy Jones & the Six,” the Amazon Prime series based on Taylor Jenkins Reid’s book that is scheduled for release on March 3, smack in the middle of Paris Fashion Week. The show stars Riley Keough as the Stevie Nicks-like main character, as well as assorted rock ‘n’ roll, flower power 1970s designs courtesy of Denise Wingate, the costume designer, which are pretty much guaranteed to shape festival fashion for the rest of the year. Then in July comes the movie event that has been seeping into collections since the first screenshots leaked last year: Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” with costume design by Jacqueline Durran. Expect a summer of neon pink and yellow, with the related postmodern revisionism of the classic fashion palette.

On May 6, King Charles III will be officially crowned, as will Queen Consort Camilla, and while the event will purportedly be less grand than the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II back in 1953, it will nonetheless provide a moment to reset the royal agenda after the Prince Harry and Meghan revelations (which will continue this month with the publication of Harry’s memoir). Get ready for at least a dollop of pomp and circumstance, as well as some serious bling and historic image-making by the immediate royal family, including William, the Prince of Wales; his wife, Catherine, and their three always coordinated children. Given that Prince Harry and Meghan will reportedly also be invited, the style stakes will be even greater.
That the fairy-tale ceremony comes only a few days after the Met Gala, this year held in honor of Karl Lagerfeld and offering a take on fashion royalty of a different kind, will make it a dressing week to remember.

Fashion tends to have a horror of airing its squabbles in court, but two potentially significant cases will take place early this year in the Southern District of New York for all to hear. On Jan. 3, opening arguments in the Adidas v. Thom Browne trademark infringement and unfair competition suit took place, as Adidas goes after the Zegna-owned fashion brand (whose founder is also the new head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America) over whether its use of four and five stripes on its sportswear is too close to the Adidas three-stripe logo. Given the increasing synergies between the worlds of high fashion and sports, the case, which will continue through the next week or two, could have some major wardrobe repercussions.
Then at the end of the month (assuming the parties don’t reach a settlement between now and then) comes Hermès v. Rothschild, Mason Rothschild being the artist who created the MetaBirkin NFT series — that group of digital representations of fuzzy, colorful Birkin-alikes that was also a comment on consumer culture — with all its potential implications for what happens when questions of fashion, creativity, artistic expression and the metaverse collide. Your avatar, or the potential wardrobe for your avatar, not to mention the relationship between fashion and that nebulous collecting arena otherwise known as nonfungible tokens, may never be the same."
2023-01-06,"The U.S. economy produced jobs at a slower but still comfortable rate at the end of 2022, as higher interest rates and changing consumer habits downshifted the labor market without bringing it to a halt.
Employers added 223,000 jobs in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department reported on Friday, in line with economists’ expectations although the smallest gain since President Biden took office.
The gradual cooling indicates that the economy may be coming back into balance after years of pandemic-era disruptions — so far with limited pain for workers. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5 percent, back to its level from early 2020, which matched a low last seen in 1969.
“If the U.S. economy is slipping into recession, nobody told the labor market,” said Chris Varvares, co-head of U.S. economics for S&P Global Market Intelligence, noting that the December number is still nearly double the approximately 100,000 jobs needed to keep up with population growth.

Stocks jumped on the news. The S&P 500 gained 2.3 percent, reflecting expectations that a slowdown in job growth and wage gains could reduce the pressure on prices and make the Federal Reserve less aggressive in raising interest rates.
The report brought job creation for the year to 4.5 million, pending revisions, as the economy continued to recover from its plunge in 2020. Still, total employment is still millions short of where it was headed before the pandemic, with job losses predicted in the year ahead.
The Biden administration trumpeted the report, calling it evidence that its economic agenda has been working. “For the last two months, we’ve seen good job growth, we’ve seen wage rates go up, and we’ve seen inflation pressures come down,” Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh said in an interview. “I think it’s a slow and steady approach to bring down inflation and not worry about going into a recession.”
Avoiding a recession, of course, is far from guaranteed. That will depend on the Fed’s ability to edge interest rates just high enough to contain inflation but not so much that the economy enters a downward spiral — a balancing act that the Fed itself isn’t sure is possible.

The slowdown in hiring in recent months is a sign that the Fed’s strategy may finally be constraining the labor market, which remained a standout even as some drivers of economic activity started to sputter. Wage growth eased to 4.6 percent over a year ago, as the frenzy of people reshuffling into new jobs — and demanding better pay — has faded.

So far, layoffs and initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained extremely low, while the gap between the number of available workers and listed jobs is far larger than its historical average.
Nonetheless, the Fed forecasts that the extremely low unemployment rate will rise to about 4.6 percent by the end of this year, as its interest rate increases force companies to retrench. For the Fed’s prediction to come true, employers would have to shed well over a million jobs in 2023.
“We’re not expecting to see job losses right now, but how do you get to one million jobs fewer over the next year?” asks Christine Cooper, chief U.S. economist at the real estate data firm CoStar. “We’re going to have to see some negative numbers.”

December’s gains were driven by strong hiring in leisure and hospitality, which added 67,000 jobs, and health care, with 55,000. State government employment would have been significantly higher if not for a strike by 48,000 workers at the University of California. Even sectors that had been wobbling, such as retail, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, eked out small increases.
But certain hard-hit industries like hotels and restaurants still haven’t regained their prior strength, and have struggled to attract — and keep — enough workers to satisfy surging consumer demand. Others that had explosive growth while catering to Covid-era lifestyles are fading fast.

Interest rate increases have directly affected the labor market by taking the air out of the tech sector; the information services category dropped 5,000 jobs in December. That doesn’t include the bulk of 18,000 recently announced layoffs at Amazon, or the 8,000 at Salesforce.
Rising borrowing costs have also hamstrung home sales, resulting in sharp cuts at mortgage brokerages. But in an example of how backlogged demand is still powering even industries sensitive to interest rates, construction employers have continued to add jobs at a solid pace.

That could change soon, as order books stabilize. Erica Goodnight runs a lumber supplier in Harmony, N.C., that serves people building backyard sheds, barns and other outbuildings. The company did brisk business as homeowners added more space during the pandemic, but this year Ms. Goodnight is sitting tight on hiring.
“We’ve found a sweet spot,” Ms. Goodnight said. “I don’t necessarily foresee any openings. And honestly I think a lot of companies, if the employee will stay and show up for work, they’re not removing positions, because they got burned when they laid off employees in the beginning stages of Covid, and those folks didn’t come back.”
That steady easing is also evident in the number of hours the average worker puts in each week, a figure that has been falling for months and is now on the lower end of its prepandemic range.
Fed officials watch wage increases closely, concerned that they will continue to propel inflation as spending shifts from goods to services, where salaries largely drive prices. The cooler number in December may provide some reassurance that they can continue the path of stepping down interest rate increases that the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, communicated last month as inflation also subsided.
“That sort of orderly progression suggests that the economy is moving in ways that we will start to see that imbalance disappear,” Raphael Bostic, a Fed governor, said at a conference of economists in New Orleans on Friday, while cautioning that he expected rates to remain high throughout 2023.

Over the past year, the darkest shadow over the labor market has been the glacial recovery in the share of people either working or looking for work, which remains about a percentage point lower than its level in February 2020. The rebound may be speeding up, as household savings accumulated during the pandemic have dwindled and fast inflation has pushed Americans to take on extra work.
Marshall Chandler would like to stop working, at 69, but his shrunken 401(k) account won’t let him. For the past three years, he has been selling high-end Swiss watches at Breguet on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where he says his age is more of an asset than a handicap.
“I would not object to being retired now, but it’s just not realistic for me,” Mr. Chandler said. “If the market restrengthens and my health continues to be good, I hope to be able to retire in four to five years.”

That’s something Rebecca Rogers Tijerino, the president of Spherion Staffing and Recruiting, has noticed. More applicants have come through her company’s doors over the past quarter, allowing her to fill open listings more quickly.
Along with rising costs, headlines about a looming recession can also drive people to look for more solid positions. “We’ve seen people proactively concerned about the ‘R’ word,” Ms. Tijerino said. “If they’re not on firm ground with their current employer, they’re looking to make a change.”
The number of people employed by temporary help services — which historically dips as employers try to shed labor while keeping their permanent employees in an uncertain economic environment — dropped by 35,000, and is down 111,000 jobs since July.
Workers are not the only ones worried about a recession. Measures of corporate sentiment, like a recent survey of chief financial officers by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, are at a low ebb, boding ill for employment gains in the coming year. The Institute for Supply Management found that manufacturing contracted for the second straight month in December, indicating that more companies see business worsening rather than getting better.
That’s why experts, while encouraged by the latest numbers, caution against declaring a premature happy ending to the pandemic recovery story.
“We’re reading that book, and it’s getting really good, but we’re not done,” said Kathryn Edwards, an adjunct economist at the RAND Corporation. “I would hate for the interpretation of this jobs report to be, ‘We did it.’”

A case of sticker shock in the poultry aisle of a downtown Toronto grocery store owned by Loblaw Companies, Canada’s largest food retailer, caused a backlash on social media about what, and perhaps who, is behind the rise in food prices.

Accusations of profiteering were directed toward the grocer and its chief executive and chairman, Galen Weston Jr., in an overwhelming number of comments responding to a Twitter post by Siobhan Morris, a Toronto broadcast reporter who shared her picture of a pack of five chicken breasts. The price: 37 Canadian dollars.
The company later clarified that those chicken breasts were part of its more expensive premium-quality line, but the explanation had little effect on the outrage, underscoring how food retailers have become a lightning rod for Canadian discontent.

“We love to hate our grocers,” said Mike von Massow, a food economy professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario. “We particularly love to hate Galen Weston, and I think that’s part of the cost of being the biggest grocer, and it’s also part of the cost of being in your own ads.”
(Mr. Weston is a familiar face to many Canadians, regularly appearing in commercials for the company, founded by his great-grandfather, and its many brands.)
“While it’s easy to get angry at the grocer, there’s very little evidence that the grocers are actually taking advantage of the situation,” Professor von Massow told me.
In one example, a pricing dispute between Loblaw and PepsiCo Inc. led to the temporary disappearance of some Frito-Lay Canada chips and snack products from grocery shelves after the supplier requested higher costs and Loblaw pushed back.
A similar combination of factors affecting food prices globally, including the war in Ukraine, labor shortages, gas prices and supply chain pressures exacerbated by pandemic disruptions, has played into Canada’s food inflation as well. Local extreme weather conditions also contributed, as seen during the Western Canadian drought in 2021 that decimated wheat crops and pushed desperate Manitoba farmers to save their cattle herds.

Grocery profits are up, but a recent study from Dalhousie University in Halifax showed profit margins over the last four years have remained consistent.
“The fact that margins haven’t changed means that we probably haven’t seen prices stretched above the cost increases,” Professor von Massow told me.
Some of the wrath and mistrust toward Loblaw could stem from the company’s admission in 2017 to playing a role in Canada’s bread price-fixing scandal that lasted more than a decade. Adding to that, the company recently announced a temporary price freeze on its popular in-house line of No Name products, which was dismissed by consumer advocates as a gimmick.

An investigation by the Competition Bureau, a government agency, is ongoing. In an effort to make recommendations to the government that would improve grocery store competition, the agency announced in October that it was starting a new study on the sector, while making clear the work was “not an investigation into specific allegations of wrongdoing.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The study will conclude in June, but Professor von Massow said he was not optimistic that the findings would have a real effect on food inflation, citing the study’s short timeline and the missed opportunity to investigate how grocers wield their market power over suppliers.
“If governments want to make a difference, rather than pointing fingers at grocers, they should find ways to ease the pressure for those people who are making explicit decisions between eating and paying rent,” Professor von Massow told me.
Food prices have risen at a higher rate than consumer inflation since late 2021, according to a recent report by Statistics Canada, the national census agency. The 11.4 percent yearly price increase recorded in September food costs represents the fastest growth Canada has seen since 1981, and that increase held into November.
In Europe, the price of food climbed to 13.6 percent over the year through November in 19 countries that use the euro as their currency, outpacing Canada’s increases.

Researchers at four Canadian universities predict that food prices here will rise in 2023 by 5 to 7 percent overall, with more notable price increases among vegetables, dairy products and meat products.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
These forecasts, published in Canada’s annual Food Price Report, translate to a predicted yearly food bill of more than 16,000 Canadian dollars, an increase of $1,065 in grocery expenses for an average family of four, compared with 2022. Last year, actual food inflation was higher than the report’s predictions.
“We’re experiencing what, for us, are really high food prices and that creates a lot of difficulty, but we’re spending a lower percentage of take-home income on food than many other jurisdictions,” said Stuart Smyth, an associate professor in the department of agricultural and resource economics at the University of Saskatchewan and a co-author of the report.
Professor Smyth doesn’t expect prices to ease for at least the first half of this year, particularly with the slated increase in the federal carbon tax in April, which is likely to raise the cost of running farm equipment and transporting food.
“If there’s a silver lining at all, in any of the discussions and conversations about the increase in food prices, it’s that there are worse places to be,” he said.

China reopens
Families across the world are preparing for reunions after China fully opened its borders yesterday and began welcoming visitors without strict quarantine requirements.
The reopening comes at an auspicious time for global tourism. China is also allowing its citizens to once again go overseas, just as the travel period for Lunar New Year begins.
But unease has tempered the celebratory mood. Some countries fear that China’s outbreak could lead to new mutations of the virus and added additional restrictions for incoming travelers. And within China, there are fears that rural villages, which have a disproportionate number of older adults and scant access to medical care, are particularly at risk as domestic travel increases.
Here are more specific restrictions:
The E.U. “strongly encouraged” its 27 members to put in place testing and masking requirements as Chinese return to popular cities there.
Hong Kong capped the daily number of visitors at 60,000 people. It will require visitors to show a negative P.C.R. test.
South Korea halted all direct flights to Jeju Island, once favored by Chinese tourists. Travelers have to take a P.C.R. test when they arrive in Seoul and quarantine if they are found to be sick.
Japan is requiring visitors to provide proof of a negative P.C.R. test before arriving and to take another test when they arrive.
Thailand is anticipating around 300,000 Chinese visitors in the first three months of 2023. But it will still require visitors to have two vaccine shots. They will also need to have medical insurance to cover Covid treatment if they get sick.

Rioters storm the Brazilian capital
Thousands of supporters of Brazil’s right-wing former president, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed the country’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices in Brasília, the capital, yesterday to protest what they falsely claim was a stolen election. After more than five hours, the authorities said that the military police had retaken control of the site.
The assault was the violent culmination of incessant rhetorical attacks on the nation’s electoral systems by Bolsonaro, who lost a close runoff to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, in October. Lula, who was in São Paulo when the protests erupted, signed an emergency decree allowing the federal government to take additional measures to restore order.
Brazil’s justice minister said that about 200 people had been arrested. Local officials said that the authorities were investigating reports of rioters attacking journalists, smashing windows of ministry buildings and carrying bladed weapons.
Bolsonaro: The former leader has been staying in Florida, where he traveled late last month as his presidency was coming to a close. Since his election loss, his supporters have been camped outside military bases across the country and had called on the armed forces to take control of the government and halt Lula’s recent inauguration.

McDonald’s ex-C.E.O. pays for his firing scandal
Three years after being fired as McDonald’s C.E.O. over what was eventually revealed as several inappropriate personal relationships with employees, Steve Easterbrook on Monday agreed to punishments from the S.E.C. over how his termination played out.
The agency’s accusations are a major milestone in a scandal that gripped corporate America, as the fast-food giant accused its former chief of misleading internal investigators. But they’re also the latest sign of how the S.E.C. is seeking to hold companies to account for what they do — and don’t — reveal to investors.
The S.E.C.’s case revolved around disclosure. The regulator said Easterbrook misled investors about the reasons for his termination. McDonald’s initially said he was terminated “without cause” for having what he said was a consensual relationship with an employee, and allowed him to leave with a separation package worth about $40 million. The company, however, later uncovered other relationships that Easterbrook hadn’t disclosed and sued him.
“By allegedly concealing the extent of his misconduct during the company’s internal investigation, Easterbrook broke that trust with — and ultimately misled — shareholders,” Gurbir Grewal, the director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, said in a statement.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Easterbrook will be barred from serving as a public company executive or director for five years, and will also pay a $400,000 fine. McDonald’s didn’t pay a penalty because it cooperated with the S.E.C. For its part, the company noted that it had already taken action against Easterbrook, including firing him and clawing back compensation.
The S.E.C.’s move drew criticism from within. The regulator’s two Republican commissioners said the agency appeared to question expanding its regulatory powers through enforcement. “The order casts McDonald’s, the victim of Mr. Easterbrook’s deception, as a securities law violator through a novel interpretation of the Commission’s expansive executive compensation disclosure requirements,” they said.
It’s the latest instance of criticism facing federal regulators over whether they’re overstepping their bounds by effectively writing new rules.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Microsoft reportedly weighs a $10 billion investment in the parent of ChatGPT. The tech giant is in talks to pour more money into OpenAI, along with other venture investors, according to Semafor. Microsoft had previously invested in OpenAI and is said to be planning to incorporate ChatGPT into products like its Bing search engine.
House Republicans eke out another legislative win. They narrowly approved an overhaul of the House’s operating rules, overcoming concerns by moderates about concessions made to the hard right to help Speaker Kevin McCarthy clinch his job. Republicans also voted to cut funding for the I.R.S., but the move is unlikely to pass the Senate.
Disney requires employees to work in the office four days a week. The edict by Bob Iger, the company’s newly returned C.E.O., is a relatively strict return-to-office policy compared with most in corporate America. It’s among the many big overhauls that Iger is likely to make at Disney, which may also include layoffs.
Another Sam Bankman-Fried associate reportedly meets with prosecutors. Nishad Singh, who previously led engineering at FTX, has held talks over a potential cooperation agreement with the Justice Department, according to Bloomberg. If he secures a deal, he would join Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang in working against Bankman-Fried.

Growing opposition to the F.T.C.’s noncompete move
The F.T.C.’s proposal to ban noncompete agreements is among the agency’s most sweeping moves in recent years, and it would have far-reaching consequences if it takes effect. But the move has also given business lobbyists an opportunity: a chance to challenge the agency’s power in court.
“We’ve been preparing for this moment, whether it was this issue or another,” Sean Heather, a senior vice president of international regulatory affairs and antitrust at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told DealBook. “It has nothing to do with the subject matter, but we don’t think they have the authority.”

A big question is whether Congress gave the F.T.C. this authority. Some skeptics — including Noah Phillips, a Republican former commissioner at the regulator — argue that lawmakers didn’t give the agency the power to write new rules.
But antitrust experts note that a 1973 federal court decision — National Petroleum Refiners Association v. F.T.C. — did grant rule-making power. That legal decision allowed it to require businesses to post octane ratings on gas pumps. The rule, still in place today, was able to stand because it addressed a public harm, and Congress didn’t explicitly limit the F.T.C.’s rule-making power.

But a lot has changed since then. Antitrust experts across the political spectrum say courts now don’t tend to find agency authority where it’s not explicitly granted. Last June, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority ruled in West Virginia v. E.P.A. that the environmental agency overstepped its authority by creating emissions regulations that touch on “major questions” with big economic consequences.
That “major questions doctrine” had once been considered a fringe conservative legal position. Now, however, it’s become a key part of litigation strategy for industrial groups looking to fight new regulatory rules.

Even supporters of the F.T.C.’s move are wary. The regulator will most likely modify its proposal based on public comments made over a 60-day period, so no final rule will be issued for some time. Even then, whatever the agency does must still pass legal muster.
“That might be an uphill battle, given the way judges — particularly conservative judges — think,” Jon Leibowitz, a Democratic former F.T.C. chair, told DealBook. “It’s not a Hail Mary, but it’s definitely a shot down the field.”
Bed Bath and debts
Moments ago, Bed Bath & Beyond reported earnings, and there’s one question on nearly everyone’s mind: Can the retailer avoid bankruptcy after raising its own doubts about its financial health?
The company is looking for new capital, and its share price surged Monday on investor speculation that it could be an acquisition target. Given all of that, it’s worth analyzing how the home goods retailer got into this position.

Bed Bath & Beyond isn’t a typical retailer debt story. Most recent retail bankruptcies came after a boom in private equity deals in the sector over the previous decade. The acquisitions of companies like Toys “R” Us, the shoe chain Payless and the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus saddled them with debt, on the assumption that they could rely on steady cash flow to kick-start growth. But those mountains of debt became a noose that left those retailers unable to compete against the rise of Amazon.
But Bed Bath & Beyond started taking on significant debt in 2014, selling $1.5 billion in bonds to buy back stock, which one analyst described at the time as a “seminal event.”. (It was still far less than what would be attached to a typical leveraged buyout, however.) Thanks to cheap credit and the company’s status as a retail giant, it got a good deal on that debt: Those bonds had maturation dates of 10, 20 and 30 years with interest rates of 3.8 percent, 4.9 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, according to James Gellert, the C.E.O. of the financial analytics firm RapidRatings.
Those were terms Bed Bath & Beyond could “only dream of” at any other time, Gellert told DealBook.

Rising competition and disappointing sales have hammered the company. While the retailer once stood strongly on its own after its competitor Linens ’n Things collapsed, management struggled to figure out the right strategy to compete with Kohl’s, Amazon and Target. Its supply chain management was hit hard by a shopping shift brought on by the pandemic. As a result, delivery times got extended, and costs increased. As its earnings disappeared, cash went to plugging its losses and its leverage skyrocketed. Bed Bath & Beyond’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization jumped to 6.19 in 2020 from 1.95 in 2019. “Ultimately, if you look at the debt level,” said Christina Boni, a senior vice president of Corporate Finance at Moody’s. “It’s more a function of the decline in profitability, more than anything else.”
Taking on more leverage hasn’t solved the problem. Bed Bath & Beyond tapped the debt market again in August, giving it a lifeline, and the hope that vendors would have enough confidence in the company to keep its shelves stocked during the holiday season. But it’s still struggled in recent months to procure the products customers wanted, and to sell enough of what it had.
The retailer, whose stock market capitalization has dropped to $190 million from a peak of $17 billion in 2013, could skip debt payments on Feb. 1. “Multiple paths are being explored, and we are determining our next steps thoroughly, and in a timely manner,” Susan Gove, the C.E.O. who launched a turnaround plan just months ago, said this morning.

Europe is suddenly a hot place to invest
A cost-of-living crisis, recession fears and a war raging on its eastern border: At first glance, Europe would hardly seem to be a go-to region for investors. But Wall Street increasingly sees an opportunity — particularly when compared with the U.S.
The latest economic data point to a shallow downturn. Investors got another spurt of upbeat news on Monday, with eurozone unemployment hitting a record low and factory output rising in Germany, the engine of the bloc’s economy.
Analysts are taking note. Last week, Citigroup raised its rating on European equities to overweight, saying valuations were relatively cheap. At the same time, they cut their 2023 outlook on U.S. stocks to underweight for the opposite reason: American shares are still too expensive.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Investors got the message months ago. European stocks have been outperforming American equities for several months. The benchmark Pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 10 percent last quarter and Germany’s DAX gained nearly 15 percent. At the same time, the S&P 500 climbed 7.5 percent.
Companies on both sides of the Atlantic are facing similar headwinds. Inflation remains at a multi-decade high, central banks are raising interest rates, recession seems likely, and that will probably torpedo corporate profits. Goldman Sachs predicts earnings per share for S&P 500 companies will flatline this year and Liberum Capital forecasts a volley of downgrades.
Europe may be over the worst and that’s enough for investors. This week, Goldman Sachs upgraded its forecast on eurozone G.D.P. to show meager growth for 2023, or a year-on-year gain of 0.6 percent versus an earlier prediction of a 0.1 percent slide. One big reason: energy prices have been falling across the bloc, with natural gas futures hitting a 12-month low as warmer winter temperatures have cooled off demand.
That’s lifting the sentiment of consumers and businesses. “After a modest winter recession, the eurozone economy will stabilize in spring and start to recover at an above-consensus pace thereafter,” Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg, wrote in a recent note to clients.

2023-01-11,"A federal labor official on Wednesday rejected Amazon’s attempt to overturn a union victory at a warehouse on Staten Island, removing a key obstacle to contract negotiations between the union and the company.
The official, a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board, found that there was a lack of evidence to support Amazon’s claim of election improprieties and that its objections to the election should be overruled.
“Amazon’s workers won fair and square,” Chris Smalls, the president of the Amazon Labor Union, said in a statement. “It’s now time for Amazon to quit stalling, obey the law, respect their workers, and sit down at the bargaining table.”
The decision was widely expected after a labor board hearing officer recommended in September that the company’s objections be set aside. Amazon, which argued that the election was unfair because of improper conduct by both the labor board and the union, said in a statement that it knew the regional director was unlikely to rule against the agency.

The company said it intended to appeal the decision to the labor board in Washington. “As we’ve said since the beginning, we don’t believe this election process was fair, legitimate or representative of the majority of what our team wants,” the statement said.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
In an interview at The New York Times DealBook conference in late November, Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, indicated that the company would not drop its challenges, calling the fight “far from over.”

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
“That has a real chance to end up in federal courts,” Mr. Jassy said.
The N.L.R.B. regional director found that the evidence Amazon presented either did not establish that the board or the union acted improperly or that it did not show that their actions altered the outcome of the election.
For example, Amazon had accused the labor board of failing to control the presence of members of the news media near the voting area. But the regional director found that “the press was peaceably assembled and not engaged in harassment of voters” and that board officials “had no responsibility to instruct the press not to talk to voters or to leave the employer’s property.”
Workers at the warehouse, known as JFK8, voted to join the independent Amazon Labor Union in an election whose results were announced in April. More than 8,000 employees were eligible to take part, and the union won by roughly 10 percentage points.

Weeks later, the union lost a vote to represent workers at a smaller Amazon warehouse on Staten Island, LDJ5, and it lost another vote at a warehouse near Albany, N.Y., in October.
The decision on Wednesday came after another unfavorable ruling for Amazon tied to activity at JFK8. In mid-November, a federal judge in New York issued an injunction requiring the company to “cease and desist” from firing workers for exercising their labor rights. The judge also forced company officials to read her order to workers at the warehouse.
The case that resulted in the federal judge’s injunction dates back to the early days of the pandemic, when an Amazon worker protested safety conditions outside JFK8 and was later fired.
The judge’s ruling essentially put Amazon on notice that it could not fire workers for engaging in protected activities like protesting safety conditions or union organizing. Amazon officials read the judge’s order to workers at JFK8 repeatedly during the first week of December."
2023-01-12,"A director’s career is often measured by the quality and quantity of their feature films. But short films can offer a chance to experiment with styles and subjects that might not be suited for a wider commercial release. “The Seven Faces of Jane” combines these two modes of production to create an omnibus film; it’s a feature-length movie comprising short films made by emerging directors.
At the center of each short story is Jane (played by Gillian Jacobs, who also directs the first of the movie’s shorts), a single mother who opens the movie by dropping off her daughter at summer camp in Malibu. The film’s episodic story follows Jane as she floats through a series of encounters during her week of solitude in Southern California. She begins with a surreal trip to a roadside diner, but her journeys take her to the desert, the beach and the mountains. She connects with strangers, as well as lovers, including a former flame played by Joel McHale, who starred on the TV series “Community” with Jacobs.
Jane is a bit of a blank slate as a protagonist, and her flatness feels jarring when she encounters other characters with more depth. One episode introduces Tayo (Chido Nwokocha), an ex of Jane’s who describes feeling alienated from his Blackness and sense of self during their relationship. Another sequence finds Jane teaching the steps of a waltz to a teenager dreading the dances at her quinceañera. Jane acts as a sounding board when these characters describe their feelings about their specific cultures. Yet in her responses, she remains as two-dimensional as a sketch on white paper.

The directors — Jacobs, Gia Coppola, Boma Iluma, Ryan Heffington, Xan Cassavetes, Julian J. Acosta, Ken Jeong (another of Jacobs’s “Community” castmates) and Alex Takacs — come from a wide range of creative and personal backgrounds. But the shorts blend together without significant variation. The transitions eschew title cards, subtly eliding shifts by returning to images of Jane in her car.
There is continuity in this makeshift road picture‌ — Jane’s costumes and makeup remain cohesive across the shorts, and the film’s segments keep the same cool color palette. But the consistency limits the ability of the directors to lean into their own style, leading to a movie that feels narratively scattered and stylistically inhibited.

2023-01-13,"There are many ways to make yourself Twitter’s main character for a day, but faking your death might be the most reliable. As remote-work types struggled to awake from their holiday season hibernation last week, we were jolted by a particularly juicy tidbit: Susan Meachen, a prolific self-published romance novelist whose suicide — ostensibly a reaction to low book sales and bullying by fellow authors — had been announced two years ago, returned to the internet, very much alive. “Let the fun begin,” she concluded a social media post announcing her resurrection.
The fun did begin, though on a much larger scale than she likely expected. She had announced her return to the 700 or so fans and fellow writers who still followed her Facebook page, but the news spread fast. Within a day, millions more had read about her; BookTok was overtaken with videos of creators recapping the events or setting their disbelief to song. Suddenly, scores of people who, like me, didn’t know the difference between an H.E.A. and an H.F.N. ending — “happily ever after” versus “happy for now” — were immersing themselves in the internal drama of a tiny group of indie romance writers.
Few topics are less funny than suicide, and Ms. Meachen caused genuine pain to people who cared about her. There’s also a question of actual fraud, since her “relatives” allegedly crowdsourced money for her “funeral.” But the deeper reporters and amateur sleuths dived down the rabbit hole, the more bizarre — and, yes, amusing — the details. She appears to have created a fake account to resume running her Facebook group, The Ward, after her purported death. She or a relative convinced other writers to edit her “last” book for free in time to present it as a posthumous wedding present to Ms. Meachen’s daughter.

Her novels, with their stock cover images and generic titles like “Stolen Moments” and “My Crush,” are filled with “dark secrets” and untimely deaths. On multiple occasions over the two years Ms. Meachen was believed to be dead, her “daughter” or “assistant” threatened to remove her books from Amazon because not enough people were buying them. One post from Ms. Meachen’s Facebook account, written from the perspective of her daughter, included the sentence “Dead people don’t post on social media.” If none of this makes you giggle, you’re a stronger person than I am.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The story seemed to strike a particular chord with those in and around the more established — and more prestigious — corners of the publishing industry. “While Meachen and the other writers who befriended her virtually refer to their community as ‘the book world,’ what they’re talking about has little to do,” wrote the book critic Laura Miller in Slate, a trace of condescension creeping in, with “the mainstream publishing industry, the professionals who work in it, and the authors whose books fill your local bookstore.” Rather, she said, “Meachen’s ‘book world’ is the community of self-published romance and erotica writers who sell low-cost e-books and print-on-demand paperbacks.”
All the talk of the book world — and how Ms. Meachen’s death had, as a former friend said, ripped it “in half” — did seem a bit overblown. But it also doesn’t seem quite accurate to argue that the rarefied realm of Manhattan-based Big Five publishers is any more “real” than the comparatively lowbrow one of self-published romances.
The vast majority of books are self-published. For Ms. Meachen, the choice to go that route may not have been much of a choice at all: Her creative use of capitalization and punctuation would have made her an unlikely prospect for Knopf. But there are plenty of very talented Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American, queer, disabled or trans authors who have looked at the industry’s long record of discrimination and concluded that self publishing was the only outlet open to them. Colleen Hoover, currently the most popular author in the world by a massive margin, attracted publishing houses’ attention only after her self-published novels became best-sellers. And the “legitimate” book world has had plenty of its own dumb drama in the past few years, from a 2019 Naomi Wolf book that was yanked from shelves because a central element of the historical research was wrong to a 2021 scandal in which a memoirist called people out for rating her book a mere four out of five stars on Goodreads and then compared the resulting outrage to “rape culture.”
For people in mainstream book publishing, the Meachen saga may also have provided a welcome distraction from their own problems. After a healthy bump in sales during the pandemic, disappointing 2022 numbers combined with a looming recession have led to hiring slowdowns and layoffs. The Justice Department and a federal judge blocked Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster on antitrust grounds, so now Simon & Schuster may well be acquired by a private equity firm, which rarely bodes well for creative-class companies. At HarperCollins — where I am under contract for my first book — about 250 New York-based unionized employees have been on strike for two months. The core issue is that the union wants to raise entry-level salaries by $5,000, to $50,000. The increase would cost HarperCollins, whose annual revenue is over $2 billion, less than $1 million a year; editors have told heart-wrenching stories about being unable to afford rent and food, taking on second jobs, leaving the industry altogether because, in one of the world’s most expensive cities, $45,000 is not enough to live on.
Yet the union says the company’s senior leaders have informed members that they will not return to the bargaining table. In the meantime, HarperCollins has begun hiring scab workers. The publishing industry’s work force remains far, far whiter than it should be, which has obvious ramifications for what books we get to read, yet executives seem to have no interest in making the industry more accessible to brilliant young minds who don’t come from generational wealth.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
On the surface, a HarperCollins editor striking in front of a Financial District skyscraper might seem to operate on another planet from a hobbyist writer posting from the grave begging people to kick in a couple of bucks for a romance novel. But what haunts me about the Meachen story is the kernel of universality behind her desperation for book world legitimacy. What author, self-published or traditional, can’t relate to indulging in a little self-pity when her sales aren’t where she hoped? What industry hasn’t seen bullying allegations and its share of unstable characters? Who in the book world writ large doesn’t feel she’s fighting for crumbs? As in any good romance novel, the drama in the Meachen scandal was dialed up far past the point of relatability, but the feelings behind the drama were familiar to us all.

2023-01-14,"MASTERS OF THE LOST LAND: The Untold Story of the Amazon and the Violent Fight for the World’s Last Frontier, by Heriberto Araujo
In 1970, the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil launched one of the world’s most ambitious construction projects: the Trans Amazonian Highway, a 2,600-mile road across the Amazon River basin. It was “a necessary effort,” President Emílio Garrastazu Médici declared at the time, “to solve two problems: one of people without land … and another of land without people.”
Over the next decades, hundreds of thousands of migrants traveled along that highway and other new roads in search of cheap land — often finding themselves thrust into violent conflict with timber barons, cattle ranchers and other oligarchs. In 1988, a rancher murdered Chico Mendes, the globally renowned rubber tapper who had tried to protect the rainforest from illegal exploitation. Seventeen years later Dorothy Stang, an American nun and advocate for the poor, was shot down by two hit men on a jungle road near the town of Anapu after mounting death threats against her. Those high-profile crimes were quickly solved, but other killers carried out their crimes with impunity. Of the 2,000 environmental activists and land defenders murdered worldwide in the 21st century, one-third have been Brazilian — the majority from the Amazon region.
In “Masters of the Lost Land,” Heriberto Araujo set out to document this ongoing conflict in one bloody corner of Brazil’s wild north. A Spanish journalist who relocated to Brazil from China in 2013, Araujo was quickly swept up in the region’s biggest story: the destruction of the rainforest and the role it plays in accelerating global warming. Intrigued by the human drama behind the catastrophe, he decided, he writes, “to capture, in a single narrative, the factors that have made the largest rainforest on Earth the world’s most dangerous place for environmental and land activists.” The result is an often gripping, sometimes unwieldy narrative that spans five decades and follows the lives of a large cast of characters, from labor leaders to low-level hit men, from criminal bosses to the government officials who abet them.
Araujo’s story unfolds in and around Rondon do Pará, a town in Pará State — a remote and lawless swath of northern Brazil. When he first visited Rondon do Pará several years ago, Araujo encountered a small metropolis with shops and bars where locals “drank chilled beers as they listened to sertanejo, Brazil’s answer to country music, and watched football matches on LCD televisions.” But the city’s sheen of modernity obscured its origins as a Brazilian “Deadwood.” Thrown up as a transient camp for highway construction crews, Rondon do Pará had been a refuge for poor homesteaders before a July 1969 attack on a nearby farm by bow-and-arrow-wielding warriors of the Gaviao Kyikateje tribe. After the government rounded up the Indians and transported them to a reservation, the town’s population grew tenfold. Wealthy landowners, known as fazendeiros, cleared the forests through slash-and-burn operations, staffed their ranches with indentured laborers and enforced control over their territory with an army of gunmen, or pistoleiros.
Image
One of the principal villains of Araujo’s narrative is Josélio de Barros Carneiro, the scion of a cattle-ranching family from the southeastern coastal state of Espírito Santo. In 1967 Josélio organized the assassination there of a political rival, a police major, in a hail of cyanide-tipped bullets fired by three hit men in a bar. After serving several years in prison, Josélio escaped possible retribution from his victim’s family by taking refuge in Rondon de Pará, where he cleared forests and became one of the area’s wealthiest ranchers. According to the testimony of a laborer at one of Josélio’s ranches, however, he had failed to relinquish his murderous ways. In 1994 the laborer led investigators to a field littered with human remains — allegedly a burial ground for workers who had complained about their miserable working conditions or tried to escape and were dispatched by hit men.
Josélio’s apparent crimes brought him to the attention of José Dutra da Costa, known as Dezinho, the charismatic leader of Rondon do Pará’s rural workers’ union, founded in 1982 to help peasant farmers obtain pensions and financial benefits from the government. “A short paunchy man … with curly ink-colored hair and glittering black eyes,” Dezinho pressed the police to investigate Josélio. (The case was eventually dropped owing to a lack of evidence.) Inspired by the progressive politician Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was elected to Brazil’s congress in 1986 — he would go on to win the presidency, most recently in October, his second stint in the job — Dezinho moved deeper into political activism. He drew attention to the fazendeiros’ practice of acquiring land by using fraudulent deeds, known as grilagem, derived from the Portuguese word for crickets, so called because the fake contracts were often aged artificially with the insects’ droppings. To pressure the government to confiscate illegally acquired properties, Dezinho organized mass occupations of the disputed land — a strategy that placed him in the sights of the region’s corrupt overlords. In November 2000, a hired gunman shot him dead outside his home.
Dezinho’s murder thrust his widow, Maria Joel Dias Da Costa, into a prominent role in Amazonian activism. Much of the rest of Araujo’s narrative is devoted to her yearslong effort to bring the conspirators to justice. As well as suspecting the now middle-aged Josélio of involvement in the crime, Maria Joel zeroed in on Décio José Barroso Nunes, the “King of Wood,” whose vast empire included timber plantations, cattle ranches, sawmills, fleets of trucks, supermarkets and a coffee-processing plant. He was also an alleged tax dodger, trader in black market lumber and killer who was rumored to toss intransigent workers into a pool of alligators at his main ranch. Maria Joel’s relentless campaign, backed by a sympathetic police detective, helped to bring about the confiscation of many of Nunes’s assets, but corrupt judges and other protectors have enabled him to dodge jail time.
Araujo tries mightily to keep the momentum of his narrative going, but his cavalcade of hit men, peasant victims, rapacious landowners, criminal attorneys, police officers and others caught up in the violence becomes difficult to keep track of, and many of the stories blur. Moreover, the hero of Araujo’s tale, Maria Joel, never emerges as a fully realized protagonist, often given to fortune-cookie pronouncements such as: “The seed planted never stops growing and eventually bears fruit” and “You should care about the jungle, but never forget about us.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Still, Araujo’s accretion of detail has a powerful effect, demonstrating how deeply the culture of violence has seeped into the social fabric of Amazonia — and how hard it will be to eradicate. The June 2022 murders of the British journalist Dom Phillips and the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, shot dead while investigating illegal exploitation of tribal land in the Javari Valley, serve as a reminder that the bloodshed continues unabated, along with environmental depredation. Under President Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, climate change skeptic and ally of Brazil’s powerful agriculture lobby, 4,500 square miles of Amazon rainforest — an area nearly half the size of Massachusetts — disappeared between 2021 and 2022, more than double the amount destroyed in 2018. Bolsonaro’s defeat by Lula da Silva last fall cheered environmentalists, but few believe that the new administration can find an easy end to the cycle of violence. As a judge in a case against one lawbreaking rancher said recently, after receiving a death threat, “We live in a democracy still under construction.”

A deadly strike on a Ukrainian apartment building
A missile built to sink ships exploded in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Saturday, hitting a nine-story apartment building. As of yesterday, 30 people were confirmed killed, 79 were injured and at least 30 people remained unaccounted for. It was one of the largest losses of civilian lives far from the front line since the beginning of the war.
A week before, Russia had launched dozens of missiles across Ukraine in two waves of strikes that coincided with the Orthodox New Year. Deliberately or recklessly attacking civilian populations in this way is widely considered a war crime. It comes after months of Russian assaults on infrastructure targets that provide power, heat and water.
Immediately after the attack, pro-Russian news outlets and military bloggers claimed that the apartment building was not the target but had been struck by fragments of the missile after Ukrainian air defenses tried to intercept it. Ukrainian forces were quick to deny that, and evidence from the scene pointed to a direct strike on the building.
Location: Dnipro, a city nestled against the river of the same name, had a population of just under one million before the war began. Although targeted by Russian shelling, the city has never been occupied by Russian forces or been the scene of frontline fighting. The city has been home to displaced people who have flocked to its relative safety.

World leaders gather in Davos
The World Economic Forum starts today in Davos, Switzerland. On the agenda: international fracture, nationalism and protectionism under the shadow of war in Europe and sharp tensions between the U.S. and China.
Politicians, executives, environmentalists and other leaders will wrestle with questions about the threat to supply chains, fears of nuclear “Armageddon” provoked by the war in Ukraine and the looming threat of a global recession. Power is shifting away from the U.S. as China’s military and economic heft grows, but the shape of an alternative international system is unclear.
Europe’s crises will be the undercurrent jolting discussions. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, both the E.U. and NATO have remained mostly united. But there are continuing differences among member states, including over how to work with allies and NATO.

Israel’s new hard-right government
Three weeks in, Israel’s government, the most right-wing in the country’s history, is quickly pressing ahead with legislation that critics fear will erode Israeli democracy. Benjamin Netanyahu has returned as prime minister, this time leading a coalition of conservative, far-right and ultra-Orthodox parties.
Isabel Kershner, a correspondent in The Times’s Jerusalem bureau, spoke to The Morning newsletter about the right’s push to transform Israel. This is a lightly edited extract.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
What is the new government trying to accomplish?
The right-wing parties in the coalition are all extremely ideological, and Netanyahu has made a lot of concessions to them. The new hard-right finance minister is claiming more authority over Jewish settlements and civilian affairs in the occupied West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers want more autonomy and more funding for religious students and schools.
The government is also moving to radically overhaul the judiciary. The coalition wants to give Parliament more power to select judges and override Supreme Court rulings. Critics say the coalition’s proposed changes would completely change the nature of Israel’s liberal democracy, which is dynamic but also fragile.
What does the new government mean for relations with the Palestinians?
The levels of confidence are below zero. The previous Israeli government, which for the first time included a small Islamic Arab party in the governing coalition, prioritized fighting crime in conjunction with Arab local authorities. Now the minister overseeing the police has a history of being an anti-Arab activist and provocateur. The situation regarding the Palestinians in the occupied territories was already tense, and things have quickly become confrontational.
How has all this left Israelis feeling about the state of their politics?
There was a pro-L.G.B.T.Q. protest on the day the new government was sworn in because Netanyahu’s coalition includes some extremely anti-gay lawmakers. There have since been protests, including a big one on Saturday night, in Tel Aviv, a more secular, liberal city about an hour from Jerusalem.
Things here feel more polarized than ever, and there’s a lot at stake. The country is split over what kind of democracy Israel should be and how it’s going to relate to Palestinians. Even among the half of the country that did vote for a right-wing party, not all of them are happy.

‘Based on a true story’
The entertainment genre of historical drama is flourishing — and riddled with inaccuracies, which range from embellishments to major fabrications. The untrue parts are leading to more public spats and lawsuits, Jeremy W. Peters and Nicole Sperling report.
Disclaimers like the ones featured in “The Crown” are sometimes enough to protect a studio from legal liability, especially if they are prominently displayed and offer detail of what has been fictionalized, legal experts say. But if someone can convincingly claim that he or she was harmed by what screenwriters made up, that is grounds for a strong defamation suit.
Defamation experts and Hollywood studios are closely watching developments in a lawsuit filed by a former prosecutor depicted in a Netflix series about the “Central Park Five” case. A federal judge ruled that her claims of defamation in five separate scenes in the series were plausible, and the case is proceeding in U.S. District Court.

2023-01-17,"What I’d heard of a little Brazilian town on the eastern edge of the Amazon had prepared me for the worst. Criminality plagues many areas of Brazil, and the government’s presence remains feeble in the interior of the country. But even by that measure, the pace of homicides in the region is staggering. “It’s a risky town for a reporter,” said Danicley de Aguiar, a Greenpeace activist.
I first went to the town, Rondon do Pará, in Pará state, in 2017, to understand why and when the jungle had become not only a front line of climate change but also to get to the root of the conflicts that have made the largest rainforest on earth the world’s most dangerous place for environmental and land activists.
Even today, as the new Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has promised to focus his government’s efforts on preserving the rainforest, the activists’ stories rarely reach international audiences. When they do, it’s because reporters retrace the lives of the victims, at great personal risk. “You should go and contact the people of the local rural workers’ union,” Mr. de Aguiar told me.
Rondon do Pará has a history typical of its time and place. In the late 1960s, when the Brazilian government decided to build a grid of highways penetrating the hinterlands, settlers moved into the lands of the Gavião Kyikatêjê people. Eventually the Gavião Kyikatêjê were removed and settlers began to carve out gardens, farms and cattle ranches. In the years that followed, wealthy ranchers and land sharks moved in. As did migrants and landless poor farmers from Maranhão, one of Brazil’s poorest states, in search of a plot of land or work.

One of them was Gil, who in the 1990s migrated to Paragominas, a town in Pará state that at the time was described as one of the world’s logging capitals. There, he met a recruiter who offered him work on a large fazenda, or estate, some 100 miles from Rondon do Pará. He was driven down an unpaved, rutted road punching into the jungle. He would later tell the police that once there he was instructed not to leave the property without approval and was put to work clearing the land without pay.

A few months later, Gil pushed through the brambly vegetation to investigate the strange cloud of dark smoke rising above the canopy. He expected to find brush set ablaze to clear the land. Instead, he found smoldering embers — a mix of human remains and old tires. He believed that the remains belonged to a co-worker who had complained about not being paid. Gil eventually managed to escape to Rondon do Pará, where he sought help from the president of the local rural workers’ union, Jose Dutra da Costa, who was known as Dezinho.
The paunchy and determined social leader suspected that the fazenda — owned by a cattleman with a criminal record for murder — was riddled with human rights abuses. In the early morning of June 27, 1995, the police raided the estate and unearthed carbonized human remains. Witnesses testified to the police that murders, threats and debt bondage were widespread at the ranch. The case made the front pages of local newspapers. Yet no one was prosecuted.
In many areas of Brazil, impunity rules in the absence of rule of law. Data from the Pastoral Land Commission shows that from 1985 to 2018, about 92 percent of all land- and resource-related murders logged in Brazil — some 1,790 in total, most of them in the Amazon — resulted in no arrest or trial. Even when powerful criminals are convicted, they often avoid jail time by filing any number of appeals and exploiting the flaws in the legal system.
While the pervasiveness of debt bondage in the frontier has substantially diminished, it continues to ensnare hundreds of laborers.

For years, Dezinho shrugged off the death threats he received for encouraging poor settlers to stand up to ranchers and loggers. It cost him everything: In November 2000, he was shot at point-blank range by a hit man. The police investigating the case uncovered a local criminal network in which ranchers, corrupted officers and gunmen were said to work together to silence opponents. A key witness told the police that “they decided who lived and who was murdered in town.”
What followed was a quest for justice that continues to this day, both in Brazil and in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Dezinho’s killer was arrested and convicted, but he soon escaped and was never found again. The mastermind, a wealthy cattleman who now exports beef as far as Hong Kong, was also arrested, prosecuted and convicted of murder in jury trials held in 2014 and 2019. He never served jail time, and over two decades after the murder, his case is still under appeal because a judge has allowed him to appeal at liberty.
He still lives in Rondon do Pará. Dezinho’s widow, Maria Joel Dias da Costa, also lives in the town with her four children. Ms. Dias now leads the rural workers’ union and denounces human rights abuses in that area of the Amazon. Since 2004, she has lived under state protection, guarded round-the-clock. The same warnings once directed at her husband are now aimed at her. She said that when she first met Mr. Lula in May 19, 2005, then in his first term, she told him, “I don’t want to die, Mr. President.”
In the 21st century alone, more than 2,000 people have been killed worldwide for defending their lands or the environment. Brazil accounts for about a third of these homicides, with most of them occurring in the Amazon. Pará sits at the top of the list of the most lethal states, and murder is just the most extreme tactic used to silence campaigners. Campaigners also suffer death threats and nonlethal physical attacks; female activists face sexual assault.
The Amazon, especially under former President Jair Bolsonaro, has received extensive attention over issues like deforestation rates and threats to environmental activists. But we know little — too little — about the daily struggles of defenders, either Indigenous communities fighting to preserve their traditional lands or grass-roots activists like Dezinho and Ms. Dias, who have been crucial in exposing the lawlessness expanding throughout the frontier.

“Our goal is to achieve zero deforestation in the Amazon,” Mr. Lula said in his inauguration speech on Jan. 1, just a week before rioters ransacked government buildings in Brasília. “Brazil does not need to deforest in order to maintain and expand its strategic agricultural frontier,” he added.
Accountability will be central to Mr. Lula’s pledge. For too long, the fate of the rainforest has rested on the shoulders of environmental campaigners, Indigenous leaders, land activists and courageous and determined judges, prosecutors and state and federal investigators. But social and ecological advances in society can’t rely on martyrs.
One of the last times I met Ms. Dias, I asked her what she thought about how her work had contributed to making Rondon do Pará a more just place for the poor. “They took Dezinho,” she said. “But the seed planted never stops growing and bears fruit.”

2023-01-18,"The lot on West 145th Street in Manhattan was envisioned as a $700 million high-rise complex, with a civil rights museum and hundreds of below-market-rate apartments.
But after a local councilwoman protested, arguing that the project would bring more gentrification, the developer, Bruce Teitelbaum, gave an ultimatum: Unless his proposal was reconsidered, he would build a loud and unsightly truck depot.
On Wednesday, the trucks began to roll in.
“This is not the result we planned or hoped for on 145th Street,” said Mr. Teitelbaum, once an aide to former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. “But without someone who is willing to find common ground and compromise, we have no other viable alternative or choices.”
The councilwoman, Kristin Richardson Jordan, who faces re-election this year, has said she made the right decision. She has argued that the so-called affordable units would still have been too expensive for working-class residents.
ADVERTISEMENT

She said she would have agreed to the project had Mr. Teitelbaum agreed to include more homes that were affordable to people with lower incomes — making a fifth of the apartments available to families of four earning $40,020 per year, for example, and reserving half of the apartments for families of four earning up to about $80,040.
“Let’s be clear, that is already an extreme compromise and is still quite awful and would be a total financial windfall for this developer making him and his investors plenty of profit,” she said. “And he should have taken it.”
At a time when New York City faces a housing shortage, the tug of war over the Harlem project appears to be a case study in how the powerful whims of developers and the morass of local politics can make it difficult to build new homes.
It also provides a unique look into the high-stakes nature of housing in New York City. By choosing to park trucks on the lot, Mr. Teitelbaum has raised the cost to the community of rejecting his vision, raising the question of whether other developers might follow suit and use publicity-driven tactics to influence local politics.
At the same time, the drama of the Harlem case, and perhaps the threat that developers might try similar tactics elsewhere, has helped prompt a new spirit of cooperation among real estate executives and elected officials to find ways to make deals. Left-leaning City Council members recently backed two new affordable housing projects in Queens after negotiating with developers for more benefits for the community.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The 51-seat City Council has an unspoken tradition, known as member deference, that allows a council member to effectively veto land-use proposals in their district — a process that gave Ms. Jordan a decisive voice in the Harlem project. Her opposition signaled it would face steep hurdles. It never came to a vote.
The yearslong fight over the Harlem housing project, known as One45, has been acrimonious, culminating in the arrival of the trucks on Wednesday at the new “Park Your Fleet” facility. Mr. Teitelbaum stood nearby, theatrically waving toward the more than 10 trucks idling around him.
“This is my dream,” Mr. Teitelbaum said, his voice laced with sarcasm.
Iesha Sekou, a local activist with office space across the street from the depot, shouted at Mr. Teitelbaum from the sidewalk behind the chain-link fence, insisting that the depot would harm local children who suffered from asthma.
“He’s doing this as revenge,” said Ms. Sekou, founder of Street Corner Resources.
A man seated in the driver’s seat in one of the trucks said his boss had told him to come to the depot and sit for a couple hours.
On Wednesday, Ms. Jordan asked state officials to shut down the depot over environmental concerns.
Mr. Teitelbaum said he was not being vindictive and that he could not let the lot sit empty. He said he was considering building a smaller luxury apartment building, a self-storage facility or parking on the block, which would not require City Council approval. He also said that the original proposal needed to contain some market-rate units to make it profitable.

“What is the point in restarting a totally unpredictable process that is doomed from the get-go?” Mr. Teitelbaum said.

The developer’s most recent proposal, in May, which would have been contingent on a city subsidy, called for about 10 percent of the 915 apartments to be affordable to seniors and people at risk of homelessness, including those with a family of four who earn up to $40,020 per year. Some 13 percent of the apartments considered “affordable” would have targeted families earning closer to $160,000.
Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, has supported Mr. Teitelbaum’s proposal, and the mayor’s office said on Wednesday that he wanted to see housing on the site, not a truck depot. Charles Kretchmer Lutvak, a spokesman for the mayor, said that the Adams administration would “continue working with all of our partners on a comprehensive effort to bring much-needed affordable housing to Harlem and every neighborhood in New York City.”
Don Curtis, president of the United Black Caucus, a civil rights group that organized people living in the neighborhood to fight the development, said he thought Mr. Teitelbaum was “bluffing” because he wanted to soften any potential opposition to a future development on the site.

Mr. Curtis said he would have supported a project that provided jobs to people in the neighborhood and lower-cost homes.
“It would have been the tallest structure in all of Harlem,” he said. “It wouldn’t have benefited the community.”
Ms. Jordan, whose Twitter account had disappeared on Wednesday, identifies as a Black socialist, though groups like the Democratic Socialists of America and the left-wing Working Families Party did not endorse her in the 2021 primary, which she won by around 100 votes.
Earlier this month, she held a “Harlem Not For Sale” rally to oppose the truck depot. She said the community should not have to choose between a “high-rise luxury apartment complex that will displace our people in the last Black community in Manhattan and a truck stop that will add to the already dire levels of asthma in our community.”
Before the pandemic, major proposals like a rezoning of Industry City in Brooklyn and a proposed new headquarters for Amazon in Queens were halted over concerns that they would not benefit the neighborhoods surrounding them. But with growing concerns over affordability in the city, elected officials have been more eager to work with developers.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The City Council speaker, Adrienne E. Adams, has signaled that she is open to ending member deference, saying that she values community input, but not “irrational opposition that rejects desperately needed housing.” Ms. Adams helped negotiate the recent approval of a $2 billion development known as Innovation Queens that includes five towers and will add more than 3,000 homes in Astoria.
Mandela Jones, a spokesman for Ms. Adams, said on Wednesday that it was “unfortunate” that the Harlem housing proposal “fell short of the community investment, partnership and trust necessary to advance with support.”
“We need to develop more housing at deeper affordability in every corner of the city to address this housing crisis, and the Council continues to consider all projects that seek to accomplish this goal for communities in good faith,” he said.
The Manhattan borough president, Mark Levine, said this week that the city should make another attempt at rezoning the Harlem site to build affordable housing. He said that the earlier proposal was “not perfect” but it had met the goal of offering half affordable units.
“I’m optimistic that this is doable,” he said. “It’s going to take work and it’s going to take compromise.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Anita Laremont, a former chair of the City Planning Commission and executive director of the city planning department under Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that even if the neighborhood and the city prefer housing, land use rules may give Mr. Teitelbaum the right to go forward with the truck depot. She said that “letting what somebody’s conception of perfect is be the enemy of the good can result in consequences that are worse for the community.”
But, she added, “I’m not sure if one is looking to build relationships with the community, that the sort of histrionics of this approach is the best way to do it.”

Reed Hastings will become executive chairman.

Winnie Au for The New York Times
A streaming pioneer steps back
For 25 years, Reed Hastings was not only Netflix’s co-founder, but also its most visible cheerleader and advocate. Yesterday he announced that he would relinquish his co-C.E.O. title to a top deputy and become executive chairman.
The change comes as the streaming giant grapples with one of the most challenging moments in its history: Competitors are coming on strong, and Wall Street is keeping a close eye on its bottom line.
Mr. Hastings’s move had long been in the works. “Our board has been discussing succession planning for many years,” he wrote in a corporate blog post, comparing the move to the changing of the guard at other tech companies — think Jeff Bezos at Amazon last year, or Bill Gates at Microsoft — to give way to the next generation of leadership. (It’s hard not to compare the relative smoothness of this transition to, say, that of a key Netflix rival, Disney.)
Who’s stepping up? Picking up the co-C.E.O. role is Greg Peters, an architect of Netflix’s much-anticipated ad-supported subscription offering, who’ll share the title with the longtime Hastings lieutenant Ted Sarandos. (Setting tongues wagging in Hollywood was the additional news that Bela Bajaria, the company’s head of television who was recently profiled in The New Yorker, was promoted to chief content officer.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Does Mr. Hastings’s move signal anything about Netflix’s prospects? Over the past year, the company has sought to reassure investors about a number of issues, including:
Slowing subscriber growth, plus an actual drop in subscriber numbers last year, which drove a sharp slide in its stock.
Advances by rivals like Disney and Amazon, a tough thing to swallow for a company that regularly says its main competition includes sleep.
Its own multibillion-dollar debt-financed binging on content production, without a clear sense of the return on that investment.
Those challenges prompted Mr. Hastings, who said he had been largely delegating day-to-day management over the past two-and-a-half years, to become more hands-on again. (His reasserted presence was also seen as important as Netflix began taking steps it had long dismissed as unnecessary, like launching the cheaper, ad-supported service and cracking down on password sharing.) Recode’s Peter Kafka surmises that Mr. Hastings’s willingness to change roles might mean he believes Netflix has put the worst behind it. And investors sent shares higher in premarket trading.
Of course, it helped that Netflix had good financial news to report alongside its leadership transition, including better-than-expected subscriber and revenue growth. The question now is whether Netflix is truly in the clear, and whether Mr. Hastings will truly step back as Bezos has thus far — or find that he has to reassert himself again.

Google’s parent company will cut 12,000 jobs. Alphabet announced the layoffs, amounting to 6 percent of its work force, this morning. The move puts Alphabet alongside Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and other Silicon Valley titans in turning to job cuts to grapple with a slowdown in digital advertising and the economy more broadly.
The U.S. begins “extraordinary measures” to avert default. As the country hit the debt ceiling yesterday, the Treasury Department began moving money around to ensure the government can meet its financial obligations and avoid economic disruption or a default. Expect a long slog to end the standoff.
The crypto lender Genesis files for bankruptcy. The embattled company sought Chapter 11 after struggling in the wake of FTX’s collapse. It’s the latest blow to Genesis’s parent company, Digital Currency Group; another part of the crypto conglomerate, the industry publication CoinDesk, has hired Lazard to help it explore a sale.
A fat-fingered computer error is to blame for the F.A.A.’s computer outage.

Companies that once hoped to avoid Karl Racine, the former attorney general of the District of Columbia who was known for taking on corporate giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google, might soon be seeking him out. Mr. Racine joined the law firm Hogan Lovells this week to lead a practice for clients dealing with state-led campaigns over everything from consumer rights and antitrust to environmental, social and corporate governance, or E.S.G., initiatives.
Mr. Racine spoke with DealBook about expected developments. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

What’s next in the E.S.G. wars?
We’ve seen governors and treasurers go out and seek to pull money out of certain pension funds because they claim that investment managers are using E.S.G. inappropriately. Well, one can foresee that beneficiaries — having seen the record of returns of the investment managers who are being penalized for using E.S.G. — could organize and tell those states to keep politics out of the investment world.
Can businesses push back?
The Kentucky Bankers Association recently sued the attorney general there to enjoin his investigation into financial institutions’ use of E.S.G. That is significant litigation, and I think that you’re gonna see more and more of this.
What else are you watching?
The area of covenants not to compete is very striking and important, and we saw the F.T.C. move into that arena pretty broadly. The noncompete historically has been used to really restrict and limit hourly wage workers just working to make ends meet. Once you start banning noncompetes all across the board, you’ve got to be really attentive as to what the impacts are and why companies devote time, energy and resources to recruiting and training and promoting people.
What big theme do you see emerging in 2023?
The whole idea of government increasingly playing a role in business and the politicization of how businesses choose to operate. I think you’re going to see a lot around that subject matter, namely about government intrusion into the workings of business.

Spot the “snow leopards”
What are the current trends that could change the future? Nassim Nicholas Taleb popularized the idea that the most consequential “black swan” events are often unpredictable. The Atlantic Council, a think tank, uses the term “snow leopards” to describe phenomena that could change the course of history, but that most of us may miss. DealBook got a first look at its list for this year.
A push to regulate algorithms is gathering pace. They influence what we see online, direct us on GPS and drive advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Governments are increasingly calling for stricter rules to rein in algorithms and make creators liable for any harm they cause, but expect Big Tech to push back.
Battery tech could democratize EV ownership. Electric vehicles could become cheaper and more efficient thanks to a shift in how battery tech is used. Structural batteries built into a car’s frame can reduce weight, improve its range and cut production costs.
Geoengineering may have unintended consequences. China and the United Arab Emirates are “seeding” clouds, and India and the U.S. are making advances in geoengineering, interventions in the environment to mitigate climate change. But the projects could also alter regional weather patterns, and there’s a danger that some countries may act unilaterally before the effects are well understood.
Pre-emptive corporate decoupling from China may accelerate. As tensions between the West and China escalate, wary corporations that fled Russia last year may shift away from China before they’re forced to do so. Notably, Apple is reportedly trying to shift some iPhone production to India, and Alphabet might move some Google Pixel phone manufacturing to Vietnam.
Two key U.S. allies could reconcile and shake up the Indo-Pacific. Japan and South Korea have been at loggerheads for years over grievances that date back to World War II. But there are signs that the neighbors — which each host tens of thousands of American troops — could overcome their differences, a move that would bolster the U.S.’s efforts to present a united front against a more assertive China, North Korea and Russia.
Platform workers are organizing worldwide. Non-contract workers who provide delivery, driving and other services through online platforms are fighting for better conditions and pay, with strikes and protests in Brazil, Britain and the Philippines an indication of a rising movement. Those efforts could lead to more government protections for many in the informal economy.

2023-01-21,"For a stretch of the pandemic, tech companies couldn’t hire fast enough. Talent wars broke out in Silicon Valley, with firms vying for software engineers, often lavishing extravagant perks on their new and would-be hires. As profits soared, executives acted as if the party would never end.
Now, it has — and workers are bearing the brunt of pullbacks. Nearly 200,000 tech employees have been laid off since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts in the sector. Four of the largest tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft — have announced a total of more than 50,000 job cuts in recent months.
But even after significant cuts, the largest tech companies are still behemoths. They grew enormously during the pandemic, adding tens of thousands of workers. The layoffs announced in recent weeks reverse a fraction of the hiring done in recent years.
In announcing the layoffs to employees, executives struck notably apologetic tones, expressing regrets about overzealous expansion and rapid hiring. The executives pointed to economic factors, made worse by inflation and rising interest rates. But they are also admitting that they over-hired, misreading the durability of the pandemic acceleration in the growth of online services.

2023-01-24,"The last three years have fundamentally reshaped working life in ways that could very well be permanent. The pandemic ushered remote work into the mainstream (a new normal that has proved resilient despite some managers’ best efforts), precipitated a surge in entrepreneurial activity and prompted a trend that’s been called “The Great Resignation.” Record numbers of Americans have quit their jobs altogether, while others are redressing their work-life balance by “quiet quitting.” But now there are signs that the white-hot labor market is cooling, with layoffs increasingly widespread and many experts predicting a recession. Whether you’re on the cusp of a career pivot, considering starting a business or just trying to navigate office politics at your current job, these six podcasts will help you figure out those next steps.
‘ZigZag’
Podcast fans are likely familiar with the voice of Manoush Zomorodi, a longtime host of WNYC’s “Note to Self,” who originally started this show to chronicle a career pivot. In 2018, Zomorodi and Jen Poyant, then her co-host, both quit their public radio jobs to launch their own crypto-funded production company, with the goal of finding a kinder, more sustainable approach to entrepreneurship. The first three seasons of “ZigZag” charted the ups and downs of that experience in compelling and vulnerable fashion, and post-pandemic the show has shape-shifted to focus on interviews with “unusual dynamos” who defy business norms (like Ben Chestnut, a co-founder of MailChimp who has refused to take money from venture capitalists). More recently, the sixth season sees Zomorodi sharing a step-by-step road map for listeners seeking a career reset.

‘The Art of Speaking Up’
A wealth of evidence has established that women face unique challenges in the workplace: They are less likely to speak up; more likely to underestimate their value; and face the so-called “double bind” dilemma of being perceived as either competent or likable in leadership roles, but not both. And while standard advice often focuses on telling women how to change their behavior without addressing the psychology and socialization that underpin it, “The Art of Speaking Up” tackles both. Inspired by her own experiences of intense impostor syndrome at her first corporate job, Jessica Guzik started this podcast five years ago, and has since released more than 200 episodes covering subjects including salary negotiation, working motherhood and the contentious (and gendered) role of the exclamation point in work emails.

Jonathan Fields, the host, interviews guests from all walks of life including authors, doctors and psychologists, many of whom share stories of the experiences that changed their outlook or offer novel ways to approach familiar problems. At a time when so many people are reconsidering their relationship with work, the show’s holistic approach to fulfillment is bound to resonate.

Subsequent seasons have delved into the rocky origin stories of other companies, including a matchmaking app called Dating Ring and the video streaming company Twitch (now owned by Amazon). But perhaps the most essential season of all is the most recent, which offered a welcome change from tech-focused startup stories in chronicling the founding of Success Academy, New York City’s polarizing network of charter schools.

2023-01-25,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it has banned logging and road-building on about nine million acres of the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska, aiming to settle a two-decade battle over the fate of North America’s largest temperate rainforest.
The new rule reinstates protections in the pristine Alaskan back country that were first imposed in 2001 but stripped away by President Donald J. Trump in 2020.
Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said the effort would protect cedar, hemlock and Sitka spruce trees — many of them more than 800 years old — that provide essential habitats for 400 species of wildlife, including bald eagles, salmon and the world’s greatest concentration of black bears. The towering trees also play an essential role in fighting climate change. They store more than 10 percent of the carbon accumulated by all national forests in the United States, according to the government.

In addition to prohibiting road construction — a first step toward new logging — the United States Forest Service plan also puts an end to large scale logging of old growth timber across the forest’s entire 16 million acres.
“As our nation’s largest national forest and the largest intact temperate rainforest in the world, the Tongass National Forest is key to conserving biodiversity and addressing the climate crisis,” Mr. Vilsack said in a statement. Restoring the road prohibitions “listens to the voices of Tribal Nations and the people of Southeast Alaska while recognizing the importance of fishing and tourism to the region’s economy,” he said.
Tongass National Forest, which has been called “America’s Amazon,” is also home to rare earth minerals, making it a place of intense interest to state and local leaders who say it should be mined to create jobs and bolster Alaska’s economy.

Senator Dan Sullivan, the Alaska Republican, called the rule “overly-burdensome,” accused the Biden administration of harming his state’s economy and said he would retaliate by blocking the president’s nominees.

“I’ve implored Secretary Vilsack repeatedly to work with us and to not lock up our state,” Mr. Sullivan said in a statement. “My message to hard-working Alaskans who are being crushed and utterly disregarded by this administration: I will fight this decision with everything in my power, including through my Senate oversight responsibilities and by holding relevant nominees wherever possible.”
The state’s Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, said in a statement that the final rule “is a huge loss for Alaskans” and accused the Biden administration of treating his state unfairly. “Alaskans deserve access to the resources that the Tongass provides — jobs, renewable energy resources and tourism, not a government plan that treats human beings within a working forest like an invasive species,” he wrote.
Jim Clark, an attorney in Juneau who has been working with industry and state officials to keep Tongass exempt from the protections that apply to much of the National Forest system, has argued to the Biden administration that the economic benefits of some road construction are critical and can be achieved without harming the ecology. He noted that the national forest is about the size of West Virginia, and can accommodate what he described as limited infrastructure.
In 2008 the United States Geological Survey found 148 mineral deposits in the region. State leaders have argued that an updated survey should be completed before any new restrictions are imposed so the government and the public is aware of the full economic potential that could be lost.
The number of jobs linked to the timber industry in Southeast Alaska near the Tongass National Forest has declined from 3,543 in 1991 to 312 in 2022 — the lowest timber employment level ever recorded — according to the Southeast Conference, the regional economic development organization.

Timber executives said years of restrictions imposed by Democrats have run lumber companies out of the region.
Tessa Axelson, executive director of the Alaska Forest Association, which represents timber companies in Southeast Alaska, said the industry is “disappointed but not surprised” by the rule. “Our local economies cannot survive without the investments of small businesses like those in the forest products industry. This announcement further threatens an already precarious environment for our operators,” she said.
Democrats and Republicans have fought over the Tongass for decades, with environmentalists, some Native tribes and Democrats fighting to preserve the forest while Republicans, timber companies and mining executives argued for its development.
A group of southeast Alaska tribal leaders issued a statement praising the rule. They said it signals a commitment from the government to “address the climate crisis and finally listen to the Southeast Tribes that will continue to be most impacted by climate change.”

The decision is the latest in a series of Biden administration moves reversing actions by Mr. Trump designed to ease the way for fossil fuel development and mineral extraction on public lands. Last month, the Biden administration extended protections to rivers, marshes and waterways that the Trump administration tried to repeal. The White House also issued new directives for assessing greenhouse gas emissions in federal environmental reviews, replacing guidelines that had been withdrawn by Mr. Trump.

Conservationists and several Alaskan native groups applauded the Tongass decision. They have argued that allowing road construction could devastate the vast wilderness of snowy peaks, rushing rivers and virgin old-growth forest.
“This is great news for the forest, the salmon, the wildlife, and the people who depend on intact ecosystems to support their ways of life and livelihoods,” Kate Glover, an attorney for Earthjustice, an environmental group, said in a statement.
Forest Service officials said the agency received about 112,000 comments from tribes, rural communities and others affected by the rule and found that the majority wanted to ban roads in the forest.
While Tongass National Forest represents about 9 percent of the entire lands in the national forest system, it has about 16 percent of forest areas that are roadless. Most of those are old-growth forests.

Dominick DellaSala, a conservation biologist who has studied Tongass, called it “remarkable” and noted that most of the nation’s old growth trees in the lower 48 states were logged decades ago.
Tongass, he said, is “a place where eagles are as abundant as house sparrows, salmon clog streams like rush-hour traffic and wolves feed on salmon carcasses.” All of the species, he said, “do best in unlogged forests.”
The new plan also includes $25 million in federal spending on local sustainable development in Alaska, for projects to improve the health of the forest."
2023-01-26,"American adolescents from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints trek to Finland for missionary service in the pallid documentary “The Mission.” Directed by Tania Anderson, the film opens with its young subjects preparing for their travels, and then tracks their two-year journeys and the challenges that attend the substantial undertaking.
One hopes that such access would yield new insights into the church. But as the events unspool, the film struggles to crystallize more than a handful of compelling points.
The documentary spends time with four missionaries in particular: Sister Bills, Sister Field, Elder Davis and Elder Pauole. (The church frowns upon the use of first names.) The young women are sunny. The young men are stolid. Beyond their general dispositions and their aptitude for Finnish, which each of them are asked to study, the film fails to bring them to life as individuals.

Upon arrival in Finland, the missionaries receive companions who serve as their roommates and proselytizing partners. The kids are instructed not to leave one another’s sight, a rule that we later learn is meant to prime the adolescents for marriage, which awaits them at home. This vital detail is obscured, however, by our surface-level time with the pairs. We see them pray side by side and knock on Finns’ doors, but before the camera, the companions default to reticence.
Being a teenager is tough enough, and living for years in a foreign city must add stress to the usual malaise. Unfortunately, Anderson’s camera feels like an outsider to this unease, less a window into a demanding time than an obstacle to our understanding.

2023-01-27,"They marched through the streets of Peru’s capital, carrying signs that said “I’m not a terrorist” and waved rainbow-colored flags associated with Indigenous communities in the Andes. Many chant “murderer” at the country’s leader and sing hymns about not being afraid anymore. On Thursday, more continued to arrive, with many vowing to stay for the long fight.
In the past week, thousands of rural Peruvians have descended on Lima to join local protests calling on President Dina Boluarte to resign following the ouster in December of the country’s former leader after he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree.
The growing demonstrations in the capital follow seven weeks of protests around the country that show little sign of abating. Instead, Peru has found itself at an ugly impasse with the government doubling down on portraying demonstrators as pawns for drug-traffickers, illegal miners and terrorist groups who are trying to sow chaos, according to Ms. Boluarte.
Day by day, the protests seem to grow more chaotic.
The ongoing showdown has ratcheted up the polarization of the country, which has been convulsed by what is already its deadliest conflict this century.
Since Ms. Boluarte took office on Dec. 7, violent protests against her government have paralyzed large swaths of southern Peru, shutting down copper and tin mines and choking off highways leading to Lima and towns in the Amazon.
There have been at least 57 deaths related to the unrest, all outside of Lima. Forty-six civilians were killed in clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers, including 17 during a day of violent demonstrations in one southern city in Puno, a heavily Indigenous and rural region bordering Bolivia.

2023-01-28,"Before he landed in a Tulsa, Okla., jail cell, Chiefsaholic seemed to have an enviable life as a sports fan.
An exuberant, 28-year-old Kansas City Chiefs superfan in a wolf mask, Chiefsaholic attended nearly every game, home and away. N.F.L. broadcasts regularly featured him celebrating in the stands. He shared his adventures with more than 50,000 followers on social media, boasting about bets that would earn him tens of thousands of dollars if he won.
He had a good seat to see his team win the Super Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla., in 2020, and took a selfie with the club’s general manager on the confetti-strewn field. He attended quarterback Patrick Mahomes’s annual fund-raising gala last month in Kansas City, and apparently won the painting that was featured onstage throughout the event.
The price tag must have been steep. A Super Bowl ticket like his would have fetched about $8,500, and an individual ticket to the Mahomes benefit goes for $1,250, to say nothing of travel costs.

“That was the only thing I questioned, how is he doing this,” said Lynn Schmidt, a superfan known as Weirdwolf.
Chiefsaholic had a simple explanation: hard work.
“After graduating KSU in 2016 I was working a warehouse job making $12 an hour,” he wrote on Twitter. “Today I manage multiple warehouses throughout the Midwest region and make an excellent living, and I’m only 28 years old. Hard work pays off and don’t let ANYONE tell you otherwise!”
Police, court and educational records largely tell a different story, and the source of his money remains a mystery. This much is clear, according to the police: On Dec. 16 in Tulsa, he stopped at a bank.
A Story Made for Hollywood?
How did Kansas City’s most ferocious fan become known for his arrest photo instead of just his wolf mask?
Fans started to worry about Chiefsaholic the day after Kansas City defeated the Houston Texans in December. He did not make it to the stadium in Houston. Even more concerning, he did not post about the overtime victory on social media.

“If anyone has seen him or is able to help then please do your thing Chiefs Kingdom,” a concerned fan posted on Reddit. One user replied that there were “literally thousands of people concerned for his safety” and that Chiefsaholic lived a clean lifestyle, making it “unlikely (but not impossible) he ran into trouble with authorities.”
After a few hours of online sleuthing, fans discovered the answer: Xaviar Babudar, as the authorities know Chiefsaholic, was sitting in a jail cell in Tulsa. He was charged with robbery with a firearm after police say he stuck a “C02 pistol” in a teller’s face at a Tulsa credit union. He had been arrested just minutes after the police said they got the call.
There Babudar remains, unable to post his $200,000 bond, and it seems it is where he will be when his beloved team plays the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday for a chance to go to the Super Bowl.
The story of a fan in a wolf costume who posted memes, recorded profane hype videos (“Let’s go, baby! You already know what it is! Chiefs Kingdom!”) and is alleged to have robbed a bank, possibly on his way to the game in Houston, sounds like a made-for-Hollywood romp.

But the truth about Babudar’s private life, pieced together from a trail of records left in courthouses and police stations across the country, is more sobering. His father abandoned the family when Babudar was 10, according to court records, and Babudar was arrested repeatedly in his teens and 20s. He appears to have been homeless for many of those years.
As Chiefsaholic, Babudar reinvented himself in the public eye, in the parking lots and stadiums where it’s easy to be a character instead of a person and outlandishness isn’t just tolerated, but celebrated.
“I thought this was a guy that can carry on the Wolfpack tradition after I’m gone,” said Schmidt, referring to the nickname of boisterous Kansas City fans. “As we can see, that’s not going to happen.”

From jail, he declined a request for an interview unless he was paid.
“I’m currently in the process of selling my story rights,” he wrote. “If The New York Times is interested in making an offer, then please feel free to let me know. Thanks for reaching out!”
A History With the Police
Babudar was first mentioned in court records in 2006, when he was 12. His father, Michael, had filed for bankruptcy in Southern California in 2004, and two years later his mother, Carla, made a filing in the case, asserting that Michael abandoned the family without a word, and that the family’s home had been sold by a bankruptcy trustee. Michael Babudar did not respond to messages seeking comment, and Carla Babudar could not be reached.
Babudar, his mother and his brother appear to have traveled a difficult road.
In 2012, the three were arrested and charged with trying to use fake gift certificates to pay for food at a buffet chain in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. Babudar’s records in the case aren’t available because he was under 18, but his mother and brother pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace. Over the next decade, Babudar was arrested at least a half-dozen times.
In Utah, the police said, Babudar stole spoon holders and snack bags from Target, and another time switched price tags on curtain rods and then attempted to return them for full price. There are still active warrants for his arrest in both cases. He also pleaded guilty to small offenses in Kansas and Missouri. In Champlin, Minn., he was fined $300 for driving without a license.

His license plates said “KCC4EVR.”
Babudar had more than a dozen interactions with police that did not result in arrest.
At least eight times in 2016 and 2017, the police in Overland Park, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City, had contact with Babudar. In most cases he was in a parked car with his mother and brother late at night, and a business owner found their presence suspicious. Other times they were using a hotel lobby or pool even though they were not staying at the hotel.
In police records obtained by The Times, Xaviar is described as a “jumper” who “floats from hotel to hotel.” The Babudars are “known homeless subjects” and “known to do auto burglaries at night,” though none of the Babudars has been convicted in Kansas of auto burglary.
In dozens of court documents and police reports over a decade, the Babudars listed just one address, a drop box in a Mail & Copy Plus office in Overland Park.
Many of Babudar’s encounters with the police happened when he said online that he was attending Kansas State University, a two-hour drive from Kansas City in Manhattan, Kan. The university said it had no record of Babudar’s ever attending.

Sometime in late 2017 and into 2018, Babudar’s fortunes seem to have changed. He worked for nine months at an Amazon warehouse, the company confirmed, and his contact with the police and arrests drastically diminished. Soon, his identity as Chiefsaholic emerged. He first appeared on Instagram in August 2018, posting a meme about the team involving SpongeBob SquarePants. The next month, for the first time, he posted a photograph in the wolf costume.
‘Shaking the Hand of a Legend’
After Babudar’s arrest, Kansas City fans realized he was mostly a stranger to them.
“Nobody really knew the guy behind the mask other than the fact he would show up on game day, act crazy and take lots of pictures with people,” said Matt Black, a superfan known as Almost Andy Reid.
One of the few fans who did seem to know Babudar was John Perkovich, who puts on rubber duck races in his backyard and gives away team gear to other fans. On Twitter, Babudar posted photos playing tennis with Perkovich and a voice mail message Perkovich left him after he won a big bet. But in an email, Perkovich said he socialized with Babudar only a few times and “didn’t even know his last name until it got released with news of the arrest.”
He added, “I was not close to him personally in any aspect.”
While Babudar was not necessarily embraced by the team, he was a familiar presence. Besides being on the field at the Super Bowl and attending Mahomes’s charity gala, he regularly showed up to team events and posed for photographs with players, including offensive tackle Mitchell Schwartz and the star tight end Travis Kelce.
“I might’ve shaken his hand in passing, but didn’t even know I was shaking the hand of a legend,” Kelce told the former N.F.L. player Pat McAfee on Tuesday.

A Big Bet on His Team
Now that Chiefsaholic has been unmasked as Xaviar Babudar, behaviors that were seen as quirky are beginning to make sense. Chiefsaholic frequently posted about driving, not flying, to the team’s away games. And he was well known for never parking in the Arrowhead Stadium parking lot, instead walking to his car miles away. Both make a lot more sense if he was living in his car.
The question remains: How did he afford his life as Chiefsaholic? It seems unlikely he could have funded it with long-shot bets, and it’s not clear where he would have gotten the money to place them.

Soon after Babudar’s arrest, a photo began circulating online of a man wearing a wolf mask while robbing a bank. The thief wasn’t Babudar — the mask is different, the photo was from an Illinois bank robbery in 2016, and the police say Babudar entered the Tulsa credit union wearing a paintball mask — but the image planted an explanation in the minds of many fans to the nagging question of how Babudar afforded his fandom: He robbed banks.

So far, though, there is no evidence that is true. Babudar has been charged with robbing only the single bank in Oklahoma, and Kevin Keller, the head of the criminal division in the Tulsa County District Attorney’s office, said, “We believe this is a one-off in Oklahoma.”
The F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney’s office in Northern Oklahoma declined to comment on whether Babudar would face federal charges or if they are investigating him for other crimes. If the Tulsa case goes to trial, it is not likely to dwell on Babudar’s motive. Prosecutors need only prove that he committed the crime, not why he committed it.
If funding his life as a high-rolling Kansas City fan is what got Babudar jailed in Oklahoma in the first place, then it is his life as a high-rolling fan that might eventually get him out.
Babudar apparently placed an early $5,000 bet on Mahomes to win the Most Valuable Player Award, for which Mahomes is a finalist, and $5,000 on Kansas City winning the Super Bowl. If both bets pay off — and if Babudar is somehow able to collect while in jail — he will win $100,000, and will easily be able to make his bail.
That is, if the betting slips Babudar posted on social media are real.

In the past half-century, 17 percent of the Amazon — an area larger than Texas — has been converted to croplands or cattle pasture. Less forest means less recycled rain, less vapor to cool the air, less of a canopy to shield against sunlight. Under drier, hotter conditions, even the lushest of Amazonian trees will shed leaves to save water, inhibiting photosynthesis — a feedback loop that is only exacerbated by global warming.
According to the Brazilian Earth system scientist Carlos Nobre, if deforestation reaches 20 to 25 percent of the original area, “flying rivers” — rain clouds that recycle the forest’s own moisture five or six times — will weaken enough that a rainforest simply will not be able to survive in most of the Amazon Basin. Instead it will collapse into scrubby savanna, possibly in a matter of decades.
Losing the Amazon, one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, would be catastrophic for the tens of thousands of species that make their home there. What scientists are most concerned about, though, is the potential for this regional, ecological tipping point to produce knock-on effects in the global climate.

Gautam Adani, Asia’s wealthiest man, has lost billions in his battle with a short seller.

Investors appear unconvinced by Adani’s defense
The Adani Group, one of India’s most powerful and prominent industrial conglomerates, is continuing to reel from accusations by a short seller that it had perpetrated stock manipulation and fraud in “the largest con in corporate history.”
The criticism has wiped about $70 billion of market value off Adani’s various listed companies (and whacked the net worth of the group’s founder, Gautam Adani). It has also stoked concerns about the conglomerate’s efforts to raise money, including through a huge stock offering.
The Adani Group has gone on offense, issuing a 413-page rebuttal to the fraud accusations by Hindenburg Research, a small New York-based firm run by Nathan Anderson. The Adani Group called Hindenburg’s report baseless and said the investment firm’s shorting of Adani-related companies’ overseas-traded bonds and derivatives was securities fraud. For good measure, the company said Hindenburg’s conduct amounted to a “calculated attack on India.”
Hindenburg, which made a name for itself taking on S.P.A.C.s and crypto firms, said it stands by its report, adding “fraud cannot be obfuscated by nationalism.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Investors seem to be siding with Hindenburg, for now. Shares of several listed Adani companies, including Adani Total Gas and Adani Green Energy, were down 20 percent this morning, though its flagship Adani Enterprises was up 5 percent.
A bigger concern is that the Adani Group is falling short of its goal of raising $2.5 billion through a stock offering: Investors have bid on just a fraction of the 45.5 million shares on offer, according to stock exchange data. “The issue is not even at the halfway mark, and tomorrow is the closing date,” Saurabh Jain, an equity analyst with SMC Global Securities in Delhi, told DealBook. “This will be a big 24 hours.”
Image
Adani Group’s connections  to the Indian government are also under scrutiny. Gautam Adani has close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and his empire has won a number of government concessions in recent years that helped it expand into the media, energy and cement sectors. Last summer, Mr. Adani overtook Mukesh Ambani to become India’s wealthiest man.
But it’s unclear if those connections will help: Modi and his government have stayed out of the fight so far. And it’s not certain if or how Indian regulators could intervene, as Hindenburg is shorting the Adani Group’s non-Indian securities.

The battle is affecting investor confidence in India. The Nifty 50 index, which includes the country’s largest companies — including Adani Enterprises — is down 2.5 percent over the past week, after having outperformed the S&P 500 last year.
“There’s a huge amount of volatility in the Indian markets,” Mr. Jain said of the recent market sell-off, adding that the decline has derailed a January stock rally.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Nissan and Renault reshape their alliance. The carmakers said on Monday that they were rebalancing their relationship so that each would own a 15 percent stake in the other; Renault currently owns 43 percent of Nissan, far more than the Japanese company’s share of its French ally. The revamped partnership could lead to increased cooperation in developing electric vehicles.
The S.E.C. is reportedly looking into Elon Musk’s role in Tesla’s self-driving claims. The regulator is examining whether the carmaker’s chief executive inappropriately made forward-looking statements about the company’s technology, according to Bloomberg. The inquiry is part of a broader look at what Tesla has said about self-driving cars, a key part of its business strategy.
TikTok’s C.E.O. will testify before Congress. Shou Chew will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on March 23 as the sole witness at a hearing focused on the Chinese-owned video app. It’s an opportunity for a newly Republican-led House to grill Chew about TikTok over data security concerns.
Unilever taps a board member as its new C.E.O. The British consumer giant hired Hein Schumacher, who is also the head of a Dutch dairy cooperative, as its chief executive. The hiring of Schumacher, who began his career at Unilever, had the support of Nelson Peltz’s Trian, which had sought to shake up the conglomerate.

China Inc. gets a New Year’s boost
Mainland China’s stock exchanges officially entered a bull market on the first day of trading after the weeklong pause for the Lunar New Year, as investors were heartened by signs that the country’s economy was recovering after three years of Beijing’s zero-Covid social restrictions.

Chinese consumers appear to be spending again. Official data showed that spending on travel and entertainment, including bookings for theater tickets and hotels, was up compared with previous years, according to Bloomberg. Outbound air travel more than quadrupled year-on-year as well, suggesting that high-spending Chinese tourists will flock abroad once more.
All that has Western companies optimistic about an economic rebound.
Will China finally let consumers lead its economy? Over the weekend, Li Keqiang, China’s premier, said the government planned to make consumer spending the “main driving force” of China’s economy. But Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, said it was unclear if the government was prepared to limit the state’s role in the economy: “Beijing wants to boost the role of consumption without absorbing any of the costs of such a major structural adjustment, but that isn’t likely to be an option,” he tweeted.
Meanwhile, tensions with the West are still growing. Among the latest signs:
Japan and the Netherlands agreed last week to U.S. demands to impose restrictions on exporting advanced chip-making equipment to China. Noah Barkin, an expert on Europe-China relations at the Rhodium Group consultancy, told DealBook that the move showed more international alignment with Washington’s approach to China: “This is one more economic challenge for Beijing to overcome, on top of the property crisis, high household debt levels and a shrinking population,” he added.
A four-star U.S. Air Force general warned in an internal memo that America could be at war with China by 2025, according to NBC News. (A Pentagon representative told NBC News, “These comments are not representative of the department’s view on China.”)

Inside the purported turning of an F.B.I. agent
The arrest of Charles McGonigal, a former senior F.B.I. official, on charges of helping a Russian oligarch sent shock waves through the national-security community.
Mr. McGonigal may have been turned by the aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska — as reported by The Times and Insider — for work that violated U.S. sanctions. Prosecutors portrayed the case as the tale of a U.S. investigator being corrupted by someone he had investigated. (A representative for Mr. Deripaska denied to The Times that the billionaire had ever hired Mr. McGonigal; a lawyer for Mr. McGonigal declined to comment.)
The U.S. had sought to recruit Mr. Deripaska as an informant. The billionaire had spent years trying to buy respectability in the West, and had even cooperated with the U.S., including spending $25 million of his own money trying to rescue an F.B.I. agent who had been captured in Iran.
He was known to be close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia (though Mr. Deripaska’s representative denies this) and to have ties to organized crime, and gained heightened attention from Washington in 2016 when it emerged that he had employed the onetime Trump adviser Paul Manafort.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. McGonigal was well-placed to help. Until his retirement in 2018, he ran the counterintelligence bureau of the F.B.I.’s New York office — and investigated Russian oligarchs. It isn’t clear how he entered Deripaska’s orbit, but prosecutors say Mr. McGonigal, while still employed by the F.B.I., was introduced to an employee of the Russian in 2018.
According to the charging documents, Mr. McGonigal was asked to help the daughter of the Deripaska employee, known in the indictment as Agent-1, get an internship at the New York Police Department. (Insider reports that the daughter never became an intern.) After Mr. McGonigal retired, he introduced Agent-1 to an international law firm to help get the sanctions against Mr. Deripaska lifted, and signed on as a consultant and investigator. He met with Mr. Deripaska in London and Vienna, and later was in talks to work directly for the Russian oligarch.
“Every day, those brokers come in here. They get their bagels, sandwiches, doughnuts, coffee, cigarettes … and every day, they’re out there on the sidewalk, pushing and shoving on a door that is clearly marked ‘pull.’ ”

A dramatic fall in value for Stripe, the payment processing start-up.

Dado Ruvic/Reuters
A giant start-up takes a hit to raise cash
Stripe, one of Silicon Valley’s biggest private start-ups, plans to raise roughly $2.5 billion, led by Josh Kushner’s Thrive Capital, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and Maureen Farrell report in The Times. The investment would give Stripe financial breathing room at a time when start-ups are struggling to raise money.
But the deal would come at a cost: It will value Stripe, which reportedly lost money last year, at $55 billion to $60 billion, down sharply from just a few years ago. It’s perhaps the biggest sign yet that start-ups will have to accept some trade-offs to raise money while the  markets remain largely shut to new entrants.
Stripe has fallen from the $95 billion it was valued at in 2021, as part of a $600 million fund-raising round. Then, the company — whose payment processing technology is used by customers including Amazon and Peloton — was riding high from the pandemic-driven surge in e-commerce and digital services, along with an investment boom spurred by near-zero interest rates that led to eye-popping valuations.
But as interest rates have risen and a slowing economy has hurt publicly traded tech companies, Stripe and other start-ups have seen their fortunes fall. The company, which has announced layoffs and cost cuts in recent weeks, has lowered the internal stock price used to calculate stock option grants.
Stripe faced some pressure to raise money soon. The investment led by Thrive, an existing investor, would be used not to fund operations but to pay tax liabilities associated with employee stock grants and, just as importantly, let employees sell their shares — which has grown in importance as the market for new listings remains largely inhospitable. (How times have changed: At this time in 2021, seven tech companies had raised about $7 billion via I.P.O.s, according to Dealogic; no tech companies have gone public this year.)
Still, Stripe is exploring whether to go public within the next 12 months: It has hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase as advisers, and is considering options like a direct listing.

Recent signs of slowing inflation were “early stage,” Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said.

1. The Fed slowed its rate increase but said that ongoing jumps were warranted.
Policymakers raised rates by a quarter of a point today, the smallest increase since March 2022 when the central bank began its aggressive campaign to tame rising prices. But officials said it was far too early to declare victory in their campaign against inflation.
“We’re talking about a couple more rate hikes,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said. He added, “I just don’t see us cutting rates this year.”

On Wall Street, analysts are optimistic that the Fed’s rate increases will end sooner rather than later. For the rest of us, the continued increases have two immediate effects: Savers earn higher yields and borrowers pay more.

The College Board purged the names of several Black writers and scholars associated with critical race theory, the queer experience and Black feminism. It also made the study of contemporary topics, like Black Lives Matter, optional. And it added something new: “Black conservatism” is now available as an idea for a research project.
The changes came after DeSantis, a Republican who is expected to run for president, announced he would ban the curriculum in his state, citing the draft version that leaked online. The College Board said that the changes were all made for pedagogical reasons, not to bow to political pressure.

3. Russia may be mounting a new onslaught on Ukraine.
Russia has stepped up artillery attacks to a rate not seen since September and dispatched tens of thousands of troops to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine described these as the opening moves of a new Russian offensive to capture territory in the country’s east.

“I think it has started,” Zelensky said.
Ukrainian intelligence estimates that Russia now has more than 320,000 soldiers in the country — roughly twice the size of Moscow’s initial invasion force. Russia’s plans are a matter of speculation, but a Ukrainian official said he expected the fighting to intensify in February and March.

5. An F.B.I. team tried to game out the worst possible outcomes of a disputed 2020 election. They never envisioned what transpired on Jan. 6, 2021.
The bureau was blinded by a narrow focus on “lone wolf” offenders and harbored a misguided belief that the threat from the far left was as great as that from the far right. It was unprepared to prevent the violent mob that mobilized in support of Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the election, new congressional documents show.

Agents also ignored warning signs flashing on social media and relied on confidential sources who failed to sound the alarm. The documents are just the latest example of how the F.B.I. was unable to predict the chaos that erupted on Jan. 6.

6. Vaccine makers kept $1.4 billion in prepayments for canceled Covid shots meant for the world’s poor.
As global demand for Covid vaccines dries up, the program responsible for vaccinating the world’s poor has been urgently negotiating to try to get out of its deals with pharmaceutical companies for shots it no longer needs.
But drug companies have so far declined to refund $1.4 billion in advance payments for the now-canceled doses, according to confidential documents obtained by The Times. Under the contracts, manufacturers are not required to refund the prepayments, though some have still reached settlements to return partial amounts. The money the vaccine manufacturers have kept, one expert said, could fund other large global health programs.

7. Tom Brady said he was retiring — for real this time.
Brady, the 45-year-old quarterback widely regarded as the greatest player in N.F.L. history, won seven Super Bowls over 23 seasons and broke virtually every career passing record.
In a video he posted to social media this morning, Brady told his fans, “I’m retiring. For good.” It was an apparent nod to a retirement announcement he made last year, which he reversed less than six weeks later. Brady, who is set to join Fox Sports as an analyst, was the oldest active player in the N.F.L. this season, but still led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to an NFC South title.

8. Dissecting Elon Musk’s tweets.
In order to assess how Twitter may evolve under Musk’s watch, The Times reviewed nearly 20,000 of his public tweets and the relatively small number of users that he follows.
Of the 178 accounts that Musk follows, most are related to his businesses. The list is also heavily male: Only two dozen accounts that are not institutional or organizational belong to women. He has liberally posted memes, rants and combative responses, and about topics that are popular among political fringes. And for someone who has said he is fighting for free speech, Musk’s feed is often an echo chamber.

10. And finally, missing monkeys.
Two emperor tamarin monkeys were taken from the Dallas Zoo this week and found yesterday inside a closet at a home about 15 miles south of the zoo. The police said that they located the monkeys after receiving a tip, but that “the home was empty” when they arrived and so they made no arrests in the case.
The monkeys — small animals with mustachelike whiskers native to parts of the Amazon — were only the latest bizarre incident involving breached enclosures at the zoo. Others involved a missing clouded leopard that was recovered after a suspicious tear was discovered in the animal’s enclosure, and an endangered vulture that died under unusual circumstances.

Economic conditions are challenging, Tim Cook, Apple’s C.E.O., warns.
Credit...
Stephen Lam/Reuters
A new era of austerity
Shares in tech companies are in retreat after investors got sobering news on Thursday about three of the industry’s giants — Alphabet, Amazon and Apple — including slowing demand for everything from iPhones to digital ads to cloud services.
“You’re hearing that from, I would think, everybody,” Tim Cook of Apple said of the challenging environment on CNBC. That outlook is largely responsible for Nasdaq 100 futures being down 1.4 percent this morning, eroding Thursday’s big tech stock gains after investors hoped that the Facebook parent Meta had shown tech how to operate in leaner times.
Plenty of headwinds are hitting the tech sector. Central bankers this week reiterated that they’re not done raising interest rates (even if market participants don’t fully believe it). Together with a slowing economy, that has led companies and consumers alike to spend less — a move toward austerity that tech companies have now embraced, after years of rocketing head counts and cushy perks to retain employees.
All three tech titans that reported earnings on Thursday made sure to talk about cost cuts, after Meta added roughly $100 billion in market value in the wake of an earnings report in which its C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, touted 2023 as a “year of efficiency.”

Here are the big takeaways from Thursday’s earnings reports:
Alphabet disclosed its fourth consecutive decline in profit, as ad sales at YouTube fell below $8 billion, falling short of analyst forecasts. On expense-cutting efforts, its C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, said: “I see this as an important journey to re-engineer the company’s cost base in a durable way.”
Amazon said its cloud business had slowed, as had its e-commerce operations. In his first earnings call with analysts since taking over as C.E.O., Andy Jassy said “there is a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient.”
Apple reported its worst holiday season since 2018, in large part because of Covid lockdowns that disrupted its largest iPhone factory in China. The company emphasized its efforts to spend less: “We’re doing a lot of work around costs,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s C.F.O. “That is paying off.”
Meanwhile, doubts are growing about the durability of January’s market rally. Michael Hartnett, Bank of America’s chief investment strategist, warned clients this morning that while investors are snapping up risky assets like cryptocurrencies and high-yield bonds, he sees a looming “bear risk” for stocks as recession appears likely later this year.
And Michael Burry, the investor whose bet against the housing market was memorably chronicled in “The Big Short,” tweeted one word on Wednesday — “Sell” — and then deleted his account.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Job growth has cooled, economists forecast. Investors will be closely watching Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report, scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern. The consensus estimate is that 187,000 new jobs were created last month. Investors will also be watching wage data for signs of the labor market’s effect on inflation.
A top economic aide to President Biden will step down. Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council and an architect of many of Biden’s sweeping economic policies, will leave the White House this month. His potential successors include Lael Brainard, the Fed’s vice chair, and Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary.

A Democratic lawmaker calls on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first member of Congress to urge an immediate ban of the Chinese-owned video app from leading smartphone platforms, calling TikTok “an unacceptable threat to the national security of the United States.” It’s the latest sign of pressure on TikTok from all corners in Washington.
A former Goldman Sachs president is reportedly in talks to become Carlyle’s next chief. Harvey Schwartz, who lost the race to become Goldman’s C.E.O. to David Solomon, is a top candidate to lead the private equity giant, according to Semafor. Carlyle has been looking for a permanent C.E.O. since August, when Kewsong Lee resigned following a power struggle with the firm’s founders.

Nordstrom meets a meme-stock activist
Shares in Nordstrom jumped 30 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday following a report by The Wall Street Journal that the activist investor Ryan Cohen had taken a significant stake in the department store chain. (DealBook has confirmed his investment.)
Mr. Cohen has shaken up companies before, having focused on so-called meme-stock companies like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond, bringing with him flurries of supportive online traders. But it’s unclear how Nordstrom will respond to its newest gadfly.

Mr. Cohen hasn’t made many demands yet. He has asked Nordstrom to replace at least some of its board; one clear target is Mark Tritton, whose compensation as C.E.O. of Bed Bath & Beyond was a target of his criticism. But it’s not clear at the moment what Cohen thinks Nordstrom should do to better navigate the challenging environment for clothing retailers.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
His activism history doesn’t give Nordstrom much to go on. While investors usually know what to expect when veteran activist shareholders like Elliott Management target a company, Mr. Cohen has less of an obvious playbook:
Though he became chairman of GameStop and changed up its board and management team, some analysts have said he hasn’t fundamentally improved the video game retailer’s operations.
At Bed Bath & Beyond, Cohen called for a board revamp and urged the sale of the retailer’s Buy Buy Baby subsidiary — but the latter hasn’t happened. He has since sold off his stake, and Bed Bath & Beyond is now likely to file for bankruptcy.
Nordstrom has some protections, including a founding family that owns about 30 percent of its stock. For now, the company is striking a cordial tone: “While Mr. Cohen hasn’t sought any discussions with us in several years, we are open to hearing his views, as we do with all Nordstrom shareholders,” a company representative said in a statement.
Adani gets some breathing room
Investors again dumped shares this morning in some companies tied to the Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, as his business empire has shed over $100 billion in market value since an American short seller accused its leaders of market manipulation and fraud.
Nevertheless, some good news for the Adani Group has emerged — even if the long-term prospects for the conglomerate remain cloudy.

The positive developments: The ratings agency Fitch said it had no immediate plans to downgrade the bonds of the Adani companies it follows; that led to a modest rally in those notes. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have reportedly told some clients that Adani-related debt could still be a good investment. And the Adani Group said it was in talks to prepay some of its outstanding loans to restore confidence in its finances.
All this may come as a relief to Adani investors, a group that’s surprisingly global. BlackRock and TIAA are among those that own Adani bonds; Total, the French energy giant, told investors that it has about $3.1 billion worth of stakes in Adani Group companies.
Not everything is looking up, however. S&P Dow Jones said on Friday that it was removing the flagship Adani Enterprises from its sustainability index, citing the allegations by the short seller, Hindenburg Research. Meanwhile, shares of Adani Green Energy and Adani Total Gas again fell sharply on Friday, and Adani Enterprises’ stock finished down 2.2 percent on the day.
And while the credit ratings agency Moody’s, like Fitch, didn’t downgrade any Adani debt, it warned that further stock slides in Adani Group companies could hurt their ability to raise money over the next one to two years.

The hurried rollout of ChatGPT
ChatGPT has become one of the biggest breakout technologies in years, with its ability to write poems (and, somewhat controversially, news reports), generate code and more having captured the popular imagination. It has stoked ever-growing enthusiasm about the possibilities of A.I.: Bill Gates recently told Forbes, “This is every bit as important as the PC, as the internet.”
But ChatGPT’s public debut wasn’t part of an intricately planned rollout by its parent company, OpenAI. Instead, the start-up’s employees were surprised when its leaders directed them to release a public version of their chatbot technology in two weeks, according to The Times’s Kevin Roose in his latest column:
Some were worried that rival companies might upstage them by releasing their own A.I. chatbots before GPT-4, according to the people with knowledge of OpenAI. And putting something out quickly using an old model, they reasoned, could help them collect feedback to improve the new one.
So they decided to dust off and update an unreleased chatbot that used a souped-up version of GPT-3, the company’s previous language model, which came out in 2020.
Thirteen days later, ChatGPT was born.
The results are hard to argue with. ChatGPT has more than 30 million users and gets roughly five million visits a day, Roose writes, citing two sources. That makes it one of the fastest-growing software products in recent memory.

2023-02-06,"Marisa Shuman’s computer science class at the Young Women’s Leadership School of the Bronx began as usual on a recent January morning.
Just after 11:30, energetic 11th and 12th graders bounded into the classroom, settled down at communal study tables and pulled out their laptops. Then they turned to the front of the room, eyeing a whiteboard where Ms. Shuman had posted a question on wearable technology, the topic of that day’s class.
For the first time in her decade-long teaching career, Ms. Shuman had not written any of the lesson plan. She had generated the class material using ChatGPT, a new chatbot that relies on artificial intelligence to deliver written responses to questions in clear prose. Ms. Shuman was using the algorithm-generated lesson to examine the chatbot’s potential usefulness and pitfalls with her students.
“I don’t care if you learn anything about wearable technology today,” Ms. Shuman said to her students. “We are evaluating ChatGPT. Your goal is to identify whether the lesson is effective or ineffective.”

Across the United States, universities and school districts are scrambling to get a handle on new chatbots that can generate humanlike texts and images. But while many are rushing to ban ChatGPT to try to prevent its use as a cheating aid, teachers like Ms. Shuman are leveraging the innovations to spur more critical classroom thinking. They are encouraging their students to question the hype around rapidly evolving artificial intelligence tools and consider the technologies’ potential side effects.
The aim, these educators say, is to train the next generation of technology creators and consumers in “critical computing.” That is an analytical approach in which understanding how to critique computer algorithms is as important as — or more important than — knowing how to program computers."
2023-02-07,"Bed Bath & Beyond’s plan to use a public stock offering as a way to raise more than $1 billion and avoid bankruptcy will be backed by the investment firm Hudson Bay Capital Management, two people familiar with the situation said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the terms of the deal have not been made public.
Bed Bath & Beyond disclosed the deal on Monday without naming Hudson Bay. It hopes that raising enough cash will restore the confidence of suppliers, preserve jobs and allow the company to pursue a turnaround plan it announced in August.
The retailer said on Tuesday that it had already underwritten the initial $225 million worth of shares it was selling. It plans to sell an additional $800 million over time, assuming “certain conditions are met.” The company did not disclose what those conditions were.
Hudson Bay, though, has essentially agreed to buy the stock, assuming Bed Bath & Beyond sells the additional shares.

Hudson Bay is a multibillion-dollar fund based in Greenwich, Conn. It often acts as a mergers specialist, either betting passively on whether company deals go through or fall apart or, at other times, pushing for such moves.
The firm is likely looking to take advantage of Bed Bath & Beyond’s rising share price, with hopes of selling when it goes even higher. Retail investors helped drive the price up nearly 100 percent on Monday, before Bed Bath & Beyond announced its plan to offer stock. Shares fell nearly 50 percent in trading on Tuesday, to around $3.
“This transformative transaction will provide runway to execute our turnaround plan,” Sue Gove, Bed Bath & Beyond’s chief executive, said in a statement. “As we make important strategic and operational changes, we will continue to take disciplined steps to enhance our cost base and improve our financial position.”
A spokesperson for Hudson Bay did not respond to request for comment. Bed Bath & Beyond did not respond to a request for additional comment on the transaction. The deal between the hedge fund and the retailer was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Some analysts doubt whether the deal will be enough to help the struggling home goods retailer.
“The fundamental story for Bed Bath & Beyond is so broken at this point,” David Silverman, retail analyst at Fitch Ratings, said. “I don’t know that a short-term cash infusion that could buy them a few months, a couple of quarters, is going to change their fate.”

The deal with Hudson Bay came together within the past several weeks, the two people familiar with the matter said. Late last month, JPMorgan Chase, which helped give Bed Bath & Beyond a lifeline this summer by expanding its credit line, froze the retailer’s credit accounts after notifying it that it was in breach of the terms of its debt. As Bed Bath & Beyond raced to find cash to pay its debts, tensions built over the amount information it was sharing with its banks and other creditors and how quickly it was relaying it to them, the people said.

The retailer’s lenders had dealt with a great deal of turbulence over the past few months. In early September, weeks after Bed Bath & Beyond secured rescue financing from JPMorgan and the investment firm Sixth Street, the company’s chief financial officer died in what was ruled a suicide. Industry executives have questioned whether the retailer had the right management in place to weather its challenges.
On Monday, Bed Bath & Beyond said Holly Etlin had been hired as the interim chief financial officer. Ms. Etlin has experience with restructurings and company turnarounds.
Rising interest rates have also made lenders warier of plowing more money into distressed companies like Bed Bath & Beyond. But equity may prove to be a new alternative.
Bed Bath & Beyond’s move echoes what appears to be a new playbook for distressed retailers. Another indebted company favored by meme traders, AMC Entertainment, sold investors preferred shares in August after common shareholders balked at its efforts to issue more stock, which dilutes the value of shares that are already held. Both sets of AMC shares have remained volatile. In 2020, Hertz tried to sell shares after filing for bankruptcy, but the Securities and Exchange Commission squashed those efforts.

“For those who are in this situation, for those who are desperate, this will be one instrument that they can use,” said Douglas Chia, the head of Soundboard Governance, a corporate governance consultancy. “Every couple years there’s a new instrument that investment bankers come up with, and it’s creative and it becomes the flavor of the month and everyone starts to use that. This could be the same thing.”
The question for Bed Bath & Beyond and the roughly 30,000 people it employed as of last February is whether it will be enough. Even if this financing goes through, the company faces the same challenges that have plagued it the past couple of months. The retailer is contending with low inventory in its stores as vendors hold back on shipping items because of worries about its finances. It also has a less sophisticated e-commerce operation than many of its competitors and a dwindling customer base.
The stock offering “by itself doesn’t change the business model or any of those tough decisions that they need to make,” said Patrick Collins, a partner who works on bankruptcies and restructurings at the law firm Farrell Fritz.
The deal could give Bed Bath & Beyond only a few more quarters of financial runway, said Seth Basham, a retail analyst at the investment firm Wedbush Capital.
The company is ramping up the number of stores it’s closing to more than 400, including Harmon stores. That’s a significant chunk of the 950 stores that it had when the closings began in August.

Sales keep sliding as well. Bed Bath & Beyond has said it expects comparable sales in the first quarter to decline 30 to 40 percent from a year earlier, but expects to see quarterly sales improving afterward.
It projects that its ability to have goods in stock will return to normal levels by the important back-to-college shopping season.
Not everyone is convinced.
“It is very difficult to see where they could be able to reverse those trends quickly, particularly given we’re in a somewhat challenging environment for retail goods,” Fitch’s Mr. Silverman said. “You’ve got competitors like Target, Amazon, Walmart and low- and mid-tier department stores that aren’t relinquishing market share.”"
2023-02-08,"About 4.9 million bottles of the multipurpose cleaning product Fabuloso have been recalled because they may contain bacteria that can cause a serious infection in people with weakened immune systems and others with health risks, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Wednesday.
The recalled products were sold online through Amazon and other websites as well as in brick-and-mortar stores including Dollar General, Family Dollar, Walmart and Home Depot from December 2022 through January. Several sizes of Fabuloso were recalled in scents including lavender, lemon and ocean.
Fabuloso’s manufacturer, Colgate-Palmolive, said in a statement that a preservative had not been added “at the intended levels” during the manufacturing process and that the “inadequate” amount of the preservative might have allowed bacteria to grow.
The recalled products may include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens, bacteria that can enter the body through inhalation, the eyes or a break in the skin. The recall notice said that people with healthy immune systems were not usually affected by the bacteria, but people with weakened immune systems, external medical devices or underlying lung conditions could contract a serious infection if exposed to it.

The commission said that no incidents or injuries had been reported from the recalled product.
Colgate-Palmolive advised people to stop using the recalled cleaners and not to empty the bottles before throwing them away. About 3.9 million of the recalled bottles had not been sold, Colgate-Palmolive said. The recall also included about 56,000 bottles of the cleaner sold in Canada.
People who purchased the recalled bottles should contact Colgate-Palmolive for a refund or for a free replacement product. “We remain committed to maintaining the highest level of product quality and have taken action to help ensure we live up to those standards,” the company said.
The recall did not include bottles of Fabuloso antibacterial cleaner or other Fabuloso products. The recalled and unaffected products are listed online.
Fabuloso debuted in Venezuela in the 1980s, then gained popularity in Mexico before it was introduced in the United States in 1996, and became the cleaner of choice for many Latino households.

Fabuloso is the latest cleaning brand to recall products because they may contain bacteria. About 37 million bottles of scented Pine-Sol were recalled in October, and about eight million bottles of the Laundress brand products were recalled in December."
2023-02-09,"Alex Gable spent recent weeks in the bleary-eyed haze of new parenthood. His son was born in November and Mr. Gable powered down his laptop, deleted Slack from his phone and focused on caring for his wife while making the most of the four precious hours a day that their baby was awake — there was tummy time and time spent ogling little drawings of snowflakes.
Then on Jan. 18, Mr. Gable got an early morning notification for an all-hands meeting at Coda, the software company where he worked as a data scientist. Four hours later Mr. Gable, 30, found himself having to deliver the news to his wife: He had been laid off while on paternity leave — months after choosing the company for its generous paternity leave policy and openness toward work-life balance.
“It’s like an earthquake,” he said. “It’s the weight of ‘What am I going to bring him up with? How is his first year going to go? How are you going to make ends meet?’”
Workers across the tech and media industries are experiencing a period of immense whiplash. After lavishing their employees with perks, in a tight labor market and a war for talent, companies have turned to mass job cuts, including Alphabet, which laid off 6 percent of its workers last month, and Microsoft, which cut nearly 5 percent.

These are the same companies that spent recent years expanding benefits in one area in particular: paid parental leave and caregiver benefits, which fill in the gaps for white-collar workers in a country where the federal government does not require employers to offer paid parental leave. Which means that working parents have felt the turbulence of mass layoffs in an especially visceral way.
Now some are spending their early weeks of parenthood adjusting to life without a job. LinkedIn and Twitter have been filled with accounts of workers being laid off while on parental leave or even, in at least two instances, while delivering a baby. That comes with a mental health toll — as so many laid-off workers across different backgrounds have experienced, including those who are immigrants with visas tied to employment.
Employees across tech have felt that their companies engaged in a bait and switch, after selling not just a job but a lifestyle, with child care, mental health support and plentiful paid time off. For new parents, generous leave was part of the draw. Many had assumed that their parental leave came with some legal protection, and were distraught to learn they were caught up in mass job cuts. Being on parental leave does not protect someone from mass layoffs unrelated to their leave.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
America has no federal paid-family-leave policy. About 23 percent of private employees have paid maternity leave, according to September 2022 data from the career site Zippia. More than 90 percent of women take the full amount of leave offered, compared with about two-thirds of men, according to a survey by the Boston College Center for Work and Family.
But in the last five years, companies scaled up family-friendly benefits for some workers in what human resources experts called the “golden age” of corporate benefits. A study from Mercer found that 54 percent of large companies covered in vitro fertilization in 2022, compared with 36 percent in 2015, and 19 percent covered egg freezing compared with 6 percent in 2015.

Tech companies were especially generous on parental leave compared with other industries. Google increased its parental leave to 24 weeks from 18 in 2021, Meta offers parents 20 weeks, and Microsoft gave 20 weeks for birthing parents and 12 weeks for nonbirthing parents. California, too, increased parental leave benefits to eight weeks from six. ZipRecruiter found that 849 out of 100,000 job postings offered paid parental leave in 2022, up from 95 out of 100,000 in 2017.

This expansion of family-friendly benefits was partly a bid for female talent, as historically male-dominated workplaces made commitments to bringing in more women. It also reflected a cultural shift, as a new generation of workers, across genders, made it clear they wanted the flexibility to play an active role in child care, according to Joan Williams, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.
“There’s a sizable portion of young men who would be bent out of shape if they couldn’t take family leave,” Ms. Williams said. “Tech companies realized they could try to steal talent by having the best set of family leave policies around.”
With these new perks also came an uptick in the share of men taking paternity leave. In 2011, fewer than 5 percent of new fathers took more than two weeks of paternity leave. Today, 90 percent of men take more than seven weeks of leave if they are offered eight weeks, according to the Boston College Center for Work and Family. Some managers started proactively asking male workers how they planned to use their leave time, leaving behind the culture of assuming that fathers would take off only a few days.

People on parental leave typically have no special legal protection when it comes to mass layoffs. Many workers have a legal right to take parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law, or similar state laws. But being on leave, including for disability, doesn’t usually protect people from job cuts that would have happened anyway.
“It’s jarring because people do view it as job-protected leave without understanding that there are limits on the protection,” said Megan Bisk, head of the employment law practice at Ropes & Gray. “Many people view it as a time when they’re not in a position to be job searching.”
If workers were laid off because they were on parental leave, that would be illegal — but it would be difficult to prove, Ms. Bisk explained, because the criteria companies use for layoffs aren’t disclosed to laid-off workers.
Emily St. James, 42, who was a senior correspondent at Vox, had been up late feeding her newborn the day before Vox Media announced its mass layoffs last month, so she slept in until 9 a.m. on the West Coast. She woke up to a text from Vox’s publisher, then checked her email and saw that she had been laid off. Ms. St. James’s termination date was set as the last day of her maternity leave, which is in late March, and she will get 24 weeks of severance pay beyond that.
“When it happened I think my wife said, ‘Well, isn’t that illegal?’” Ms. St. James recalled. “This has underscored for me the degree to which the social safety net for people who are new parents is very frayed.”

Vox declined to comment for this article.
The lack of legal guidelines has resulted in a patchwork of policies among companies. For those laid off while on parental leave, Amazon is offering to pay out the remainder of their time off, as well as severance packages. Meta and Google, on the other hand, aren’t paying for any remaining parental leave but are offering all employees several months of pay and additional severance.
Several workers who were laid off while on parental leave declined to speak for this article, citing fears of retribution because their severance packages are tied to agreements that they won’t speak to the media.
Niki Woodall, who was an engineering leadership recruiter at one of the world’s largest tech companies, agreed to share her experience without naming her employer. She had been at the company for five years when she told her bosses that she planned to take six months of maternity leave starting last summer. Their family-friendly attitude gave her the confidence to completely unplug from work. She said she left without thinking: “My job is at stake.”
A month before she was set to return, she received a personal email letting her know that her job was being eliminated. She turned to her 4-month-old daughter, who was sitting beside the family cat, Wesa, and said, “Mommy lost her job.”
“There’s a big misperception that you can’t be let go during maternity leave,” said Ms. Woodall, 39. She was disappointed to lose her job but not surprised because the layoffs hit many fellow recruiters.

Other parents who lost their jobs said they wondered whether their absence from the office contributed to executives’ deciding their position was redundant.
Some parental leave experts worry that fear of future layoffs could deter new fathers from taking their leave. As Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work and Family, put it: “This will have a sobering effect.”
Mr. Gable had a previous layoff experience, from Zillow, in 2021 — at the height of the pandemic’s white hot job market. The career opportunities felt endless — including many at companies with generous policies toward parents. He chose Coda because he sensed that managers there were supportive of workers taking time for their families. As he prepares to apply for tech jobs yet again, his options feel far more limited.
“Its weird to have that pulled out from under you,” he said. “The market conditions are basically the opposite right now.”"
2023-02-10,"A friend of a friend was heading back to New York on the train. He pulled out his phone and opened the Grindr app. He started chatting with a guy who, it turned out, was also on the train: the conductor. Shouldn’t you be focused on the road? he texted, flirtatiously. Last fall, a different friend matched on Tinder with the great-grandson of Eva Perón’s bodyguard. Another friend, who insists any app with a chat function can be a dating app, hooked up with the driver dispatched to bring him socks he ordered online after some DMing about delivery instructions got steamy. After he ghosted the guy, packages marked delivered never arrived.
All these stories sounded like the beginnings of novels — romance, historical fiction, revenge thriller — so much so that I wondered why more writers weren’t taking greater advantage of this material, especially since for most people I know, dating now means one thing: going on the apps. As the narrator of Kate Folk’s “Out There,” the title story of her 2022 collection, jokes, putting herself “out there” ironically means staying in and downloading Tinder and Bumble: “I resolved to pass judgment on several hundred men per day,” she declares.
Perhaps the relative dearth of dating apps in contemporary fiction is because meeting online has often been seen as a lackluster story, not on the page but in life. When the narrator of Lauren Oyler’s “Fake Accounts” (2021) considers making a profile on a dating app, she mourns the meet-cutes of the predigital era: “Would it not be humiliating to go from the great story of falling in love with my Berlin pub crawl tour guide to saying, ‘We met on Tinder.’” Yet for writers, Oyler included, who have chosen to incorporate into their plots the apps and algorithms that now commingle with our most primal urges, the results have been, well — disruptive. As in life, dating apps in fiction have provided authors with new, bold stories to tell about human connection and intimacy, in which desire can suddenly feel as boundless as the internet itself.
For some writers, online dating enables characters to break free from traditional narratives about how people should meet, wherein heterosexuality is treated as a default, the obvious and only story. “Anne of Cleaves,” a story from Brandon Taylor’s collection “Filthy Animals” (2021), opens with a first date that is also the first meeting of Marta and Sigrid, an encounter initiated online. After breaking up with her boyfriend, Peter, Marta created a profile on a dating site; under the category of “interested in,” she put “women and not men.” Peter was part of her social group in college, a setting that made their coming together seem preordained: “They saw each other so much that it had seemed natural that they should date, and when he asked her to the movies, she’d said OK, all right, sounds good.” Though dating apps were once seen as facilitating connection through artificial means, here Taylor shows how they have also allowed people to question these terms, to replace what “seemed natural” with what they actually feel.

As in life, dating apps in fiction have provided authors with new, bold stories to tell about human connection and intimacy.
For other writers, dating apps make possible encounters among characters who might not otherwise come into contact by virtue of differences in age, race or class. Theirs are provocative stories of desire and the limited social worlds we have confined it to. In Sarah Thankam Mathews’s novel “All This Could Be Different” (2022), a recent college grad referred to as “S” (her profile name on the app) is taken aback when her date, a woman raised by a struggling single mom, shares a detail about her upbringing. “When I was a very little kid,” the woman confides, her mother “was stripping to make rent, and from some hazy memories I suspect she did a lotta blow.” She interrupts herself as she sees S’s look of surprise: “Wow, your face right now, I want to take a picture of it.” Sally Rooney’s latest novel, “Beautiful World, Where Are You” (2021), likewise revolves around two inter-class couples, one of which meets online. Felix works in an Amazon-like warehouse while Alice is a rich and celebrated novelist. “How’d you land yourself a famous girlfriend?” Felix’s brother asks. “Tinder,” Felix replies, to his brother’s surprise. But Alice, tired of the bourgeois literati, is seeking surprise.
In Rooney’s novel “Normal People” (2018), the character Connell was thrust into a middle-class milieu by way of education. Though Connell meets his love interest, Marianne, because his mother cleaned her family’s house, their time at university allows them to grow closer, physically and culturally. In “Beautiful World, Where Are You,” Rooney uses Tinder to bring together two people of vastly different material circumstances without the aid of cultural capital to shorten the distance. Rooney understands that meetings are classed encounters. Alice tells Felix she sensed her college friend’s parents were not thrilled that she — the daughter of a car mechanic — was their daughter’s roommate. “They wanted Eileen to make friends with nice middle-class girls,” she remarks, reminding us how much these supposedly organic, less orchestrated ways of meeting are as engineered as any app.
The more nefarious aspects of internet dating are also the subject of recent novels where technology, rather than shattering our prejudices, sharpens them. In Chantal V. Johnson’s “Post-Traumatic” (2022), a Black woman in her mid-30s sees her white friends inundated with messages on the apps, while she receives a “trickle” and quite a few that use “food-related adjectives describing her skin tone.” She is left feeling both exoticized and rejected. “It was the topic of a dozen think pieces: Black Women Are the Least Desirable,” she muses, referring to the myriad studies of racial biases in online dating. Similarly, in “All This Could be Different,” S — the daughter of South Indian immigrants — admits that she seeks out white women on the apps. “I knew that my thoughts were impolitic and ugly,” she concedes, before adding: “Desire, though, burst through the word should, water breaking down a flimsy dam.” Indeed, Mathews takes care to stress that while the apps represent freedom from certain traditions for S (heterosexuality, arranged marriage), they enable others (colonialism) to endure.
Is technology our collective fairy godmother, getting us into balls to which we otherwise would not be invited, making our world small enough to touch whomever we want?
Dating apps are technologies designed by workers and accessed on smartphones made with minerals extracted under exploitative conditions. Perhaps, then, it should come as no surprise that Kate Folk, who lives in the shadow of Silicon Valley, would produce some of the most searing and complex fiction to date about the apps. Folk’s collection “Out There” is set in a San Francisco where 50 percent of the men on dating apps are estimated to be “blots,” artificial humans originally created to replace low-wage care workers. A Russian company has harnessed the technology to target lonely women, reprogramming the blots to take them on romantic trips to Big Sur, where the machines — taking advantage of spotty cell service — break into their phones and steal their data. At first, the blots become a way for Folk to explore the inanities of dating under patriarchy. In the title story, the narrator is relieved when her boyfriend fails to ask follow-up questions about her personal life. He must be real!
However, a later story, “Big Sur,” includes the perspective of a blot named Roger who, discarded by the Russian company after its scam is uncovered, becomes homeless. While Netflix shows like “The Tinder Swindler” focus our attention on lone wolves, dating scams are increasingly perpetuated by people who have been trafficked, forced to work in texting farms, sending scripts to lonely, vulnerable people. Roger’s erstwhile target Meg takes pity on him, realizing that he, like her, is alone in this expensive city without family money to rely on, and rekindles their relationship. Here Folk displays the ways technology has formed new underclasses — and new forms of identity that can become the basis for love and solidarity.

I was thinking about these novels and stories when Prince Harry’s memoir, “Spare,” was released last month. In it, he describes seeing Meghan Markle for the first time on a friend’s Instagram page, in a reel where her face was altered by a puppy dog filter. It’s tempting to think of this moment as a 21st-century version of “Cinderella,” a you-will-glimpse-her-across-a-crowded-room for the cramped thumb set. Is technology our collective fairy godmother, getting us into balls to which we otherwise would not be invited, making our world small enough to touch whomever we want? There are reasons to swipe both left and right on this new technology. It is murky and messy, full of light and dark. In other words, a perfect match for literature.

2023-02-11,"Portia Kapraun has always seen unwelcome ads on Twitter, usually from major brands pitching her luxury jewelry or vehicles that she, as a librarian in Indiana, could not afford.
But the mix now is far more annoying: More ads for random gold investments, she said, and also a badly designed ad for what looked like a tabletop foosball set constructed with rubber bands and particle board, which promised its product would be the most fun family game she had ever played.
Ms. Kapraun was not interested. But she soon saw the ad again. And again. And again.
“I don’t know who they think I am, but that did not look especially fun,” she said of the foosball set. “These feel like bargain basement advertisers. It mostly seemed like things you would see if you were watching late-night television.”
In a shaky advertising market in an uncertain economy, ads that few people want to see suddenly seem to be everywhere.

Recent ads on Twitter, as described by users, have made the platform feel like a tabloid magazine or the haunting ground of Ron Popeil, the inventor of wares people didn’t know they needed including the Veg-O-Matic, the Ronco Electric Food Dehydrator and the Inside-the-Shell Egg Scrambler. There were ads for T-shirts printed with a horse’s head superimposed on a heartbeat line, served to someone who does not ride horses nor particularly like them. Also: fraudulent ads for discount drones, spots hawking crude gaming apps and promoted posts from people ranting about “puppet masters” and “the slave mind.”
On Instagram, ads from Amazon promote unrecognizable contraptions from obscure merchants, echoing the shopping site Wish, which was notorious for bizarre ads. On YouTube, ads impersonate popular video creators to scam viewers, a phenomenon that has irked Elon Musk and that YouTube says it is addressing.
Advancements in digital advertising technology were meant to improve users’ experience. People interested in shoes are intended to get ads for sneakers and loafers, and not repeated pitches for courses teaching seduction techniques. And the technology is supposed to filter out misleading or dangerous pitches.

Ads on Twitter promoting gold investments and a T-shirt with a horse’s head superimposed on a heartbeat line were shown to a viewer who had no interest in gold or horses.
But lately, on several platforms, the opposite seems to be happening for a variety of reasons, including a slowdown in the overall digital ad market. As numerous deep-pocketed marketers have pulled back, and the softer market has led several digital platforms to lower their ad pricing, opportunities have opened up for less exacting advertisers.

“Anytime you lower the barrier to entry, you’re going to get lower-quality entrants,” said Jessica Fong, an assistant marketing professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.
In the past, buying a newspaper or television ad usually involved calling up a representative who would manually review and place the ad. Now, more than 90 percent of spending on digital display ads happens through automated software.
Social media offers many ad formats — static text, videos, playable games, messaging, brand takeovers, custom filters — and most are getting easier to buy. Many advertisers can now go online and set the budget for how much they are willing to bid through a platform’s automated auction for a spot that reaches their target audience.
Evidence of a junk-ad epidemic is anecdotal; tech platforms rarely reveal data on who advertises with them and how often. Also, quality is in the eye of the beholder — plenty of people willingly click on male enhancement ads, and ads are sometimes most successful when they are eye-catchingly terrible.
Social media platforms have said they have established rigorous advertising policies to safeguard standards and continue to attract first-rate ads from blue-chip companies.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But advertising experts agree that crummy ads — some just irritating, others malicious — appear to be proliferating. They point to a variety of potential causes: internal turmoil at tech companies, weak content moderation and higher-tier advertisers exploring alternatives. In addition, privacy changes by Apple and other tech companies have affected the availability of users’ data and advertisers’ ability to track it to better tailor their ads.
Then, there’s the economy: A survey of 43 multinational companies representing more than $44 billion in advertising spending, conducted last fall by the World Federation of Advertisers, found that nearly 30 percent planned to shrink their marketing budgets this year. Clorox, which budgets hundreds of millions of dollars a year to advertising and promoting products like Burt’s Bees lotions, Brita filters and Pine-Sol cleaners, said this month that it was beginning to streamline its marketing, which included cutting back on spending.
Digital ad spending, while still growing overall, “has decelerated precipitously,” according to an analysis last month by the research firm Insider Intelligence.
Twitter seems to be faring the worst. The company has struggled to retain top-flight advertisers since Mr. Musk took over as owner in October, amid fears of a proliferation of hate speech and misinformation on the platform. Its 10 largest advertisers last year spent 55 percent less during Mr. Musk’s tenure than they did a year earlier, with six of them spending nothing so far in 2023, according to estimates from the research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter has offered buy-one-get-one-free deals, discounts and bonus incentives to lure back advertisers, media buyers said.
But advertising troubles have hit the biggest publicly traded social networks, too. Snapchat’s parent company last month posted its slowest-ever rate of quarterly growth and projected a sales drop for the current quarter. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said ad sales at YouTube slipped nearly 8 percent in the latest quarter.

Last year, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, reported its first decline ever in quarterly revenue (it fell again last quarter). Ad prices on Facebook and Instagram fell 24 percent in the last quarter of 2022 from a year earlier, according to the investment bank Piper Sandler.
Shareholder pressure, stoked by years of big profits, continues to push those companies to generate revenue wherever possible  — including, experts said, through selling low-quality ads.
Corey Richardson, vice president at the multicultural ad agency Fluent360 in Chicago, said he was seeing more ads for items in which he had no interest — Hawaiian shirts featuring “Star Wars” characters, a fountain shaped like hands folded in the prayer position, all mixed in with vaccine misinformation and the occasional video depicting violence.
“They’re just taking whatever money comes — beggars can’t be choosers,” Mr. Richardson said.
Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment. YouTube said it invested “significantly” in ad quality and consumer experience.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Other factors are also contributing to lower ad quality, Mr. Richardson said. Social media advertising, once a niche art practiced by specialist agencies, is now easily available to anyone. Many of them are eschewing targeted ads — placements intended to reach specific audiences, usually at a higher cost — in favor of a cheaper spray-and-pray approach online, hoping to catch the attention of gullible or bored shoppers.
Image
Instagram users said they were being bombarded with ads for products, like those above, that they could not identify and had no interest in.
Major social media platforms are now “like the mall in your hometown that used to be the good mall,” Mr. Richardson said: “But now there’s no longer a Macy’s there — it’s just a calendar store and a place selling beepers.”
The ads are also increasingly inescapable. Twitter recently revoked free access for third-party services like Tweetbot and Twitterific, which helped many users avoid unwanted ads. A project that blocked YouTube ads was forced to shut down in March; months later, YouTube said it concluded a small experiment that tried to reduce ad breaks by moving more ads into fewer interruptions, sometimes showing viewers as many as 10 unskippable ads in a row. In the fall, a survey by Insider Intelligence found that 52 percent of Facebook users reported seeing more ads on the platform, compared with nearly half of YouTube and Instagram users.
Meta allows users to personalize their ad experience, changing their preferences when they see an ad they are uninterested in. The company has also said it does not approve ads about subjects like climate change that its fact-checking partners have categorized as false, and it takes down ads that violate its policies.
In the past year, researchers and journalists on Facebook have discovered ads for dangerous or illegal dietary supplements; dozens of since-removed ads showing photoshopped images of the Australian prime minister that linked to investment scams; and allegedly misleading advertising timed to the COP27 climate summit. After being contacted by The New York Times, Meta took down Instagram ads that ply cancer patients with polished pseudoscience promoting vague but expensive alternative treatments.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
YouTube said it prohibited ads that impersonate businesses, swindle users or employ clickbait tactics. The company said it blocked or removed more than 3.4 billion ads and suspended more than 5.6 million advertiser accounts in 2021.
“Though there are always bad actors looking to bypass enforcement systems across all tech platforms, we remain vigilant in trying to identify and remove them as quickly as we can,” YouTube said in a statement.
Beyond social platforms, bad ads appear elsewhere on the internet. But streaming services and news websites tend to have stricter advertising guidelines and more limited and expensive ad space, which makes ads easier to regulate. Some publishers, like Bloomberg Media, are starting to avoid third-party brokers and automated auctions of ad space, which deal with enormous volumes and are more likely to miss low-quality ads.
Social media is a far easier target for the small but motivated group of anti-vaccine advertisers studied by David A. Broniatowski, who helps run the Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics at the George Washington University. Their ads are designed to evade “very brittle” moderation algorithms by spacing out the letters of banned keywords or replacing them with emojis, he said.
“They will use whatever means necessary to get their message out there,” he said. “Ads are simply one tool in their toolbox.”"

Re “The Unlikely Bookstore of My Dreams,” by Ezra Klein (column, Jan. 30):
I second Mr. Klein’s praise for his — and my — lifelong refuge: the bookstore, especially Barnes & Noble, whose survival was one of the few truly good things to come out of the pandemic.
Yes, Amazon carries everything and at lower prices, but there has always been something special about being inside a bookstore — be it a Barnes & Noble or an independent store — and taking time to browse the shelves in different departments and hold the books in my hands.
Sometimes I’m in the mood to look at every book in the history section; other times it’s baseball or photography or biography. Once in a while, I’ll spot a classic novel I’ve avoided for decades and give it a try.
I confess that I have taken a book off a bookstore’s shelf and spent hours in the store reading it from start to finish. Why? As Mr. Klein wrote, what makes a bookstore great is that it’s a place not just to buy books, “but to be among them.”

And all those books on the half-dozen bookshelves at my home serve as continual reminders to me of all the things that have piqued my interest over the years.

I just finished reading Ezra Klein’s earnest effort to nominate Barnes & Noble for sainthood. Doesn’t he know about Barnes & Noble’s history of devouring small, independent bookstores, that the chain was once the bane of all independent bookstores? (The movie “You’ve Got Mail” was about such predatory behavior.)
I was the manager of the old and rare books department at a Shakespeare & Company bookstore on the Upper West Side in Manhattan when Barnes & Noble appeared in our neighborhood like a hungry Tyrannosaurus, devouring our store and a couple of others, like the much treasured children’s bookstore Eeyore’s.

To the Editor:
Ross Benjamin happily places himself on the right side of history in “The Search for the Real Franz Kafka Continues” (Opinion guest essay, Feb. 5). As grateful as I am to Mr. Benjamin for his recent completist translation of Kafka’s diaries, I don’t think it’s necessary to trash Max Brod, Kafka’s friend and literary executor, for his less complete version.
Mr. Benjamin is anachronistic when he positions Brod as someone who does wrong by Kafka in cleaning up and vetting the Kafka diaries. Today we revere error, fragmentation and queerness. But when Brod published the diaries, he was embarking on a project at a time that none of these qualities were valued, and publishing any of it was against his great friend’s wishes, so Brod took cautious yet important steps toward a reveal of Kafka.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Try to imagine publishing your best friend’s very personal diaries, unedited, against their wishes many years after their death. I would suggest that what Brod did was just enough, indeed perfect for the moment, and that we see Mr. Benjamin’s new fuller translation as following in Brod’s great footsteps.
Rather than take Brod down, we should be on our knees to him for his courage and insight, and thank him for what he has given us.

Re “A Ban on TikTok Won’t Make Us More Secure,” by Glenn S. Gerstell (Opinion guest essay, Feb. 4):
Privacy legislation is, indeed, a key part of a larger solution to helping our laws catch up to the realities of our digital world — and to preventing foreign adversaries from using our data against us.
But we also need to help Americans learn how to navigate our online world and become less susceptible to manipulation. Otherwise, the threats that Mr. Gerstell so aptly described will remain.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Luckily, there is another promising solution: We can ensure that more Americans are news literate.
News literacy teaches you to identify credible sources and separate fact from fiction. Evidence increasingly shows that this approach can help “inoculate” people against being manipulated by misinformation. Just look to Finland, which requires media literacy instruction starting in preschool. Its citizens are the most resistant to misinformation of all Europeans surveyed, as you reported on Jan. 11 (“How Finland Teaches Even Youngest Pupils to Spot Misinformation”).
We need a concerted effort from state and local governments to make news literacy instruction a reality for all Americans. Let’s demand media literacy instruction in schools and protect ourselves from misleading claims that spread online.

False-positive alerts from Apple Watch’s health features are not new. In 2020, I co-wrote a peer-reviewed research study that discovered that many alerts from Apple Watch’s abnormal heart rhythm detection feature were false positives.

We observed that for every seven patients who went to a health care setting with an alert, only one was diagnosed with clinically actionable cardiovascular disease. These erroneous alerts lead to the overuse of health care resources.
Apple and other technology companies must carefully consider unintended consequences of false-positive alerts when they develop health-focused features, lest their products turn into the algorithm that cried wolf.

Unrepresentative Polls
To the Editor:
Re “Is Trump Way Up or Way Down?” (The Upshot, nytimes.com, Feb. 3):
Pollsters seem to want to ignore the simple fact that it is impossible to have a representative sample when people increasingly do not respond to pollsters. Pollsters argue that they use statistical tools to correct for unrepresentative samples, but their obvious failures in recent elections belie this.
Pollsters and the media, including The New York Times, have a vested interest in polling, but given all the poor polling it’s hard to argue that it offers significant benefits. Polling is more speculative than news and should be treated as such.

Redding, Conn."
2023-02-13,"GLENDALE, Ariz. — The N.F.L. strives to be a 365-day-a-year showcase.
From the Super Bowl to the scouting combine in a few weeks to the start of free agency in March and the draft in April and the preparation for the new season a few months after that, the drumbeat of attraction and attention never seems to stop. With the 2022 season in the books, with a thrilling victory by the Kansas City Chiefs over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl, here are some of the issues that will be the talk of the N.F.L. even before the next season starts on Sept. 7.
The post-Brady, Mahomes era 
Assuming Tom Brady really has retired after 23 seasons, Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes will be the most recognizable player in the league. His leading his team to a second-half, comeback win over the Eagles, 38-35, only cements his standing as the next big thing. Like Brady, he has piled up wins — Kansas City has the most wins in the league since Mahomes became a starter in 2018 — and his creativity and flair for dramatic plays make him the envy of fans, sponsors and broadcasters.
“A lot of what makes the game as exciting as it is are the dual threat quarterbacks” who can run as well as throw, said Mike Mulvihill, the executive vice president and head of strategy and analytics at Fox Sports, which, like all of the league’s broadcast partners, is eager to show Kansas City games. “Mahomes is probably the best representation of that.”
The toll of high-profile injuries
Injuries dominated the news last season, particularly to Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who sustained at least two concussions, and to Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin, who went into cardiac arrest on the field after a routine tackle. Their scary episodes again highlighted the brutality of the sport, and how a lot of N.F.L. players, despite the money made during their careers, can struggle to get help afterward.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Doctors have called on Tagovailoa to stop playing to avoid risking long-term brain damage, and last week, 10 former players sued Commissioner Roger Goodell and the league’s disability plan for, they claimed, systematically denying them health benefits.

The league “portrayed this image like, ‘we care about the players, we’re doing all this stuff for player safety,’” said one of the plaintiffs, Eric Smith, who played for the Jets for seven seasons and now has a host of physical and mental ailments. “And then as soon as you’re not on the roster making them any money playing out on the field, they’re like, ‘OK, we’ll give you five years of insurance, now go leave us alone.’”
Dearth of Black coaches
At a season-ending news conference last week, Goodell was repeatedly asked about the lack of diversity at the league’s highest ranks, including among owners and head coaches. Goodell has promised to do better, but progress in many cases has been incremental at best. There are just three Black head coaches (a fourth, Mike McDaniel of the Dolphins, identifies as biracial) among the 32 teams in a league in which nearly 70 percent of the players are Black.
The league is battling a lawsuit brought by former head coaches of color who have accused the league of discriminatory hiring practices. Rod Graves, the executive director of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which lobbies the N.F.L. to increase diversity, said that the way to get the owners — the ultimate decision makers — to promote diversity on their teams is to show that it is good for their bottom lines.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“This is an area that is like a sore on one portion of your body, and we can do more in this area to make the game attractive to everyone who’s qualified,” Graves said. “We’ve been around for 104, 105 years, and it is concerning that we’re still having these conversations today that we only have a few head coaches rather than many head coaches of color.”
More games will be streamed
N.F.L. games remain the most-watched programming on television partly because they are shown primarily on over-the-air networks like CBS and NBC, which starting this year will collectively pay the N.F.L. roughly $10 billion a year for the next decade.
But the league knows that younger fans are more likely to stream games over the internet, so it’s tiptoeing into the streaming space. Thursday night games were shown exclusively on Amazon last season, and this year, the popular Sunday Ticket package will be on YouTube, which will pay the N.F.L. at least $2 billion a year for the rights.
But N.F.L. games won’t be disappearing from over-the-air channels anytime soon.
“We feel that for as much as the business is evolving, when it comes to live content and premium sports events, people are finding them on the traditional outlets just as they did 10, 20, 30 years ago,” Mulvihill from Fox Sports said.
Will the Washington Commanders be sold?
In November, Daniel Snyder, the embattled owner of the Washington Commanders, said he hired bankers to explore a sale of part or all of the team he has owned since 1999. That came several weeks after Jim Irsay, owner of the Indianapolis Colts, said Snyder might have to be removed for sullying the league’s reputation.
It is unclear whether Snyder will unload the team, but if he does, it will sell for more than the $4.65 billion the Denver Broncos fetched in 2022. Several billionaires have shown interest, but Jeff Bezos, the executive chairman of Amazon and one of the richest men in the world, could easily outbid them, something many league owners would welcome. His name keeps popping up in news reports, but he remains coy about his interest."

Posey, 54, has forged an unclassifiable career since her days as the “it” girl of 1990s independent cinema — mirrored in her oddball 2018 book, “You’re on an Airplane: A Self-Mythologizing Memoir.” She has created a series of indelible characters in Christopher Guest comedies, including “Best in Show,” but has also memorably brought her off-kilter rhythms to high-profile gigs like the flamboyant assistant district attorney Freda Black in the HBO Max mini-series “The Staircase” and the scheming Dr. Smith on the Netflix reboot of “Lost in Space.”
As for Nef, 30, she landed the recurring role of Gittel in the Amazon series “Transparent” days after graduating from Columbia University, in 2015. The first openly transgender woman to receive a worldwide modeling contract, Nef also writes for various magazines, appeared in the Off Broadway play “Des Moines” in December, and has a couple of big projects arriving later this year: Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” movie and the HBO series “The Idol” in which she’ll appear alongside the Weeknd and Lily-Rose Depp.

In a meeting that seems almost predestined, the pair are now sharing a stage in Thomas Bradshaw’s “The Seagull/Woodstock, NY,” a New Group production in previews at the Pershing Square Signature Center. (It is scheduled to open Feb. 28 and run through March 26.) A contemporary riff on Chekhov set in the Catskills, the play renames the charismatic, brittle actress Irina Arkadina as Irene (Posey), while the moody, romantic Masha has become Sasha (Nef).

“They’re iconic in who they are and what they bring to their work,” the play’s director, Scott Elliott, said of Nef and Posey during a phone call. “They’re able to bring themselves to the parts so there’s very little separation between the actor and the role. Their humanity peeks through.”
This quality helps explain why both New York-based actresses have a similar ability to connect with a character’s pathos, while also deploying unerring comic timing: Posey’s turns in those Guest films are pitch-perfect, while Nef was praised by Ben Brantley, in his review of Jeremy O. Harris’s play “‘Daddy,’” for delivering “the production’s sharpest satirical performance.”

What did you know of each other before “The Seagull/Woodstock, NY”?
PARKER POSEY Hari Nef — oh, she was in “Transparent.” I remembered exactly what a performance that was and how much she lit up a scene. She changed the temperature of the room. I don’t keep up with a lot of things. I don’t have a lot of social media — I forgot my Instagram password a while ago and I tried to sign on a few times with the password I thought I remembered. But of course it was the wrong password.
HARI NEF I knew so much about your work. “Party Girl” is a favorite, but I’d also seen you on “Search Party,” the whole gamut. A friend of mine said that you in “The House of Yes” is probably one of the greatest screen performances he’s ever seen. And he doesn’t play.
POSEY When we met for the first read-through, Thomas said, “I’ve just got to tell you, ‘The House of Yes’ was a big inspiration for me and my writing.” That [script] was Wendy MacLeod’s Yale thesis. I didn’t know that playwriting can be so subversive.
NEF I was always so attracted to you and your work because you were glamorous and you were dramatic and you were cool and you were distinctive and uncompromising, but not in a way that was obvious or traditional. You are beautiful and talented, that is obvious and traditional, but you always did things your way. I knew that if I was going to make a career as an actor, much less as an actress, I would have to do things non-traditionally. I didn’t have anyone quite exactly like me to look to so I looked at your work and I looked at Tilda [Swinton] and Chloë [Sevigny].
POSEY I got lucky because at a time in the culture, you could do Off Broadway and afford your $700 a month apartment. And you could do independent movies: “It’s only 22 days, yeah, I’ll do that one.” It was kind of punk rock or like being in a band. Everyone was hanging out together and it was very organic. It was a little pocket of time that didn’t last that long.

NEF I’ve been able to spend my entire fall and winter doing Off Broadway shows because I did Fashion Week before this and that visibility brings other opportunities. You can get paid three, four, five times what I’m going to make for both these plays combined by going to one dinner and being photographed there in an outfit. I post images of the films I like on Instagram not just because I find them inspiring and beautiful — I do — but it’s me going, “I want to be in movies like this.”
POSEY You’re having the best of both worlds because to be online and have a social media presence is kind of to be your own magazine. I need to learn. But that time is a different time; it is your generation’s time right now.
NEF You’re literally from the last moment where it was possible to be cool. Looking at that capital-C definition of cool all the way back to Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, there’s talent, there’s glamour, there’s drive, there’s darkness. But there’s also a mystery and a specificity, and you lose that mystery and specificity by existing online. Because of the money thing and the rent thing, it has become essentially untenable to be cool, to be mysterious, to have that allure being an indie legend.
Do you think it’s one thing to be perceived as cool and another to be taken seriously as an actor?
NEF So much of my entry into this industry and this practice was around “Transparent.” I was riding on this flotilla of discourse about things that had nothing to do with what I could do as an actor. I thought I had to sing for my supper just for a seat at the table. Maybe I was right, to a certain extent, but it became like, “Do I really want people to know me by what I say or what I am or what my private medical history is?” No, I want to be known for what I do as an actor.
POSEY Cool is when there’s something original or unexpected, or seems to have some kind of luck around it. Which your appearing on that show was: the unexpected, something new, something fresh. And that is not orchestrated — that’s luck. I see that now. I look at life and the path of an actor as having that luck. And I think that’s very enviable.

NEF I’ve been very lucky. I remain lucky. The play I did before “Daddy” was my senior thesis in college: I played Arkadina in “The Seagull.” I had gone through what I had gone through in college and I never thought that I would get to go onstage to do Chekhov, much less play her. I knew that I probably wouldn’t be able to play a role like that again for many, many years — not because of age but because of the size and the heft of the role. I haven’t played a role like Arkadina since then, but I’m back doing “The Seagull” and that is more than was promised to me at that moment in history.

“It’s interesting to observe how quick people are to villainize strong women,” Posey said of her character, Irene, a showbiz mom in “The Seagull/Woodstock, NY.” “The misogyny is on fire, still.”

Josefina Santos for The New York Times
Parker, what drew you to Arkadina/Irene?
POSEY What attracted me the most to this part was the narcissistic mother, and the power that a mother has over her son. And she’s a showbiz mom, someone with a lot of heart and theatricality and all that. I’m so lucky as a middle-aged woman to be playing this part. It’s interesting to observe how quick people are to villainize strong women, how fun it is to see the worst. People love to call someone a bitch. I mean, the misogyny is on fire, still.
NEF I play a lot of bitches.
Why do you think that is?
NEF Well, I’m no ingénue. I write, and a lot of the bitches I’ve played are also writers, thinkers. Smart. “Bitch” is often a fill-in for intelligent, for articulate, for opinionated, queer, not conventionally feminine or not conventionally beautiful. I think the “Barbie” stuff happened because I didn’t play bitchy and I didn’t play dumb and I didn’t play plastic in the audition.
POSEY Having been cast as a female Dr. Smith, that was such a coup, I was so grateful for that gig. If you can live in Hollywood, it’s a lot easier to get cast and be a part of that world. But I wanted to walk around and see other people.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
NEF What is your relationship to the word “scene-stealer”? It’s the word that really follows me. It’s not a bad thing: It means I’m doing good work in small roles.
POSEY That is a character actor making strong choices. When you have a small role in something big, you have to fill it in a certain way, and that’s its own thing.
NEF If you’re a bold flavor — which I know I am — it’s more intuitive for people to see you as seasoning to the steak. I’d like to be the steak someday, but I know I have to earn it. So many of your iconic roles have been supporting and I’m wondering if you ever felt minimized by it.
POSEY [long pause] Your 20s are really intense and then the culture changes and you’re, like, “Where am I going to fit in? I’m going to be in ‘Blade: Trinity’ playing a vampire? Never thought I’d see the day but yeah, I want to work and that’ll be interesting.” And then it’s the 40s. It’s heartbreaking when you become aware of just how intensely male-dominated our stories are, especially when you mature as a person and as a woman.
NEF The shifts in the culture are by and large cosmetic when it comes to power and who gets the green light and who gets the sign-off for studio things. I can’t control the way I’m cast or how people see me.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
POSEY But you can see and acknowledge where you are. You’re in the mix. We’re so lucky to do what we love to do. A lot of people don’t.
NEF That’s the bottom line of gratitude right now. This sounds corny but every day I’m so grateful to be here with you, to be here with everyone, to work through this winter onstage. It’s not guaranteed for anyone, much less someone like me or you."
2023-02-16,"As the new Republican-led panel tasked with investigating the weaponization of government continued to issue new subpoenas this week, those who orchestrated the inquiry that its leaders have claimed as a model are warning the chairman against allowing his work to veer into partisan territory.
More than two dozen staff members from the panel formed in the 1970s that came to be known as the Church Committee sent an open letter on Wednesday to Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and its powerful new subcommittee. They offered advice for how he could follow in the footsteps of their panel, which uncovered decades of intelligence and civil liberties abuses under presidents of both parties and set the gold standard in Congress for scrutinizing the executive branch.
The counsel is simple: Pursue a bipartisan inquiry, follow the facts, do not try to interfere with open investigations and operate in good faith.
Read the Church Committee Open Letter
Aides to the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, created in 1975, wrote to Representative Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican leading the new Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, with advice on how to make his inquiry successful.

The Church Committee, formed in 1975 and commonly known by the name of its chairman, Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, was formally called the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities. It investigated warrantless electronic surveillance affecting U.S. citizens; C.I.A. assassination plots against foreign leaders; C.I.A. and F.B.I. mail-opening programs; C.I.A. drug testing on unwitting governmental personnel; communications intercepts affecting Americans; and the disruption and discrediting of peaceful civil rights and antiwar activists.
It is regarded by members of both parties as the paragon of a bipartisan and productive congressional inquiry.

Mr. Jordan’s panel, by contrast, has begun amid partisan strife. Democrats have objected even to the creation of the committee and its goals, and Republicans have made clear that their aim is to focus on one side of the partisan ledger, seeking evidence that the federal government is biased against conservatives and the right. The formation of a “Church-style committee” was a top demand of a band of right-wing Republicans who resisted electing Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, and its inaugural hearing last week relitigated a litany of old grievances about the treatment of former President Donald J. Trump and others.
“If they’re sincere about emulating the Church Committee model, then we wanted the particulars to be laid out there clearly so that everyone has guideposts to measure the extent to which Jordan is succeeding or failing and living up to the legacy of the Church Committee,” Frederick D. Baron, a former associate deputy attorney general who was a lawyer for the Church Committee, said of the letter.
ADVERTISEMENT

Paul Michel, a former federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan who served as a Republican aide on the Church Committee, said many lines of inquiry the panel had pursued did not pan out.
“There were a lot of hints of some very bad conduct, but when we pursued all the documents and the witnesses, some of it turned out to be quite innocent,” he recalled. “So if the Jordan committee is evenhanded factually, they’ll do a good job and it’ll be credible. But if they pursue what some people might call conspiracy theories, and only look at things that seem to support that, it will eventually be viewed as not credible.”
A spokesman for the panel declined to comment.
The letter comes as the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government has begun issuing subpoenas, seeking documents for an investigation into whether the government mistreated parents who were scrutinized after school officials endured threats and harassment over mask mandates and teaching about racism.
On Wednesday, Mr. Jordan issued more subpoenas, this time to the technology companies Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft for documents and communications relating to whether they had worked with the federal government to block certain Americans from communicating through their platforms — something Mr. Jordan calls “censorship by proxy.”
The subpoenas require the chief executives of those companies, Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella, to turn over all requested documents and communications by March 23.

The committee did not issue a subpoena to Twitter or its owner, Elon Musk, who has at times aligned himself with the right, urging voters last fall to elect Republicans and saying he would welcome Mr. Trump back to his platform.
In the letters, the panel said such an action was unnecessary because Twitter “recently set a benchmark for how transparent Big Tech companies can be about interactions with government over censorship.” The committee cited the release of the so-called Twitter Files, which showed how the company restricted some tweets after receiving requests to do so from government officials.
The House Judiciary Committee said it has been working to get documents from the companies since December, when Republicans were in the minority, without success.
“Your response without compulsory process has been woefully inadequate,” Mr. Jordan wrote to the executives.
On Thursday, Mr. Jordan sent a letter to Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, demanding answers about what he called the bureau’s “targeting of a set of Catholic Americans for their religious beliefs.” At issue is a Jan. 23 memo from the F.B.I.’s Richmond field office that linked “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists” with a “radical traditionalist Catholic” ideology, prompting outrage from Catholic groups and Republican attorneys general. The F.B.I. headquarters in Washington has since disavowed the document and blamed the field office for its creation.

The letter requires Mr. Wray to produce documents about the memo by March 2.
At the weaponization committee’s first hearing, Democrats fought against the panel’s very premise and argued that Mr. Jordan had not given agencies enough time to respond to him before issuing subpoenas.
Church Committee staff members recalled a different era on Capitol Hill, when Republicans and Democrats worked closely together and “to an extent that my students can hardly even imagine,” said Gregory F. Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council who was a Democratic staff member on the panel.
“On the Church Committee, there was broad agreement that these things ought to be looked at and, in the end, there was broad agreement on what we might do about them,” he said. “In this case, there’s no broad agreement on what ought to be looked at.”"
2023-02-17,"You’ll meet his bloodshot, menacing gaze in any number of neighborhoods in New York, his mouth stretched into an open, hungry grin, his tentacle-like limbs ready to envelop you. On Mott Street in Chinatown, he is lashed to display racks in front of shops selling New York City-themed cooking aprons or “Got Weed?” T-shirts; in Bushwick, he’s a frequent presence on the tabletops of sidewalk sellers. He might be blue, or orange or tie-dye, or even wearing a little Santa hat and Christmas scarf.
His name is Huggy Wuggy, and he has joined the ranks of unavoidable knockoff toys and trinkets marketed to toddlers, teens and Hot Topic adults all over the world: Bosnia, Spain, Laos, South Korea or anywhere else you might find a tourist-trap souvenir shop or market of bootleg goods.
Among those who sell Huggy, many don’t seem to know exactly where he comes from or what he is. But they know he’s popular with children — and the parents willing to drop $10 to appease them.
For instance, outside Ma68 Trading in Manhattan, Huggy was available on a recent visit in gray, red or green, each clipped to a circular clothes rack, strappado style. There, the toy is so popular that the signature blue version is often sold out.

“I think he’s from a TV show,” George Ma, the store’s owner, said vaguely. (Not exactly.) “He’s most popular with 4- to 9-year-olds.” (This tracks.)
In fact, Huggy Wuggy is the primary villain of an indie horror video game called Poppy Playtime, set in an abandoned toy factory. Huggy, one of the toys formerly made in the factory, is first seen in a display with a happy, innocent smile before he mysteriously disappears. Players solve various puzzles, and later, he chases them through the factory’s ventilation system, his smile since widened to reveal razor-sharp teeth that he uses to eat the game’s losers.

It’s freaky. But what makes Huggy truly unsettling is his second life on YouTube, where children as young as preschool age come across fan tribute videos to the character — and then become fans themselves.
It’s a strange lesson in the porous boundaries between media for many children, who are unwittingly led by Silicon Valley’s many and mysterious algorithms to follow their favorite characters no matter the context, online and off.

Remixing Stock Characters for the Internet
Ezra Watkins, a 6-year-old in Manchester, England, first came across Huggy Wuggy on ExtremeToys TV, a YouTube channel that features two young brothers playing video games, having Nerf battles and creating short vlog-style films in which they chase and unmask various monsters like Bigfoot, Chucky and Huggy, all created using special effects.
Ezra’s father, Gareth Watkins, says he sees Huggy as part of an “extended universe” of children’s internet characters. “It’s almost like the stock characters in commedia dell’arte or pantomime: Anyone can pick them up and use them for whatever they like and the audience will understand them,” he said.
While Mr. Watkins allows his son to watch YouTube videos featuring Huggy, he believes the game itself is a bit too frightening for Ezra. “Even though there isn’t adult content or blood, the jump scares are much harsher than what you’d find in all-ages games,” he said.
For his part, Ezra says that Huggy is “scary, like real scary. It was supposed to be friendly but no.” Still, Ezra claims to love horror, and says he hopes to be able to play the game eventually.
Poppy Playtime was an unexpected hit for Mob Entertainment, the small studio that released the game in 2021. “It’s not that common, from what I hear anecdotally from other video game developers, that your first game would be a success to the extent that this one has been,” said Zach Belanger, Mob’s chief executive and the creator of Huggy Wuggy.

Mr. Belanger, 25, found his way to video game making via YouTube fan mash-ups himself.
At 18, he and his then-16-year-old brother Seth found popularity with their own channel, EnchantedMob, by making videos that remixed familiar characters from properties like the indie horror game Five Nights at Freddy’s or Minecraft.

Eventually, with a small staff and the profits from their YouTube videos, the brothers developed and self-published Poppy Playtime on the independent gaming platform Steam.
YouTube, once again, was pivotal to the game’s success. Just one day after Poppy Playtime’s release, a popular horror gaming YouTuber posted a walk-through video of himself playing Poppy Playtime for his millions of subscribers. That video now has 33 million views. While Mob declined to share the total number of times Poppy Playtime has been downloaded, the game — once $4.99, now free — has over 47,000 reviews on Steam.
Why Do Kids Like Huggy Wuggy?
Though not an animator himself, Mr. Belanger developed the early concept design for Huggy Wuggy. The idea, mainly, was to create something entirely new.
“Is he a monkey? Is he a sock monkey? Is he a bear?” Mr. Belanger said. “He’s a thing, but not really anything. He’s an animal, but not one you’ve ever seen before.”
To make the creature frightening, Mr. Belanger’s technique was simple: make it really big compared with everything else onscreen. The conceit applied not only to Huggy Wuggy’s height, but to his lanky limbs and outsize smile that, as the game progresses, morphs into more of a hungry maw.

“The great monsters in horror are all really simple,” said Jenna Stoeber, who has covered horror media and video games for Polygon. According to Ms. Stoeber, Huggy’s face instantly telegraphs terror. “It’s clearly a toy designed to be cute that has been twisted and warped and now it has this mouthful of horrible jagged teeth.”
Ms. Stoeber suggested that children are more open to horror figures than adults might suspect.
As for why the game itself took off, she speculated that it was ideal for Twitch users livestreaming their game play for an audience: It’s short, for one thing, and it offers “the chance to have jump scares and ‘ahhh’ faces,” Ms. Stoeber said. “YouTube videos that have big human faces making weird expressions always do well.”

The remixes, like the one Ezra Watkins happened across, also helped. In them, Huggy interacts with video game characters from other franchises — which might lead fans of those other games to discover him. And the digital illustrators who make these remixes often place the characters into simple, emotion-driven plots that children can grasp, and which give Huggy a range of feelings he doesn’t display in the original game.
“Of course Huggy Wuggy himself can look kind of freaky, with his teeth and all that, but my family is a little unconventional in that we find things like that funny,” said Amanda Paulin of Salem, Ore., whose 5-year-old son sleeps with Huggy plushies every night after his older sisters introduced him to the character. “We haven’t run into the scary Huggy Wuggy yet, but we know he’s out there.”
Ms. Paulin said the content her son had been exposed to so far had been “fairly silly.” “When my son first saw the character,” she added, “he laughed really hard.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It’s easy for a child to become familiar with Huggy without having ever even heard of the game. YouTube is teeming with videos created specifically for children, and the platform goes to great lengths to keep them watching as long as possible. While YouTube has cleaned up some of its children’s content (you can’t find scary Poppy Playtime-related videos on YouTube Kids, for example) and now gives parents the option to turn off its autoplay feature, the site still sends viewers down rabbit holes.
“There’s a lot of creators out there that will just create videos that are meant to game the algorithm for small children whose parents put an iPad in front of them and let YouTube videos play while they make dinner,” said Ted Hentschke, head of productions at DreadXP, a horror game publisher in Los Angeles.
The Offline Knockoff Market
Because the Huggy that children know is often detached from the Huggy of the game, the market for physical Huggy toys doesn’t differentiate much between the original character and his digital knockoffs. Though almost all of these plushies feature the villainous face and body structure, many come in colors that never actually appear in the game.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of those toys are themselves unlicensed.

The game came out in October 2021, and “by November, there were already knockoff Huggy dolls,” said Drake Vogl, a licensing assistant at Mob.
It took the company five months from the game’s release to develop its own  licensed Poppy Playtime products, giving other manufacturers ample opportunity to create and distribute knockoff Huggy merchandise to meet the growing demand.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“We’ve had to fight trademark and copyright squatters worldwide,” Mr. Vogl said.
Arsenio Navarro, Mob Entertainment’s director of business development, estimated that counterfeit products have cost the company millions of dollars in royalty revenue. According to Trevor Vogl, a Mob financial analyst, “upwards of 500,000” plush dolls and toys exported from China that were based on the company’s characters have been seized and destroyed by customs officials; a service that Mob uses to identify counterfeit vendors has flagged more than 300,000 online listings for products featuring Mob’s intellectual property.
The company is targeting e-commerce operations and international manufacturers peddling fake Huggys. According to Mr. Navarro, more than 15,000 Amazon listings have been taken down in the last three months alone.
Mob is working on expanding the world of Huggy. Poppy Playtime: Chapter 2 was released last May, and a multiplayer game set in the factory was released in December. And though the fake Huggys might represent money lost, they have also served as an enormous unplanned marketing campaign for the brand.
“Most of our fans have never played our game,” Mr. Belanger said. “The brand awareness is greater than our ability to monetize it successfully to this point.” And as for the knockoffs, “it’s a good problem to have, I’m told,” he said. To this day, Mob has never spent any money on marketing its games."

SZA’s second major label album, “SOS,” spent its first seven weeks atop the Billboard album chart, a startling feat for a performer who has at almost every turn made choices inconsistent with the demands of pop stardom.
Five years have passed since her debut album, “Ctrl.” She generally makes music with a small circle and doesn’t collaborate widely. Until lately, she has largely shunned the press.
But the release of “SOS” appears to mark a new chapter for the singer, who at 33 is one of the most forthright songwriters working, and who has a flexible vocal approach that’s only expanding.

Good morning. I had a wonderful conversation the other day with Kate Reid, Australia’s queen of croissants, whose wise and ambitious cookbook, “Lune: Croissants All Day, All Night,” has just been published in the United States. Kate’s recipe for extraordinary croissants runs pages, takes three days and results in a croissant you’ll be extremely proud to have made and delighted to eat.
But that’s probably not a recipe to start on a Sunday afternoon. Instead, you should try out a hack Kate offered me for enlivening stale or not extraordinary store-bought croissants, which the excellent Claire Saffitz wrote about for The Times in 2021: almond croissants (above).
Make those in the midday hours and serve with afternoon tea. Later you can assemble Melissa Clark’s new recipe for roasted ginger chicken with peanut sauce, and bring your nutty day to a close.

2023-02-20,"The New York Times won three George Polk Awards, two for its coverage of the war in Ukraine and one for an investigation into Hasidic Jewish schools in New York that denied students a basic education.
On Monday, Long Island University, which has run the prestigious Polk Awards for journalism since 1949, announced winners in 15 categories chosen from 515 submissions. A special award went to the youngest ever recipient of a Polk.
“Interestingly, a lot of reporters went after large, thematic stories, like the role of private equity companies in buying up hospitals, private homes and apartment complexes,” John Darnton, the curator of the awards, said in a statement. “And the war in Ukraine produced superb war reporting, done at great peril.”
The Times won the prize for foreign reporting. That submission included daily reporting on the war in Ukraine as well as a feature by Roger Cohen on President Vladimir V. Putin’s “22-year slide from statesman to tyrant” in Russia. The Times’s submission also included “Putin’s War,” a 13,000-word, two-month investigation that exposed Russia’s powerful military as unprepared, ill-equipped and badly managed.

The Times also won the education reporting award for work by Eliza Shapiro and Brian M. Rosenthal that exposed how private schools in New York’s Hasidic Jewish community were failing to provide students with an adequate education, despite receiving more than a quarter of a billion dollars in public funds annually.
Lynsey Addario of The Times won the photojournalism award for a photo that captured the horror in Ukraine. In the photo, the bodies of a Ukrainian mother, her two children and a family friend lay on the ground after they were killed by Russian mortar fire while trying to flee Ukraine. The citation for the award noted that Ms. Addario “dove for cover as the shell landed and then took the gruesome photo on instinct.”

The award for war reporting was given to Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant of The Associated Press. The A.P. was the last remaining Western news organization in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol after it came under fire from Russia, and the team of journalists documented the siege for almost three weeks before escaping.
The national reporting award went to Josh Gerstein, Alex Ward, Peter Canellos and the staff of Politico for their stunning scoop on a rare leak from the Supreme Court: a draft of the ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years. The official decision from the court came less than two months later. Politico continued its reporting with articles that examined the court’s conservative majority and its hunt for the leaker of the draft.

John Archibald, Ashley Remkus and Ramsey Archibald of the news website AL.com won the prize for local reporting for an investigation into how the police force of the tiny town of Brookside, Ala., preyed on poorer residents with an aggressive increase in traffic citations and vehicle seizures, resulting in 640 percent growth in the town’s revenues over two years.
The Reuters series “Undocumented and Underage,” by Joshua Schneyer, Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke, which also focused on Alabama, won for state reporting. The Reuters team revealed the widespread use of migrant children for illegal labor at factories that supply auto parts to Hyundai and Kia, as well as at chicken plants.
The health reporting award went to Kendall Taggart, John Templon, Anthony Cormier and Jason Leopold of BuzzFeed News for their investigation into the dire conditions at a chain of group homes for people with disabilities after it was bought by KKR, a private equity firm.
Ian Allison and Tracy Wang from the online cryptocurrency publication CoinDesk won the financial reporting honor for their work in exposing problems in the relationship between Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange FTX and his trading firm, Alameda Research. The article set in motion the rapid implosion of both firms, and days later, FTX filed for bankruptcy. FTX customers and traders have lost billions of dollars, and Mr. Bankman-Fried is facing federal fraud charges.
A six-part series, “The Amazon, Undone,” by Terrence McCoy of The Washington Post, won the environmental reporting prize. It illuminated the ways in which Brazil has failed to protect the rainforest, pushing it to the brink of destruction.

The justice reporting award went to Brett Murphy of ProPublica for his investigation into the pseudoscience of “911 call analysis,” which claims to assess a caller’s guilt based on speech patterns. His articles pointed to more than 100 cases in 26 states where the technique was used in criminal cases.
The prize for political reporting went to Sarah Blaskey, Nicholas Nehamas, Ana Ceballos, Mary Ellen Klas and the staff of the Miami Herald for their articles examining how refugees were lured under false pretenses onto flights from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts, under the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
The foreign television award went to Sharif Abdel Kouddous, Kavitha Chekuru and Laila Al-Arian for “The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh,” a segment on Al Jazeera English’s Fault Lines program. The team examined the shooting death by the Israeli military of Ms. Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist who was reporting in the West Bank.
Shimon Prokupecz, a senior crime and justice correspondent for CNN, and his crew were honored for national television reporting for their coverage of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers, and of law enforcement’s delay in challenging the gunman.
A special award was given to Theo Baker, a student at Stanford University and a reporter for The Stanford Daily, for uncovering allegations that some research papers co-written by Stanford University’s president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, contained manipulated images. The university is now investigating the allegations. Mr. Baker, 18, is the son of two journalists — Peter Baker of The New York Times and Susan B. Glasser of The New Yorker, and is the youngest recipient of a Polk Award, according to Mr. Darnton.

2023-02-21,"When Celeste Polanco amassed 100,000 followers on TikTok, she started thinking about money.
“I knew I was in the position to get brand deals,” said Ms. Polanco, a lifestyle content creator in Brooklyn. “I just didn’t know anything about the business side of things.”
So Ms. Polanco, 30, was intrigued when a representative of the Carter Agency, a talent agency for TikTok creators, contacted her in 2021. She liked the energy she got from Ben Popkin, an agency representative, during their first meeting, which was via video. “I told him my boundaries and how much I think I am of value as an influencer new in the space,” Ms. Polanco said, adding that Mr. Popkin indicated her value was higher than what she thought.
She signed a contract.
Ms. Polanco’s story is not uncommon for many people who have embraced TikTok in the last few years and found themselves blessed by the mysterious algorithm that serves up their videos to vast numbers of users. The path from fame to fortune on the platform is being charted in real time, often on TikTok itself. Most users make no money; the ones who do typically earn it by promoting brands and products. Talent agencies can help negotiate those deals.
Now, more than a year after signing with the Carter Agency, Ms. Polanco says it never paid her for several deals she completed while working with the agency. According to documents provided to The New York Times, the Carter Agency negotiated deals on her behalf for at least $10,000, none of which, Ms. Polanco said, she has received. Ms. Polanco is one of two dozen creators who recounted similar allegations against the agency to The Times, including withholding money and concealing the rates of brand deals.

The Times attempted to contact the Carter Agency through emails, texts and phone calls for a response to these accusations, but the agency did not respond.
Niké Ojekunle was among the first creators to speak out about the agency, on TikTok and on the podcast “Women in Influencer Marketing” in November.
On TikTok, Ms. Ojekunle accused the agency of claiming to represent her in an attempt to sign another creator. She said she has never signed with any manager in her decade in the influencer business.
From Pranks to Profits
The Carter Agency was founded by Josh Popkin, who worked with Ben Popkin, his brother, and a handful of other managers. They represented dozens of TikTokers, and an archived version of the agency’s since deleted website lists “strategic partners” including Netflix, Amazon, McDonald’s and the N.F.L. (A representative for Amazon denied that it was ever a “strategic partner” of the agency. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.)

Before starting the agency, Josh Popkin was a TikTok creator. His account, which had more than three million followers, made headlines in the spring of 2020 for a video in which he dumped a tub of cereal and milk on the floor of a New York City subway car.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority called the stunt “despicable,” citing its impact on essential workers keeping the subways running as the pandemic raged. Mr. Popkin apologized in a now private video on his YouTube channel; he also deleted the TikTok account where the video originally appeared.
Managers with the agency would frequently send their clients a statement of work after securing a brand deal. These documents, common in the industry, detailed project deadlines, pay rates and the type of videos the creators were required to make.
Agencies, like the Carter Agency, make money by taking a percentage of creators’ earnings. Documents reviewed by The Times indicated that creators typically agreed to the agency taking 20 percent to 30 percent, with the rest going to the creator. But many said they received far less, or weren’t paid at all.
Timisola Ogunleye, a 27-year-old creator who signed with the agency in 2021, said it brought her deals with Clean & Clear and Neutrogena, among other brands. She accepted the agency’s 30 percent fee, but the rate felt high to Ms. Ogunleye, who also works in casting and production. “I still have a career that I’m focusing on,” she said. “So it was either they take 30 percent or I get nothing at all.”
Riri Bichri, a creator best known for her 2000s nostalgia parody videos, joined the agency in 2022. She said that she hoped she “signed a decent contract, which I didn’t, and I was hoping that I was working with generally honest people, which I wasn’t.” The experience, she said, “made me realize that it was very easy to do so because it’s so new, it’s so unregulated.”

Arielle Fodor, 30, a kindergarten teacher turned TikTok star better known as Mrs. Frazzled, has been using a spreadsheet to track the money she said she is owed by the agency. According to emails provided to The Times, one brand told Ms. Fodor it had already paid the Carter Agency, six months earlier, for her work. Ms. Fodor showed The Times contracts that stated she was to be paid $28,000 for that deal. She said she had not seen a dime.
Other creators interviewed for this article, including Ms. Bichri, provided documentation showing the agency had negotiated deals on their behalf, for which they said they were never paid.
Ms. Fodor said the agency first contacted her in October 2021. The relief of having someone navigate the deals — she was in her first trimester of pregnancy — was worth the 30 percent commission, she said: “It’s overwhelming, you know, when you’re getting influencer deals for the first time.”

Multiple creators have also accused the Carter Agency of preying on creators of color.
Domenica Comai, a creator in Los Angeles who worked with the agency for more than a year beginning in 2021, said she thought Josh Popkin “was mainly targeting Black people, people of color, and I think, in general, maybe also people that were more vulnerable.”
Ms. Comai started a group chat in November 2022 with about a dozen creators who say they were also exploited by the Carter Agency. All the chat members are women, including Ms. Ogunleye, Ms. Bichri and Ms. Fodor. A majority of the group members are women of color. (A majority of the people who spoke with The Times for this article are also creators of color.)

Crystal Scruggs, a creator in Houston, said Ben Popkin had cited the struggles of Black creators while trying to sell her on joining the agency when he called her in August 2022. “When we talked that day on the phone, he was just saying, you know, like, ‘Being a Black creator, you all deserve this,’ and, like, ‘I want to make sure that people are equally being compensated correctly in the influencer world.’”
Ms. Scruggs, along with Ms. Ojekunle, previously spoke with Fast Company about her experience. She said she completed only one deal while working with the agency.
Peter Rodriguez, a 27-year-old creator in Tampa, Fla., makes TikToks with his twin brother, also named Peter Rodriguez. (Their father and a third brother also share the same name.)
The Rodriguez brothers began working with the Carter Agency at the beginning of 2022. Mr. Rodriguez said the pay they received was far from the $18,000 to $25,000 for a single TikTok post that Ben Popkin described in one of his initial emails. (The email was reviewed by The Times.)
Despite this, Mr. Rodriguez was excited to be getting paid anything, he said, because he usually did videos for free. He said he dreamed of earning enough to quit his day job and focus on TikTok.
In September 2022, the brothers received a statement of work from the agency for a deal with a deodorant brand. The rate, according to a document provided to The Times, was $350 for three TikTok videos.

The brothers later signed a new contract directly with the brand: $16,000 for two videos, according to a contract reviewed by The Times.
And while stories of agencies swooping in to sign young, often inexperienced talents are familiar — the music industry, for one, is littered with contract-related lawsuits — the newness of TikTok and the opacity of the influencer economy make people like Mr. Rodriguez particularly susceptible.
Alexis Farkas, 28, said she worked for the agency for two months in 2022 doing influencer scouting. Josh Popkin emphasized finding creators without managers, said Ms. Farkas, who lives in Newtown, Pa.
A TikTok Warning
Last November, Ms. Ojekunle, a popular creator known online as Specs & Blazers, posted a video in which she accused the Carter Agency of numerous wrongdoings.
She was not the first. In January 2021, Stephen Odea, known online as Stephen Alexander, created a TikTok account called @TheCarterAgency and posted two videos; in one of them he wrote that the agency took advantage of clients.
Ms. Ojekunle’s video, and her subsequent videos, have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. In one, she described her surprise when a creator contacted her in the fall of 2021 asking if she liked being represented by the Carter Agency. Ms. Ojekunle had worked with the agency on individual deals but said she had never signed a contract for the agency to manage her. She believes the agency was using her name to recruit others.

In the fall of 2022, Ms. Ojekunle received an email from Jesse Greenspun at Malibu Marketing Group, another business started by Josh Popkin. In the email, which was reviewed by The Times, Mr. Greenspun said he was working with the skin care brand Naturium and had a potential business opportunity for her.
Ms. Ojekunle said she later spoke with Susan Yara, the founder of Naturium. Ms. Yara said Mr. Greenspun had identified himself to Naturium as Ms. Ojekunle’s manager.
“I worked for the Carter Agency and Malibu Marketing Group as an hourly contractor but left in November,” Mr. Greenspun wrote in an email to The Times. He denied representing himself as Ms. Ojekunle’s manager.
After Ms. Ojekunle’s video gained traction, Ben Popkin sent an email to Carter Agency clients. In it, he called her statements “inaccurate” and wrote that Ms. Ojekunle had been signed by the agency but was dropped for being “unprofessional” and failing to deliver materials. Ms. Ojekunle denied these claims.
The email spurred some creators who had worked with the agency to pore over their own contracts. Many creators contacted brands to learn if they had been paid correctly for their work. Eric Fishbin, Ms. Scruggs’s former manager, quit after seeing the video, according to an email provided to The Times. “I never knowingly provided inaccurate information to a client,” he wrote in an email.

An Unclear Path
“It’s good to just have a group that fully understands what’s going on,” Yasmine Sahid, a 26-year-old creator in Los Angeles, said of Ms. Comai’s group chat. She had a lawyer send a letter to the agency in January demanding almost $50,000 in outstanding payments and asking for proof of a talent agency license.
The agency has not responded.
Deciding what to do next is complicated. Ms. Fodor contacted the Federal Trade Commission and said the man who answered the phone recognized her voice from social media and talked with her about his wife, who also worked in education. “And then he was like, ‘This isn’t the right person to call. Sorry!’” Ms. Fodor said. She eventually found a lawyer, who is now working with some members of Ms. Comai’s group chat.
Some creators, like Kaity Dennis, are frustrated but aren’t sure if the cost of legal action will cancel out any money they might recoup.
In November, Jahnesha Standley, a parenting influencer and former client in Jacksonville, Fla., texted Ben Popkin pretending to be interested in signing a new contract.

Ms. Standley, 28, had left the agency after a three-month trial earlier in 2022. She had recently learned that her former manager there appeared to have misrepresented the rate of a deal she had turned down. She didn’t really want to sign a new contract. She wanted answers.
Three days after Christmas, Ben Popkin got in touch.
“Hi Jahnesha,” he wrote in an email provided to The Times. “You sent me a text message previously regarding completing additional campaigns — are you interested in more collaborations? Thanks, Ben.”
Ms. Standley said she didn’t hold back in her response. “I went off.”

Vivek Ramaswamy has gone from professional E.S.G. critic to presidential candidate.

The case for fighting E.S.G. gets messy
Many Republicans have made railing against the environmental, social and corporate governance investing movement a cornerstone of their political success. (Indeed, Vivek Ramaswamy, the financier who rose to fame battling against “woke capitalism,” announced a long-shot bid for the 2024 G.O.P. presidential nomination yesterday.)
But that stance is growing increasingly complicated — especially given new revelations that lawmakers who have publicly berated companies for pursuing E.S.G. strategies have also taken big donations from those same businesses.
Bashing E.S.G. and left-leaning companies has been highly fruitful for Republicans. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, widely considered a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has scored political points for picking a fight with Disney over its opposition to his state’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law.
And he and other G.O.P. state officials have taken on investment giants like BlackRock, one of the biggest proponents of E.S.G. policies, and Vanguard, threatening to pull billions in state money from those firms over their support of environmental and social considerations in investing. Mike Pence, who may also run for president, last year accused “a few Wall Street financiers” of pushing a left-wing agenda that Democrats hadn’t been able to get approved at the ballot box.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
(Mr. Ramaswamy, who wrote “Woke Inc.” and whose Strive Asset Management has targeted Apple, BlackRock and Disney, has sought to capitalize on that stance in the business world.)
But the money trail complicates things. CNBC reports that 10 of the 29 Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee (including its chairman, Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina) took in a combined $140,000 in campaign donations from BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard during the 2022 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission filings. All three of those companies are regularly criticized by conservative lawmakers.
That’s on top of recent pushback in states like Kentucky against G.O.P. efforts to remove public pension funds’ money from firms like BlackRock.
Some Republicans are moving away from strident opposition to E.S.G. Among them is Mr. Ramaswamy himself, who wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last month that it’s actually acceptable for investors to support environmental goals, so long as they’re transparent about their efforts.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Stocks plunge on worries about bigger interest-rate increases. Markets in Europe and Asia followed Wall Street’s big tumble yesterday as investors grew concerned that strong economic data in the U.S. and Europe meant central banks would keep rates higher for longer. All eyes will be on today’s release of minutes from the most recent meeting of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee for clues about where it might go next.

Citigroup bucks the trend on C.E.O. pay. The firm awarded Jane Fraser a nearly 9 percent increase in compensation for last year, to $24.5 million. She’s the only Wall Street chief to get a raise, as rivals saw their pay remain unchanged or cut.
McKinsey reportedly plans to cut up to 2,000 jobs. The consulting giant is planning one of its biggest-ever rounds of layoffs, according to Bloomberg and other news outlets. The cuts are expected to focus on back-end employees who don’t interact with clients; they’re meant in part to preserve McKinsey’s compensation pool for partners.
Credit Suisse keeps falling after reports of another inquiry. Shares in the embattled Swiss bank were down again today, after Reuters reported that Switzerland’s financial regulator was examining comments by the firm’s chairman, Axel Lehmann, about client withdrawals in December.

Tech’s big shield may live on
A fundamental law governing today’s internet — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects social media companies from lawsuits over users’ posts — faced a big test yesterday in a highly anticipated case before the Supreme Court.
But those hoping the high court would move to curtail the tech giants’ legal shield were likely disappointed: Justices appeared skeptical that they could, or should, go that far.
Justices heard arguments for nearly three hours in a lawsuit filed against Google’s YouTube by the family of a victim of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. The plaintiffs argue that YouTube’s algorithms pushed Islamic State videos to interested users and that the company bore responsibility. (The Biden administration has largely argued in support of the family’s position.) Lawyers for Google argue that recommendation algorithms are neutral.
What’s at stake: Tech companies and their allies, as well as the original drafters of Section 230, worry that allowing exceptions could make sites with user-generated content — from Instagram and Twitter to restaurant review platforms and marketplaces — liable for every decision to present or not present third-party content.
Critics of Section 230 say the law is outdated and too broad, giving tech giants nearly unlimited legal protection.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The justices mostly suggested they weren’t ready to hold tech giants liable just yet:
Justice Clarence Thomas defended recommendations as a vital part of the internet. “If you’re interested in cooking, you don’t want thumbnails on light jazz,” he said.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh worried that imposing limits on Section 230 “would really crash the digital economy, with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you.”
Justice Elena Kagan cracked more broadly about how ill-equipped she and her colleagues were: “These are not the nine greatest experts on the internet.”
That doesn’t mean the Supreme Court favors the status quo. Kagan noted that Section 230 was a “pre-algorithm statute” that offered little guidance in “a post-algorithm world.” And Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether algorithms were truly neutral, since the formulas are “designed to maximize profits,” implying that companies are making decisions that could incur liability.
Ultimately, several justices suggested, this wasn’t a matter for the courts, but for Congress.
Microsoft draws red lines in its deal fight
After testifying yesterday in Brussels about Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover bid for Activision Blizzard, the tech giant’s president, Brad Smith, issued a challenge to regulators: Don’t try to force Microsoft to divest parts of Activision in exchange for approving the deal.
Proposals like selling off popular games are a nonstarter, according to Mr. Smith. It isn’t “feasible or realistic to think that one game or one slice of this company can be carved out and separated from the rest,” he told reporters after he spoke with the European Commission.
It was a rejoinder to Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, which this month suggested that it would only approve the Activision deal if Microsoft chose so-called structural remedies, like divesting the popular “Call of Duty” franchise. (In the U.S., the F.T.C. has already sued to block the deal.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Smith pointed to less onerous concessions that Microsoft was willing to make. He noted that the company had just signed deals to give access to “Call of Duty” and other games to rival gaming companies, including Nintendo and Nvidia. Mr. Smith also reiterated that Microsoft was prepared to reach a similar deal with Sony.
It’s a bet that Microsoft can rely on what are known as behavioral remedies, where a company promises to address regulators’ concerns, instead of taking the more drastic step of selling off businesses. But it’s a risky gamble, given regulators’ increasing skepticism about anything short of permanent structural changes to avoid antitrust violations.
In other antitrust news, the F.T.C. said it won’t block Amazon’s $3.9 billion takeover of One Medical.
“Five days ago, the chart we shared showed nearly 350 of these submissions. Today, it crossed 500. Fifty of them just today, before we closed submissions so we can focus on the legit stories.”

A church’s hidden billions
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church, isn’t usually known for financial riches. But the church and Ensign Peak Advisors, a nonprofit that runs its investment portfolio, agreed yesterday to pay a combined $5 million to settle charges by the S.E.C. that they had illicitly sought to obscure its $44 billion in assets for nearly 20 years.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ensign Peak used a web of shell companies to hide its portfolio, an arrangement approved by the church, according to the S.E.C. Ultimately, it created 13 entities that filed regulatory disclosure forms with the S.E.C. that claimed they managed parts of the portfolio — even though Ensign Peak was the real manager.
Behind the move was the church’s concern that public knowledge of its vast holdings — by comparison, Yale’s closely watched endowment as of last summer was worth just over $41 billion — might discourage its members from donating, an Ensign Peak official told The Wall Street Journal in 2020.
The scheme first came to light via a huge leak of documents in 2018, when the website MormonLeaks disclosed the existence of the shell companies. The next year, the S.E.C. began an inquiry into the church’s finances. Ensign Peak began filing consolidated regulatory disclosures in its name in 2020.
In a statement, the church said it had relied upon legal advice in the matter and didn’t admit to or deny breaking the law. “We affirm our commitment to comply with the law, regret mistakes made, and now consider this matter closed,” it said.

2023-02-23,"Arinzé Kene
LONDON — Growing up in the then-modest neighborhood of Hackney here, Arinzé Kene and his four siblings were convinced they were going to be the new Jackson Five.
“We would learn dance moves from music videos and perform them in the living room,” said Kene. “It was the beginning of knowing I wanted to be an entertainer.”
Kene, 35, was chatting before a rehearsal of “Misty,” his almost one-man show (two musicians accompany him) that will arrive at the Shed on March 3. The piece, which mixes spoken word, music, surreal comedy and performance, tells a tale of gentrification, racial tension and male identity. But it also humorously stages the pitfalls a Black actor faces in telling this tale, via disapproving messages from his friends about racial stereotyping.
“Misty,” directed by Omar Elerian, is the sixth play Kene’s written, while his acting career has encompassed varied roles, including playing Bob Marley in the musical “Get Up Stand Up!” and Biff Loman in Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman.” The critics have swooned. “As much bumbling clown as muscular force to be reckoned with, by turns endearing and commanding,” Dominic Cavendish wrote of “Misty” in The Daily Telegraph after it transferred to the West End.

Kene, who exudes a combination of energy, focus and charisma, said he was “constantly creating” when growing up, writing songs and putting out mixtapes and an EP. But he began acting only after stumbling on a teenage drama group near his home. He was also a talented sportsman and academically accomplished; his parents, a taxi driver and a nurse, who had emigrated from Nigeria when Kene was 4, hoped he would become a doctor.
He tried to let them down gently. “Even after I got a three-month gig in the Boney M musical, ‘Daddy Cool,’ they still thought I was going to university,” he said.
University didn’t happen, but regular acting jobs did, and at 21 he was playing a leading role in Ché Walker’s musical “Been So Long” at the Young Vic. That was the moment he began to believe in himself as an actor.
He was also writing, creating his first play, “Estate Walls,” during a writer’s course at the Royal Court Theater. He spent two subsequent years in a whirlwind of writing and acting while participating in more writing and directing programs.
“Misty” emerged from a 2012 commission from Madani Younis, then the director of London’s Bush Theater. (He is now the chief executive producer at the Shed.) For three years, Kene struggled to write, eventually offering to return the commission fee. Younis refused. Kene then “began to scribble” about his experience of moving back to Hackney, now undergoing rampant gentrification. “The music just started happening,” he said. “I didn’t always know where the story was going, but I suddenly had a wellspring of information because it was my upbringing, my home.”

Although Kene’s plays have all drawn on his own experience, he hadn’t previously appeared in any of them. But after the actor performed the piece (before a small audience of the Bush artistic team, in the theater’s kitchen), Elerian persuaded him to take on the role.
“I was self-conscious about it,” he said. “Why would anyone care about my experience? But what I learned is that specific is interesting, honesty is interesting. If it’s the truth, people may lean forward.” ROSLYN SULCAS

Talene Monahon’s latest play, “The Good John Proctor,” blends history and fiction to give voice to previously marginal figures or to connect historical events to our moment.

In Talene Monahon’s “Jane Anger,” William Shakespeare is portrayed not as an envy-inspiring wordsmith, but as a pompous misogynist struggling with writer’s block during a plague. “Every time I go into quarantine, I’m expected to be more prolific and timely than the last time,” he whines to his assistant.
Unlike her fictional Bard, Monahon had a most productive pandemic. Besides “Jane Anger,” she wrote “The Good John Proctor”; the Bedlam theater company production of the show begins previews March 12 at the Connelly Theater. Billed as a “prequel” to “The Crucible,” the play is a reimagining of the events leading up to the Salem Witch Trials, as experienced by four girls who spend much of their time discussing one another’s menstrual cycles and mysterious dreams.

It also hints at darker themes. “I’m interested, for the purposes of the play, in childhood and girlhood and how trauma manifests in a society where there is no language for it and only language about the devil and witchcraft,” Monahon said over a video call earlier this month.
“The Good John Proctor” shares DNA with Monahon’s other plays, which thoroughly emulsify history and fiction to give voice to previously marginal figures or to connect historical events to our moment.
“I think about this quote from Hilary Mantel all the time: ‘History is not the past — it is the method we have evolved of organizing our ignorance of the past,’” she said.
Monahon, 32, who grew up in Belmont, Mass., attended Dartmouth College and now lives in Brooklyn, attributes her interest in history to her Armenian heritage. Family members had lived through the Armenian genocide, and she grew up with an awareness that historically grand narratives have a way of eliding certain events. “From an early age, I was interested in what histories get taught, what doesn’t get taught, who teaches history, who controls the narrative,” she said.
Writing came relatively late to Monahon. As a child, she performed in musicals at her Unitarian Universalist church, and her professional acting credits have included productions at Roundabout Theater Company (“Bobbie Clearly”) and Playwrights Horizons (“Log Cabin”). “Writing was always something I kind of just did for myself,” she said.

The chance to do more of it presented itself during the pandemic, when Monahon worked on virtual playlets for the 24 Hour Plays. She likened the experience to going to graduate school for playwriting. “I started figuring things out for myself about structure and form,” she said, “and I think that my writing improved.”
“The Good John Proctor” began its life as an exercise there. She fleshed it out with research — reading Stacy Schiff’s “The Witches: Suspicion, Betrayal, and Hysteria in 1692 Salem,” and traveling to Texas, along with Tavi Gevinson (who stars in the new play), to read through Arthur Miller’s papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.
Her play joins a few others, like Sarah Ruhl’s “Becky Nurse of Salem” and Kimberly Belflower’s “John Proctor Is the Villain,” that wrestle with the legacy of the trials and of Arthur Miller’s canonical play.
During the interview, Monahon stressed that her play is not a takedown of Miller’s. “There’s so much in ‘The Crucible’ that I love and there are also things that really frustrate me,” she said. “I feel excited to think about these events from a different angle.” RHODA FENG

Ryan J. Haddad’s newest show, “Dark Disabled Stories,” recounts his journey through a world that doesn’t always accommodate his disability or the disabilities of others.

Kandice Chavous for The New York Times
In his past shows, the writer and performer Ryan J. Haddad has ingratiated himself with audiences, using jokes to put spectators at ease. In his new one, “Dark Disabled Stories,” produced by the Bushwick Starr and which begins performances at the Public Theater on Feb. 28, he takes a different approach.
“I try to make disability funny so that non-disabled people can understand it and open themselves to it and realize that it’s not so scary, so dark,” Haddad says early in the play. “Not tonight. I don’t feel like it.”
A one-man show with a difference, “Dark Disabled Stories” recounts Haddad’s journey through a world that doesn’t always accommodate his disability (cerebral palsy, which requires a walker and leg braces) or the disabilities of others. The stories are his own — some he experiences as a protagonist, others he simply observes. But he is joined onstage by Dickie Hearts, who performs the same tales in American Sign Language, and Alejandra Ospina, who provides audio description. The theater also offers expanded wheelchair seating, making “Dark Disabled Stories” the rare show that is accessible to all or nearly all.
That’s a happy thing. But “Dark Disabled Stories” isn’t designed for uplift. It does not supply what Haddad, 31, refers to, with appropriate derision, as “inspiration porn” — tales of disabled people triumphing in the face of obstacles internal and external. He doesn’t believe that hope is what he owes an audience. What he owes them, he feels, is truth.
“We’ve been starved for stories about us,” Haddad said over breakfast in the lobby of the Public Theater. “What I’m telling, what I’m giving is a really honest portrait. And it’s a portrait of me.”

Nervy and emphatic, Haddad grew up in a Cleveland suburb, the youngest of three boys. His older brothers were star students and star athletes. But Haddad’s passion was theater, musical theater in particular.
While a student at Ohio Wesleyan University, he acted in the theater department’s plays, but he realized that if he wanted a more robust career, he would have to create work for himself. He debuted his solo show “Hi, Are You Single?” just after college and has written several other pieces, all of them autobiographical.
“Dark Disabled Stories” has some of the provocations of his earlier work. (The first story finds Haddad in a club’s restroom, a stranger’s hand down his pants.) But he has pushed himself to go deeper. The first time he tried out the piece, he could feel the energy in the room change.
“I knew it was a little relentless,” he said. “I also knew I should be able to tell the darker stories, without having you pitying me.”
That “you” implies an able-bodied spectator, but “Dark Disabled Stories” is designed to serve both those with disabilities and those without. For those without, he hopes that the work will urge self-inquiry about each person’s relationship to disability and the disabled. And for audience members with disabilities, the show offers an invitation to relate their own experiences to Haddad’s. But neither community is guaranteed an easy ride.

Andrew Cenci for The New York Times
The playwright and actor Guadalís Del Carmen was supposed to go to law school. At least that was her mother’s plan for her.
“She wanted me to go to Northwestern,” Del Carmen said by phone one morning this month, and laughed affectionately. “She was very, very specific about that.”
Born and raised in Chicago, the daughter of Dominican immigrants who were educators before they came to the United States, Del Carmen passively resisted the law school path. She took the LSAT without studying for it, lest she score high enough to get in.

But her new play “Bees and Honey,” scheduled to start performances May 4 at MCC Theater, offers her mother a consolation prize. Its heroine, Johaira, is a lot like Del Carmen: a sharp, funny, driven Dominican American living in Washington Heights, in Upper Manhattan. Johaira, though, is also a lawyer — passionate about her job, and stressed by it.
A comic drama, “Bees and Honey” focuses on the relationship between Johaira, a feminist prosecuting a sexual assault case, and her husband, Manuel, a good guy who is also, as Del Carmen says, “a low-key misogynist.” Talk of sexism was very much in the air when she started writing the play in 2017, the year of the Women’s Marches and the rise of the #MeToo movement.
“I’ve kind of always been interested in our interpersonal relationships during times of cultural shifts,” she said from Louisville, Ky., where she was in actor mode, rehearsing for “La Egoista,” a play by Erlina Ortiz. “And also, you know, I really wanted to see a love story between two people that looked and sounded like me.”
In 2012, seeing Dominican characters in “In the Heights” gave Del Carmen a life-altering jolt. Still living in Chicago, already an actor, she realized that playwriting was also a possible avenue. Her first play, “Blowout,” had its premiere in 2013.
As a Black woman of Latin American descent, she said she had never truly felt accepted in Chicago; people there routinely asked why she spoke Spanish, the language she’d learned at home. To them, she didn’t look Latina.

Moving to New York in 2016, she found a sense of belonging among the large Dominican community in Washington Heights. But she was surprised to find that Dominican playwrights weren’t being produced on the city’s English-language stages.
“Bees and Honey” is part of her effort to change that. The Sol Project, which elevates work by artists of Latin American descent, developed the play at its SolFest in 2018 and is co-producing the run at MCC.
Melissa Crespo, the play’s director, said Del Carmen’s artistry lies in her deftness at interweaving comedy with difficult topics like “mental health and misogyny and colorism.” There is also her ear for dialogue, which Crespo believes is “why TV is trying to scoop her up.”
Del Carmen spent last summer on the writing staff of an HBO Max prequel to Stephen King’s “It,” she’s been working on other projects with Amazon and FX, and she has already written the pilot of a possible TV adaptation of “Bees and Honey.” Her career has been going so well that it’s been more than a year since she’s worked at her fallback occupation: dental hygienist.
She isn’t certain that she’s hung that up for good, though; a screenwriters strike may be looming. But she’s positive she made the right call in snubbing a career in law to build a life as an artist instead.
“The funny thing is, when I was doing hygiene, I would get a lot of lawyers,” she said. “And not one of them was happy.” LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES"
2023-02-24,"SACRAMENTO — Stay in, the meteorologists had said. Historic blizzards are coming to California. There will be snowplows.
And yet, some things must be seen to be believed.
In Silicon Valley, in the hills above Los Gatos, Bart Giordano awoke at midnight on Friday to watch the snowfall piling up on the pine limbs and blanketing his patio lounge chairs, drifts like nothing he had seen in the area in his 46 years.
To the north, Danny Cullenward, an energy economist up with a fussy 4-year-old, looked out the window and saw lightning and heard a rumble and then glimpsed a distinct kind of falling slush that he recalled from his childhood in the Midwest. Snow is so rare in most of California that residents went deep into the weather glossary to describe it.
“Thundergraupel in San Francisco!” he joyfully tweeted, playing on a suddenly buzzy word for precipitation that is not quite hail or snowflakes.

“I was like a giddy kid before Christmas,” he later confessed.
California is a big place, and its high elevations and ski slopes are as snow-prone as those in the next state. Even the warmer parts of Southern California get an occasional dusting.

But snow is not the Golden State’s claim to fame, generally speaking. The storm is so extraordinary that it came with an almost unprecedented blizzard warning in Southern California for Friday and Saturday. State and local officials warned residents to stay off the roads and avoid the mountains, out of concern that many could be stranded in frigid conditions they had never faced before.

Smartphone Ban: Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a statewide ban on smartphone use in schools, joining a growing national effort to curb cyberbullying and classroom distraction by limiting access to the devices.
A Foreboding Fire: A wildfire that quickly consumed more than 14,000 acres northwest of Los Angeles signaled the start of what experts warn could be a dangerous and prolonged fire season in the West.
Tiny Homes: As the Supreme Court weighs whether cities can criminalize sleeping outdoors or in tents, Los Angeles is attempting to combat homelessness with tiny homes criticized by some as “inhumane.”
Already on Friday, the storm had forced the closure of the main north-south route, Interstate 5, at the Grapevine between Los Angeles and the Central Valley. At times, it caused vehicles of all sizes to spin out on various roadways.
Still, amid dangerous conditions and serious threats to motorists, many Californians emerged to see what fresh novelty the sky had dropped — and to take selfies, naturally.

Social media generated its own blizzard: snow days in Yucaipa, snow on the Bakersfield Cemetery tombstones, snow in the mountains in San Luis Obispo, snow on the Victorian homes of Eureka.
In the Santa Cruz Mountains, Melissa Leib was so struck by the winter wonderland outside her house that instead of her normal Friday posts about feng shui, she paid tribute to the “Freaky Friday” weather in her backyard.
Darshan Gooch, a well-known Santa Cruz surfer, had laughed out loud as snow fell on Twin Lakes State Beach, an “epic” moment he had pulled over to capture as he headed across town on Thursday morning to pick up some wet suits.
“I knew we had an unusual storm system coming through, but I was a little shocked when it actually happened,” he said on Friday. “It didn’t stick, but just to see it was beautiful.”

In Los Angeles, residents became obsessed with determining whether snow had actually fallen on the Hollywood sign. Some believed it had to be snow, while others said it was hail or even a more exotic form of precipitation.

The National Weather Service was on the case. “After a little investigating and with the help of the ALERT CA cameras, we are confident in saying snow or graupel fell on Mt. Lee (where the Hollywood sign sits),” the service tweeted Thursday evening.
By Friday morning, Eric Boldt, the warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Los Angeles, could confirm it had been graupel, which he defined as “basically snowflakes wrapped in ice.”
At that point, a brief flurry was again swirling around the Hollywood sign. Watching it through his window, Craig Robert Young, an English-born actor who has lived for 22 years in Los Angeles, three of them in the Hollywood Hills, said that the familiar sign had been coated in white the day before, as had his patio chairs and table.
“It was kind of bizarre,” Mr. Young, 49, said. “I wanted my husband to have a snowball fight.”

Kaan Ulupiner, 21, a University of California, Berkeley student, had rented skis for a weekend trip to Tahoe. But the main highway, Interstate 80, was closed in the Sierra Nevada because drivers were spinning out and blinded by snow.
What else to do but trudge up the Berkeley Hills behind campus and turn it into a most unusual ski run?
“I was feeling quite down this morning until kind of a miracle happened,” he said. “I was like, all right, guess I’m skiing one way or another.”
In the Central Valley community of Patterson, known for its apricots and its huge Amazon warehouse, the hills to the west are coated in white. Chuck Marble, 64, a retiree whose pastimes include following the weather on radar, said he had noticed on Friday morning that snow had fallen nearby and drove through a torrential rain to bear witness: “I said, ‘I’m not going to miss this!’”
By midday on Friday, the thrill was fading. In the lower elevations, snow had turned to rain, and in the higher ones, the heavy amount was starting to become worrisome. In Southern California, Mr. Boldt, the meteorologist, warned of winds of up to 80 miles per hour and white-out visibility in elevations higher than 4,500 feet.

In Northern California, Mr. Giordano, a father of three, said his family’s power had gone out as “at least a foot” of snow had accumulated, snapping off tree limbs and blocking ingress and egress.
“We’re on generator power with backup internet,” he said. “We’re stocked up with food, and the kids are out on their sled having a good old time. But what started as a very charming snowstorm is turning into, you know, how are we going to get out of our house?”

Good morning. I’ve been cooking out of the Italian American larder of late, with lots of sweet and hot pickled cherry peppers. There’s this ace recipe for pork chops in cherry pepper sauce (above) I picked up from the chef Mario Carbone, which I enjoy with a bowl of pasta. I love the peppers in Utica greens, too, and as a topping for a great fried eggplant sandwich. They’re terrific, as well, in this recipe for the chicken scarpariello, shoemaker’s chicken, that The New York Times Cooking team adapted from the one used at Rao’s in New York.
But today, I’m using them in a no-recipe recipe for a sausage Parm sandwich, to cook in the oven and devour in front of a screen. (Maybe watch “The Peripheral” on Amazon Prime?) A no-recipe recipe? It’s a prompt to cook rather than strict instructions for how to do so, a chance for you to stretch your skills, to make a dish your very own.
So: Italian sausages, puréed tomatoes, cherry peppers both sweet and hot, mozzarella, garlic, butter, hero rolls, basil. Roast the sausages in a small baking pan set in a hot oven with just a little bit of oil, so that they pick up a bunch of color and begin to crisp. Tear open and seed the cherry peppers and mix them with just enough tomato sauce to cloak the sausage, then add that sauce to the pan with the meat. Let it bubble and thicken for a while, then top with the cheese and allow it to melt and meld. Meanwhile, make some garlic butter, slather it into the heroes, toast them in the oven and fill with the Parm. Top with torn basil leaves and serve with red pepper flakes.

2023-02-28,"The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. Each month, we’ll choose three nonfiction films — classics, overlooked recent docs and more — that will reward your time.
‘The Fire Within: Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft’ (2022)
Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV and Vudu.
Sara Dosa’s “Fire of Love,” built from roughly 200 hours of footage made by the married volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft, was one of the past year’s breakout documentaries. It’s up for an Oscar at next month’s awards. But it wasn’t the only archival feature last year drawn from the Kraffts’ material. The other, “The Fire Within: Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft,” was directed by no less than Werner Herzog, and it too is worth seeing. Comparing the two movies makes for a fascinating case study in how directors can take divergent approaches to essentially the same assignment.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
While Dosa focused much of her movie on the Kraffts’ relationship and shared passion — she has described “Fire of Love” as a love triangle involving the two of them and the volcanoes — Herzog adopts a more cosmic perspective. The Kraffts fit neatly within his gallery of quixotic figures unintimidated by what, in “Grizzly Man,” he called “the overwhelming indifference of nature.” Herzog puts the Kraffts’ deaths — they were killed while observing the eruption of Mount Unzen in Japan in 1991 — up front, dwelling on video that shows them waiting at the volcano that would kill them and considering what they and other onlookers would have been thinking as the clock ticked down. He then runs down other narrow escapes that happened during their career. Over footage of an eruption in Alaska, Herzog, narrating as usual, marvels at how Maurice does not flee but instead calmly keeps the action in frame until he runs out of film.
Clearly Herzog sees the Kraffts as kindred spirits — fellow intrepid globe-trotting auteurs. (Near the end, he confesses that he would have given much if he “could have been their companion.”) And while “Fire of Love” was also concerned with the Kraffts’ evolution as filmmakers, and with the extent to which they played for the camera, Herzog’s perspective is more eccentric. As he contemplates how the Kraffts’ gaze became, in his estimation, less scientific and more humanistic, he is drawn to the material they shot of people and of animals, in clips that have no volcanoes at all. Nobody has ever filmed landscapes like them, he says. “Some of it has the quality of dreams.”
‘Good Night Oppy’ (2022)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
When the Oscars announced this year’s shortlist for best documentary feature, one of the more noticed absences was that of “Good Night Oppy,” the crowd-pleasing film that reconstructed the journeys of Opportunity and Spirit, twin Mars rovers that NASA launched in 2003. Both lasted far longer on Mars than scientists had planned for.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps one of the film’s techniques — using visual effects work from Industrial Light & Magic to depict Mars and the robots, because as advanced as the rovers were, they weren’t shooting a movie — struck voters as insufficiently purist. If so, that’s fair, but the alternative would have been far less fun. It quickly becomes tough not to anthropomorphize the robots in much the way that the scientists did. “It’s just a box of wires, right?” the camera operations engineer Doug Ellison says early in the film. “But you end up with this cute-ish looking robot that has a face.” It’s a face that will, on Opportunity’s 5000th Mars day, be featured as the subject of the solar system’s first interplanetary selfie.
While Opportunity stayed in service for more than 14 years, the director, Ryan White, and an extensive roster of NASA scientists and engineers recount how just how easily the rovers might not have lasted so long or gone so far. Even before they reached Mars, hazards found them: During the journey, they were beset by what we’re told are unprecedented solar flares that could have scuttled the mission. On Mars, each round of troubleshooting, as the rovers’ controllers on Earth figure out how to unmoor Opportunity’s wheels or how to get Spirit out of a rebooting loop, offers a fresh source of suspense.
The considerable time lag between commands and responses would only have made the breath-holding more intense on Earth. But given White’s considerable access to archival footage, and the accessible way in which his movie explains aspects of science, watching “Good Night Oppy” is probably the next-best thing to watching from the lab.
‘Last Flight Home’ (2022)
Stream it on Paramount+. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.
Unlike “Good Night Oppy,” Ondi Timoner’s “Last Flight Home” made the Oscars’ feature-documentary shortlist, but it missed the final cut of five nominees. It deserved to be there.
The film shows Timoner and members of her family as they prepare for the death of her father, Eli Timoner, who chose to die at 92 under California’s End of Life Option Act. Although the law has since been modified, when filming occurred, the act required a 15-day waiting period after the patient’s first oral request to a doctor for the medication. Timoner left cameras running during that period. And what sounds on paper like an uncomfortably invasive exercise becomes a powerful and moving portrait of a resilient, tight-knit clan collectively bracing for what’s coming.
ADVERTISEMENT

Partly, the film is a tribute to the warmth of Eli himself, a former airline president set back by a stroke at age 53. (At the time of his death, he had been partly paralyzed for nearly four decades, and also had congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.) Ondi and her brother, David, discuss the strangeness of the situation and of what they know they’re about to lose with Eli. “He’s the last of that generation,” David says. “You know, once he’s gone, it’s like that link to the past is gone.” Rachel, a rabbi, is to Eli both a grieving daughter and a spiritual counselor who helps him let go of lingering regrets. (When Ondi tries to reassure him during the ritual, Rachel stops her: “The exercise is not to give him narration.” There is always enough humor with this family to prevent the film from collapsing under the weight of its heavy subject.)
Through it all, it’s clear Eli is preparing for death on his own terms, surrounded by his loved ones. By law, multiple doctors have to sign off, and he must take the drugs himself. But “Last Flight Home” is more than simply a film about a social issue. It’s a profound, uniquely intimate portrait of the universal process of letting go.
2023 Oscar Nominations: Full Ballot
Here’s every nominee. Cast your vote and predict the winners."
2023-03-01,"When Bani Randhawa started wearing her new coat a few months ago, something funny happened: Strangers smiled at her as they passed. Babies in strollers pointed at her. Others stopped her on the street, all with the same question: Is that farfalle on your jacket?
“I have never experienced that while wearing another article of clothing,” said Ms. Randhawa, 27, who attends business school in Cambridge, Mass. The coat in question is the Rachel Antonoff Parker Puffer, a short, black jacket printed with golden images of bow-tie pasta.
In a sea of drab, black winter coats, the pasta puffer stands alone. “You are that girl when you wear it,” Ms. Randhawa said.
The coat has suddenly become a seasonal phenomenon in cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Social media is littered with photos of people posing in it. The actress Mindy Kaling has worn it. So has the actor Dylan O’Brien. The farfalle has become Rachel Antonoff’s best-selling print, and the jacket — which retails for $425 — has sold out three times since it was introduced at the end of 2021, said Ms. Antonoff.

“I feel like a winter coat with pasta all over it is a little bit of joy,” she said.
This winter, the pasta puffer has been especially conspicuous. Lauren Goldstein, 26, who works in social media and marketing in Manhattan and owns the coat, said this could be a result of the unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country, which allows for outerwear that prioritizes fashion over function.
The pasta coat is “my entire personality this winter,” she said.
It’s not unheard-of for outerwear to develop a cult following (see: the $100-ish Amazon Coat that took New York by storm in 2018). But the pasta puffer seems more niche.
“Before the pandemic, we were very often told, ‘This is way too loud, too much, this doesn’t merchandise,’ ” said Ms. Antonoff, who has been making food-themed garments like babka sweaters and dresses decorated with seafood towers since 2015. Then the lockdowns happened, and many people spending their workdays on Zoom calls were looking for a way to provoke conversation. “We noticed that people are being seen from waist up, and they wanted to have a big bagel on their sweater.”
The excitement for those styles has remained, she said.
Laura Nguyen, an account executive in Brooklyn Heights, said that during the pandemic she grew tired of her “bluish-gray professional clothes” from Ann Taylor. She decided to refresh her wardrobe, and at the end of 2021 rented the pasta puffer from the website Rent the Runway.
“Adding food into patterns and fashion is like the new florals,” said Ms. Nguyen, 25.
Sam Hwang, 25, who lives in Huntington Beach, Calif., and also owns the coat, said its popularity speaks to the way many people are more body-positive, and make their favorite dishes part of their identity. Other designers, like Lisa Says Gah and Susan Alexandra, have drawn attention for their food-themed fashion.

Rental companies have also played a role in the pasta puffer’s ubiquity. The coat has been rented more than 1,000 times through the clothing rental service Nuuly. On Rent the Runway, rentals of the coat grew by 10 percent from fall and winter of 2021 to the same period in 2022 — a rarity for any item of clothing, said Jennifer Hyman, the company’s co-founder and chief executive.
A bold jacket like the pasta puffer is ideal for temporary ownership, said Sarah Margulies, 29, a Boston-area lawyer who rented the coat in January. “It kind of only works once,” she said.
“You go to an event with the pasta coat, and you talk about the pasta coat. It is not going to be as impressive the second time you see it.”
But the effect the coat seems to have on people is undeniable.
Sarah Katz-Hyman, 33, who works for a nonprofit in San Francisco and rented the coat last spring on Nuuly, said it made her more extroverted. “It is nice to be able to put on a piece of clothing and Sasha Fierce it,” she said.
She missed the coat so much after she returned it that she posted on Twitter a video montage of herself wearing it, set to the plaintive Sarah McLachlan song “Angel.” Someone at Nuuly saw the tweet, and sent her a free coat.

“People were giddy when they saw me wearing it,” said Hannah Tate, 29, who works at a health-products company in Chicago. She rented the coat last December, and again in January.
Katey Ghobrial, who works in marketing at Yelp in New York, said a server at the Greenwich Village restaurant Minetta Tavern sat down at her table to discuss the pasta puffer when she wore it to dinner recently.
“I feel like a total celebrity,” said Ms. Ghobrial, 32.
But many pasta puffer enthusiasts also acknowledged the jacket’s downsides: It’s not very warm. It’s boxy. It’s expensive.
Alex Bruza, 31, an advertising employee in Los Angeles, rented the coat in December 2022, and said it was “not that flattering,” as it “jutted out on the bottom, and it made me look a little bigger.”
But with a coat like this, it’s not really about the fit. It’s about the joy.
“I was still obsessed with it,” she said.

2023-03-02,"The free market has assessed the value of the prosthetic hot dog hands that appeared in “Everything Everywhere All at Once” as $55,000 — or $5,500 per sausagey finger.
That price was determined in a weeklong auction that ended Thursday, in which the independent film studio A24 sold 43 lots of props and costumes from the movie. The reality- and genre-bending film, which is nominated for 11 Oscars, stars Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang, a Chinese American immigrant and laundromat owner trying to save a dizzying multiverse from ruin.
Bidders claimed the Elvis costume worn by the stylish villain Jobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu) and the lip balm that Evelyn’s husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), uses to zip between universes. Bidding peaked at $60,000 for an suggestively shaped “auditor of the month” trophy that first appears on the desk of an I.R.S. bureaucrat (Jamie Lee Curtis) but winds up somewhere else altogether. The Wang family’s laundry-delivery R.V. sold for $11,000 to a buyer who should not expect to drive it anytime soon.

“This needs new transmission, engine, tires and serious T.L.C. on the interior,” the lot’s description warned. “The R.V. is currently not street legal.”

No memento proved more desirable than a raccoon puppet nicknamed Raccacoonie that, at $90,000, was the auction’s highest-selling item. The puppet figures in a recurring gag about Disney and Pixar’s “Ratatouille,” one of several eclectic cinematic references dotted throughout by the film’s directors, Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan.
Proceeds from the auction, which totaled $555,725, will be donated to three organizations: the Asian Mental Health Project, which aims to make mental health care more accessible in Asian American communities; the Transgender Law Center, which champions the rights and safety of transgender and gender-nonconforming people; and the Laundry Workers Center, which works to improve conditions for laundry, warehouse and food service workers. A24 declined to release the names of the winning bidders.
Jason Kisvarday, the film’s production designer, said in an interview on Wednesday that he was surprised to see so many of the items going for thousands of dollars. “There’s usually not a lot of demand or interest in these types of things after the movie comes out,” he said.

The galaxy-brain nature of the film’s plot demanded equally absurd props and costumes, which have resonated with fans. The multiverse was made chic by the costume designer Shirley Kurata, while Mr. Kisvarday oversaw the department that bought or created most of the other items for sale in the auction.
Some were easier to procure than others. A pair of gloves for the hot dog hands were cut from a sweater and hot-glued together by Allison Trautman, the art department coordinator. An umbrella covered in doughnuts was secured by Joshua Bramer, the prop master. The hot dog hands themselves, along with Raccacoonie, were created by the special effects and makeup artist Jason Hamer.
Mr. Kisvarday took other projects into his own, non-hot-dog-shaped hands. He visited a stone supplier in Pasadena, Calif., with the film’s directors to select about 10 rocks that at one point replace the human characters. They were looking for “neat and interesting” rocks that could be thrown down a hill, he said.

One of them, accessorized with googly eyes that Mr. Kisvarday ordered from Amazon, sold on Thursday for $13,200. “It’s not because it’s a rock,” he said, “it’s because of how many people saw the rock, are excited about this rock, and it means something to them.”
In addition to its charitable goals, the auction also advances A24’s efforts to build a recognizable brand with cultural cachet. Since the studio was founded in 2012, it has been responsible not just for hits (“Euphoria,” “Lady Bird”) but also for a growing offering of beanies and hoodies meant to appeal to the Letterboxd and Criterion Collection crowd. The studio has previously auctioned off items from “Midsommar” and “Uncut Gems,” including, yes, an “iced out” Furby pendant.

The auction generated buzz for the film during an awards season in which it has become an unexpected heavyweight. The film picked up honors at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards, and leads the pack with 11 Oscar nominations, including for best picture, best director, best actress (Ms. Yeoh), best supporting actress (Ms. Hsu and Ms. Curtis) and best supporting actor (Mr. Quan).
Awards season has been “absolutely bonker-pants,” Mr. Kisvarday said.
Although Mr. Kisvarday expected many of the items in the auction to be sold to private collectors, he said he hoped that some, like the family R.V., would land somewhere publicly accessible like a museum.
“I think it’s fun when mementos like this wind up in places where many people can see and enjoy them,” he said."
2023-03-03,"In recent weeks, two members of Congress have sounded the alarm over the dangers of artificial intelligence.
Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times in January that he was “freaked out” by the ability of the ChatGPT chatbot to mimic human writers. Another Democrat, Representative Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, gave a one-minute speech — written by a chatbot — calling for regulation of A.I.
But even as lawmakers put a spotlight on the technology, few are taking action on it. No bill has been proposed to protect individuals or thwart the development of A.I.’s potentially dangerous aspects. And legislation introduced in recent years to curb A.I. applications like facial recognition have withered in Congress.
The problem is that most lawmakers do not even know what A.I. is, said Representative Jay Obernolte, a California Republican and the only member of Congress with a master’s degree in artificial intelligence.

“Before regulation, there needs to be agreement on what the dangers are, and that requires a deep understanding of what A.I. is,” he said. “You’d be surprised how much time I spend explaining to my colleagues that the chief dangers of A.I. will not come from evil robots with red lasers coming out of their eyes.”
The inaction over A.I. is part of a familiar pattern, in which technology is again outstripping U.S. rule-making and regulation. Lawmakers have long struggled to understand new innovations, once describing the internet as a “series of tubes.” For just as long, companies have worked to slow down regulations, saying the industry needs few roadblocks as the United States competes with China for tech leadership."
2023-03-04,"“Events really did change. We did have a pandemic, remote work became a thing. But I think this is yet another cautionary tale, perhaps the ultimate cautionary tale, of not betting a whole community on a company.”

2023-03-05,"The Academy Awards are still a week away, but at least one verdict is in: “Tár” is a hit, having already won some 60 international awards and six Oscar nominations, including for best picture, best directing and best actress in a leading role. It has also engendered passionate conversations, articles and interpretations.
The film, written and directed by Todd Field, stars Cate Blanchett as the fiercely ambitious conductor Lydia Tár. Throughout the film we are never sure what is “real” and what is imagined. She is constantly sanitizing her hands and popping pills and frequently walking in her sleep. Like Lady Macbeth, she is a work of fiction.
But some of my fellow conductors, as well as a few music critics, aren’t so happy. Some of their objections are aesthetic; some refer to errors of jargon, like calling Mahler’s Fifth Symphony “the Mahler Five.” One conductor in particular is more personal: “I was offended as a woman,” wrote Marin Alsop. “I was offended as a conductor, I was offended as a lesbian.”
Not too many years ago, the funny and freewheeling Amazon Prime series “Mozart in the Jungle,” which ran for four seasons, depicted classical musicians engaging in a whole range of morally questionable behaviors. No one in the classical music community, as far as I can find, complained or took any of it too seriously. Real classical music stars such as Lang Lang, Alan Gilbert and Joshua Bell appeared in the series alongside the cast of actors. Even Gustavo Dudamel — now the incoming music director of the New York Philharmonic — showed his good sense of humor by making a cameo appearance as a stage manager. By the final season, the fictional musician Hailey Rutledge, played by the actress Lola Kirke, had become a conductor (Episode 2: “Hailey Continues to Lie About Her Current Career Path”). So if a thoroughly irreverent show like that didn’t raise a false upbeat, what’s the uproar over “Tár” really about?
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Many of the complaints within the classical music community seem to grow out of a concern that if you write a fictional drama depicting unsavory characters (Lydia is accused of abusing a young female student — though that is never proved in the film), the members of the moviegoing public who don’t generally attend classical concerts will be driven even further away.
But audiences are smarter than that. “Tár” was released on Oct. 7, 2022. That month streams of Mahler’s Symphony No. 5 — a work that looms large in the film as one Lydia has yet to record with a major orchestra — were up 150 percent from the previous month, according to data provided by Apple. Compared with the previous October, that number had more than tripled. Streaming of Mahler’s Fifth also jumped on Spotify after the release of the film. The “Tár” concept album on Deutsche Grammophon hit No. 1 on the Billboard classical charts. And you can count on it: When my friend Marin Alsop next conducts Mahler’s Fifth, the press will celebrate what surely will be a brilliant performance — and also refer to “Tár.”"
2023-03-06,"A24, the independent film and television studio barreling into next weekend’s Academy Awards with a boatload of Oscar nominations, is making an unexpected move into live performance, purchasing a small Off Broadway theater in New York’s West Village.
The studio, which until now has focused on making movies, television shows and podcasts, has purchased the Cherry Lane Theater for $10 million, and plans to present plays as well as other forms of live entertainment there, in addition to the occasional film screening.
A24, whose films include the leading Oscar contender “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” is not the first film studio to make such a move: the Walt Disney Company has been presenting stage productions at Broadway’s New Amsterdam Theater, which it leases from the state and city, since 1997. But Disney, of course, is an entertainment industry behemoth that has mastered the art of multiplatform storytelling.
A more comparable move, perhaps, was that by Audible, an Amazon audio subsidiary that since 2018 has been leasing the Minetta Lane Theater, in Greenwich Village, for live productions which it then records and offers on its digital platform. And Netflix, the streaming juggernaut, has in recent years taken over several cinemas, including the Paris Theater in New York, as well as the Egyptian and Bay theaters in Los Angeles.
The A24 acquisition, coming at a time when many theaters are still struggling to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, suggests a vote of confidence in live performance. A24 plans to present some events celebrating Cherry Lane’s centennial this spring, and then to close the theater for renovations before beginning full-scale programming next year.
More on N.Y.C. Theater, Music and Dance
Staging a Broadway Fight Club: A brutal and bloody scene has been captivating audiences at the Broadway musical “The Outsiders.” Here’s how they did it.
A Return to the Met: The Metropolitan Opera is approaching prepandemic levels of attendance. But its strategy of staging more modern operas to lure new audiences is having mixed success.
‘Suffs’ Has a New Tune: A reworked opening number, less historical bulk and a general push to “have fun with these women” helped the Tony-nominated musical find its way.
Shakespeare Out on the Town: Central Park’s Delacorte Theater is being renovated, so a musical version of “The Comedy of Errors” is touring some of New York City’s outdoor spaces.
Much remains uncertain about how the company intends to use the theater. A24 declined to make anyone available to speak on the record about the acquisition, but an official there said that the company had not yet decided whether it would develop work for the stage, or present work developed by others. The official, who was granted anonymity to describe the company’s plans, said that the studio hoped the theater would allow it to strengthen existing relationships with writers and performers who work on stage and screen, and to develop new relationships with comedians and theater artists.

Hello! I’m Catrin. I cover biodiversity for the Climate and Environment team here at The Times. Sometimes people forget that latter part of our name, with so much focus these days on climate change. But we cover all kinds of environmental issues. Plus, the climate and biodiversity crises are deeply linked, and scientists say they must be addressed together.
The people behind Climate Forward invited me to make a guest appearance today to offer a new take on one of my recent articles, which looked at why some states can’t protect insects.
That lack of authority is a problem for at least two reasons: First, many insect species show alarming declines. Second, the rest of terrestrial life on this planet, including humans, relies on insects. Creatures like bees, butterflies and beetles pollinate plants, enrich soil and provide a critical source of protein for other species up the food chain.
Still, when it comes to insect conservation, at least a dozen states have their hands tied, legally speaking. The article I wrote focused on that.

But it’s not just insects and other creepy-crawlies, like spiders and centipedes, that get left out. In some states, authority over plants (not to mention fungi) is murky or nonexistent, according to Mark Humpert, director of conservation initiatives at the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.
Why it matters
Plants make the rest of us possible. In the words of Doug Tallamy, an entomologist at the University of Delaware, they “allow us, and nearly every other species, to eat sunlight, by creating the nourishment that drives food webs on this planet.”"
2023-03-08,"One of Wonder Woman’s fans wanted to pay tribute to his own personal wonder woman, his wife. So last year he asked Kross Studio, a Swiss luxury watch brand that specializes in pop culture themes, to make a custom timepiece.
Marco Tedeschi, the company’s founder and creative director, agreed — and now the brand is offering to make versions of the watch for other clients.
The design of the 45-millimeter tourbillon has several nods to Wonder Woman iconography from DC Comics, including the W logo that resembles a stylized eagle, which is affixed above the tourbillon cage. There are also representations of her Lasso of Truth and her shield; her tiara, which serves as the watch’s minute disk pointer; and her sword, the hour hand.
Incorporating all the motifs proved to be a technical challenge, Mr. Tedeschi wrote in an email: “In most watches, the dial is attached to the movement before being placed in the watch case. However, for the Wonder Woman tourbillon, the design dictated that half of the Lasso of Truth be fixed to the case and half integrated into the movement, making the casing process more challenging. We had to design a completely new movement, for a single piece.”

It took eight months to progress from the first technical study to the final model, he wrote, but the red, white and blue piece was ready in time for Christmas.
The titanium watch, which will be priced according to the customization, comes with three interchangeable straps: one in blue calf leather, one in red alligator and the third in gray goat leather.
For a less pricey gift, the brand’s website offers a watch case inspired by Wonder Woman — a vegetable-tanned leather watch roll that has been silk-screened with a DC Comics image of the heroine — for 250 Swiss francs ($266).
Kross Studio has collaborated with both Lucasfilm (“Star Wars”) and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products (a division of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns DC Comics, along with Harry Potter and “Space Jam”) to create watches and collector sets. “Our goal is to merge high horology and pop culture together to produce masterpieces,” Mr. Tedeschi said in an earlier phone interview.
There have “always been watches with cartoon characters and superheroes,” said Mark Bernardo, a former editor at both Marvel Comics and WatchTime magazine who was not involved in the Kross project, “but rarely have they been incorporated into the natural design of the watch, with elements true to the character.” Mr. Bernardo is now the director of editorial content for the online watch retailer Teddy Baldassarre.

“There’s a real sense that Kross doesn’t just throw a logo on a dial,” he said. “They appeal to not only serious watch collectors, but to serious nerds of these properties. They go the extra mile.”"
2023-03-09,"After hearing seven weeks of often-impenetrable testimony about television contracts, codes of ethics and the interpretation of Spanish phrases in emails sent more than a dozen years ago, a federal jury in Brooklyn on Thursday convicted a former Fox employee and an Argentine sports marketing firm of paying bribes in exchange for lucrative soccer broadcasting contracts.
Prosecutors said that Hernán López, who until 2016 worked for a unit of what was then known as 21st Century Fox, had taken part in a complex scheme to make millions of dollars in secret annual payments to the presidents of national soccer federations in order to secure the rights to the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana, widely viewed South American soccer tournaments. Full Play Group, the marketing firm, stood accused of similar but far more extensive corruption. Prosecutors said it paid bribes for the rights to World Cup qualifiers, exhibition matches, the Copa América tournament and the Copa Libertadores.
The government also argued that López had taken advantage of “loyalty secured through the payment of bribes” to secure inside information that helped Fox beat out ESPN in its bid for the United States broadcasting rights for the 2018 and 2022 men’s World Cups — a theory Fox has vigorously denied. Fox was never accused of any wrongdoing.
López, who holds dual American and Argentine citizenship, was convicted on one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of wire fraud conspiracy and faces up to 40 years in prison. Full Play was convicted on six fraud and money laundering counts and, as a corporation, could face financial penalties.
A third defendant, Carlos Martínez, who worked under López at Fox, was acquitted on counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.
The convictions represent what Breon S. Peace, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, called “a resounding victory” in the Justice Department’s sweeping investigation of corruption in international soccer.

Stream it on Netflix.
Every great kids’ movie needs a memorable villain, and Emma Thompson’s character in “Matilda,” with her yellow teeth and exaggerated physicality, is tough to forget. Adapted from the Olivier- and Tony Award-winning stage musical, this version of Roald Dahl’s beloved book gives kids someone to root for (Alisha Weir as the brilliant, telekinetic Matilda Wormwood) and a delicious antagonist in the form of a cruel, shoulder-padded boarding school headmistress named Agatha Trunchbull (Thompson). Matilda comes into the world like any cute baby — only, as she tells us in her introductory song, where other children’s parents say things like “She’s an angel,” Matilda’s tell her she’s “a good case for population control.” She finds acceptance via a teacher, Miss Honey (Lashana Lynch), and pushes back against the tyranny of Trunchbull, her parents and any adult who tries to crush her spirit. You might not want your kids to revolt in real life if it means they refuse to brush their teeth or go to sleep at night, but introducing them to a hero who’s a precocious little girl, rebelling out of a desire to be loved for who she is, sounds pretty good.
‘Turning Red’
Stream it on Disney+.
Domee Shi’s animated short film “Bao,” from 2018, won an Oscar; with “Turning Red,” Shi became the first woman to have sole directing credit on a Pixar feature. (It was also nominated for an Oscar.) The movie’s 13-year-old protagonist, Meilin Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), is a Toronto preteen in 2002 who plays the flute with gusto, loves school, has huge crushes and unabashedly adores a boy band called 4*Town. Unlike Matilda, Mei is close with her mom (voiced by Sandra Oh) and has every reason to be confident, but when puberty hits and she suddenly turns into an 8-foot-tall red panda every time she gets excited or emotional, Mei starts to doubt herself. Adults and older kids will recognize Mei’s transformation as the awkwardness of adolescence: a time when our bodies betray us and we just don’t feel like ourselves. Younger kids will just think it’s cool that a girl can turn into a big panda. They’ll also love the poppy 4*Town songs, written by Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell.

‘The Biggest Little Farm: The Return’
Stream it on Disney+.
Talking about the importance of biodiversity and sustainability might not wow young kids or keep them riveted, but adorable, tiny baby animals might. This sequel to John Chester’s feature documentary, which screened at Sundance in 2019, returns to Apricot Lane Farms in California, 10 years after Chester and his wife, Molly, bought a barren old lemon farm full of cacti, tumbleweeds and dust. The film was made with National Geographic, and some of the cinematography is stunning — think slow-motion butterflies and bees in flight, and the family dog, Blue, leaping through the air as he chases rabbits through rows of sun-dappled crops. Kids who have a soft spot for animals will fall for the 450-pound mama pig Emma, a lamb named Moe and, of course, Blue. With earnest narration (including lines like “It’s not just a way of farming — it’s a way of seeing”), this shorter follow-up to Chester’s earlier film can feel a little bit like an advertisement for the farm, but kids probably won’t pick up on that. If you want to give them a break from animated robots or talking monster trucks, “The Biggest Little Farm” offers a sweet change of pace.
‘Secret Headquarters’
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
Owen Wilson dominates the trailer for this superhero comedy, which was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and made for Paramount+, but it’s not really his movie. “Secret Headquarters” centers on his character’s preteen son Charlie (Walker Scobell), who thinks his father travels constantly to attend boring IT conferences, only to discover that he’s actually the most powerful superhero in the universe. When Charlie and his three friends find his dad’s secret superhero headquarters at the family cabin, they do what any curious kids with little to no impulse control would: They start pushing buttons, eventually summoning the evil Argon (an always great Michael Peña). Preteens might roll their eyes at the stilted dialogue and corny visuals, but elementary schoolers aren’t likely to be so discerning, so they might actually have some fun here. Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (“Catfish,” “Paranormal Activity 4”) are an odd co-directing team for a children’s superhero comedy, but there is plenty of action and just enough humor to keep younger kids entertained.

‘Dakota’
Stream it on Hulu.
Between Lassie, Old Yeller and Benji, there is no shortage of cinematic tales about the unbreakable, life-changing bonds between kids and dogs. Here, it’s an ex-military service dog named Dakota who helps a grieving widow in Georgia, Kate (Abbie Cornish), and her daughter, Alex (Lola Sultan), process their emotions and fight to keep their family farm out of the hands of a mean old sheriff (played by Patrick Muldoon, who hams it up for dear life). (As a Texan, hearing bad Southern accents onscreen is not my favorite experience, but as a sucker for dogs, I made it through.) Dakota belonged to Alex’s father, who was killed in Afghanistan, and when his Marine buddy brings Dakota to the farm, Kate seems a little too smitten with this handsome soldier, seeing as she just lost her husband a few months before. “Dakota” isn’t a movie for adults, though. It’s for kids who want to watch a sweet, loyal dog help a little girl and her mom. It might not become a classic like “Lassie,” but in a pinch, it’ll do."
2023-03-11,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — On Thursday night, in a bit of counterprogramming to the stream of gowns, jewelry and tuxedos of awards season, the organization Eco-Age drew celebrities out to the Green Carpet Fashion Awards, an event spotlighting those in fashion and entertainment who are embracing sustainable practices.
If you’ve looked closely at recent red carpets, you’ve seen changes taking shape, however small. Cate Blanchett, a co-chair of the event, has been known to repeat outfits. (At the SAG Awards, she wore an Armani gown that used upcycled lace from a dress she had worn years earlier.) In 2020, the actor Joaquin Phoenix made news by wearing the same tuxedo — designed by Stella McCartney — throughout awards season. Vintage is also becoming a more common sight.

It’s a bold look. What made you choose it? What makes anyone choose anything? It was a moment of inspiration. It’s looking in the mirror and thinking: “Hey, I’ve never done this before. This looks risky and challenging and outside my comfort zone.”
What’s your favorite eco-friendly practice? This is both sustainable and mentally very cathartic. I will take the time to clean out the Tupperware that comes from restaurants because you can’t recycle them properly unless they’re clean. So I’ll sit there scrubbing for like 25, 30 minutes. And then I look at all the plastic that I’ve cleaned. It’s a very wonderful feeling.

Look, my first stop is to always choose used materials. The second stop is to shop with sustainable designers. But sometimes I want to wear something to show you don’t need to wear skin — this is a vegan coat.
What’s your most important at-home sustainability practice? At home, the most important thing you can do for the environment is with your fork. I am a vegan for the earth and for animals.
What’s the oldest thing in your closet that you wear regularly? My jeans. I mean, I keep things until they’re dead or somebody tells me, “You have to throw that away.” When my mom passed, I took a lot of her clothes, and I’m wearing a lot of her jewelry and her clothes. I even have some of her underwear! I know that she would love it.

What’s the thing in your closet you wear the most? Oh, this Tory Burch suit that I got about three years ago. It’s a little jaunty brown corduroy set, and it’s really great trousers. I look a bit Oliver Twist, but with a happier ending. I really love a well-done suit. When I put it on, I feel like myself. I feel great. And it gives me a kind of power.
What’s a sustainability pet peeve you have? I get angry at wasteful packaging that’s meant to confer status of some kind.

If you were a designer, and you were making a sustainable outfit, what would you make? I think I would want to make something that celebrates different cultures. And then also to something that encourages people to mix and match it with pieces they already own in their closet.

Talk to me about what you’re wearing. I’m not a fashionista. I’m just not. So I won’t be coming to an event wearing somebody’s new dress. However, as I’ve been invited, I’m using clothing like a tool, with a message.
What’s your relationship to the sustainability movement? I’m not perfect — I’m going to be honest with you. I’m just like everybody else. I’m a bit of a consumer. But having said that, a great deal of what I wear is secondhand.

What are you wearing tonight, and how is it sustainable? The whole outfit is vintage. My stylist got it from a vintage store. And I liked the flowiness of this. This is an easy night — I didn’t want to do a suit and tie. This feels a bit more special.
What’s a sustainable practice that you do in your day-to-day life? Well, I’m trying to walk more. This is such a car city, where you have to drive. But where I’m at, I can walk to a local corner store, a convenience store, a grocery store. It’s a nice walkable area. It’s a way to build community, just less car and more walking."
2023-03-12,"To paraphrase Greta Garbo, give me back my slap.
No, of course onstage assaults are unacceptable. But the 95th Academy Awards could have used a jolt of some kind as they wound their way through three and a half hours on Sunday night. There was a crisis team in place to handle the fallout from any unexpected catastrophes like Will Smith’s attack on Chris Rock at last year’s show, but there was nothing it could do about the ordinariness and sameness of the ABC broadcast.
The audience in the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles roared for the early victories of sentimental favorites like Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis of “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (for best supporting actor and actress) and the late — very late — victories of the film’s writers and directors, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, and star, Michelle Yeoh. And their speeches were stirring. But at the end of the now endless awards season, we knew that they would be, and we had a pretty good idea what they would say.
There is now, through no one’s individual fault, a consistently promotional, exhortatory, shrink-wrapped feeling to the Oscars. After the depredations of streaming video and Covid-19, no chances are being taken. Jimmy Kimmel, reviving the role of the solo Oscar host, got off some good lines in his monologue — the movies are still distinct from television because “a TV show can’t lose $100 million.” (Though in the age of Netflix and Amazon, is that true?) But on balance it was safe, with the sharp jibes reserved for easy targets who weren’t there, like James Cameron and Tom Cruise. (“L. Ron Hubba Hubba,” maybe the best line of the night.)
Kimmel addressed Smith’s slap at length without really talking about it. He focused on what would happen in the extremely unlikely event anyone went rogue this year, pointing out performers in the audience whose screen characters were brutal enforcers — Pedro Pascal of “The Mandalorian,” Michael B. Jordan of “Creed III” and “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” It was an odd way to signal that violence was unwelcome.

In current fashion, the show opened not with a production number but a film montage, in this case a series of behind-the-scenes clips from nominated films. The attempt to hook audiences by bringing them inside the process of filmmaking and award-giving was also reflected in the deconstructed see-through set.

This contemporary feint toward inclusiveness — if they can’t nominate more female directors, at least they can make viewers feel as if they’re getting an inside look — contrasts, for better and worse, with the glossy insiders’ party that the Oscars used to be.
The surely unintentional effect, in a broadcast that sang the praises of the theater experience, is to make the movies feel smaller — more suited for the laptop screen and the Netflix interface. Winners don’t stick in the mind they way they used to. Did you remember that “Dune” took home six awards last year, twice as many as any other film? Or that “CODA” won best picture? (You’re welcome.)

In this context, the purely promotional segments on Sunday — a long plug for the Academy museum, a creaky salute to Warner Bros.’ 100th anniversary — felt right at home but also, in their reinforcement of the show’s lumpen unremarkableness, more irritating than ever.
And seemingly harmless attempts to signal virtue can backfire, as in Kimmel’s awkward and eventually condescending exchange with Malala Yousafzai.
As always, there were moments that pierced the veil. The victory of “Navalny” in the documentary feature category, while its subject, the dissident Alexei Navalny, languishes in a Russian prison, was indelible. Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Paul Dano were polished and funny in their presentation of costume design; the award’s winner, Ruth Carter of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” movingly invoked her mother, who had just died at the age of 101, asking the actor Chadwick Boseman to look for her in the afterlife. Yeoh, given carte blanche to emote, showed that feeling could be conveyed in an acceptance speech that was largely polished and non-self-aggrandizing.
David Byrne injected a welcome note of weirdness, if not musicality, in the performance of the best-song nominee “This Is a Life” from “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” The production number “Naatu Naatu” from “RRR,” Lady Gaga’s unplugged performance of “Hold My Hand” from “Top Gun: Maverick” and Rihanna’s rendition of “Lift Me Up” from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” were unimpeachably professional. But the musical highlight of the night was undoubtedly the snatch of the Carpenters’ “Top of the World” sung by the composer M.M. Keeravani when “Naatu Naatu” won best song.
When Kimmel wasn’t forced to ad-lib, he and his writers were generally on point. A call for audience votes on whether Robert Blake should be included in the In Memoriam segment was slyly handled. (He wasn’t.) A joke about the editing of footage from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol didn’t mention Tucker Carlson or Fox News but made its point.
The good moments, however, couldn’t change my sense that the modern Oscars have become something more to be endured than enjoyed. If you wanted a glimpse of the zeitgeist on Sunday night, HBO (“The Last of Us”) and TLC (“MILF Manor”) were the places to look."
2023-03-13,"POVERTY, BY AMERICA, by Matthew Desmond
Over the past decade or two, it has become fashionable to attribute major social ills to underlying “systemic” and “structural” causes. There seem to be several drivers of this tendency: the growing prominence of economists in public debates; the rise of the explanatory bloggers turned Substackers, who like to demonstrate their cool erudition by elevating intellectual arguments over moral ones; and the post-Ferguson racial awakening, with its emphasis on the deeply ingrained inequities that underlie present-day disparities.
The search for systemic and structural factors has much to recommend it in its attention to context and history. But it pushes to the side a crucial element: personal agency. If we can explain away so many problems as a result of larger forces — whether capitalism or racism or globalization or technology or countless others — where does that leave individual and corporate accountability? If everything is systemic, how can any of us be held to blame?
The sociologist Matthew Desmond stands in stark opposition to this prevailing trend. What made his previous book, “Evicted,” such a powerful depiction of low-income housing in American cities was, in great part, his decision to show how tenants in Milwaukee were struggling not only as a result of larger forces but as a result of specific acts of exploitation by those a rung or two up the economic ladder — the landlords, trailer park owners and payday lenders who were profiting from others’ desperation. In Desmond’s Milwaukee, there were good guys and bad guys and gradations in between, which lent “Evicted,” originally an academic dissertation, a compelling novelistic drive.

The insistence on personal agency is even more explicit in Desmond’s new book. “Poverty, by America” is a compact jeremiad on the persistence of extreme want in a nation of extraordinary wealth, a distillation into argument form of the message embedded within the narrative of “Evicted.” And the central claim of that argument is that the endurance of poverty in the United States is the product not only of larger shifts such as deindustrialization and family dissolution, but of choices and actions by more fortunate Americans. Poverty persists partly because many of us have, with varying degrees of self-awareness, decided that we benefit from its perpetuation. “It’s a useful exercise, evaluating the merits of different explanations for poverty, like those having to do with immigration or the family,” Desmond writes. “But I’ve found that doing so always leads me back to the taproot, the central feature from which all other rootlets spring, which in our case is the simple truth that poverty is an injury, a taking. Tens of millions of Americans do not end up poor by a mistake of history or personal conduct. Poverty persists because some wish and will it to.”
Image
This taking assumes many forms. There are the most obvious types of exploitation, such as employers paying undocumented workers less than minimum wage or denying them overtime; prisons charging inmates exorbitant fees to make phone calls; or banks assessing heavy overdraft fees. There is the winner-take-all nature of the tax code, under which, to cite only one notorious provision, private-equity partners are entitled to have most of their compensation for managing others’ investments taxed at the lower capital-gains rate, rather than as ordinary labor. There is the housing market, in which landlords are able to charge surprisingly high rents even in inexpensive cities to low-income tenants who feel they have few alternatives. “Poverty isn’t simply the condition of not having enough money,” Desmond writes. “It’s the condition of not having enough choice and being taken advantage of because of that.”
Desmond’s ideological allies on the left will nod along with many of these points. Where things get more interesting is when he considers the ways that upper-middle-class Americans, many of them proud progressives, are complicit in the taking. Affluent families benefit from tax breaks on their mortgages and college savings plans, leaving less revenue for programs that serve those in greater need. Consumers seek out convenience and low prices with little regard for the labor abuses that make them possible.
Most notably, homeowners in choice neighborhoods and suburbs defend exclusionary zoning that bars affordable housing, keeping low-income families at a safe distance from their streets and schools. This forecloses the upward mobility that comes with economic and racial integration and perpetuates the harms that accompany concentrated poverty. “Democrats are more likely than Republicans to champion public housing in the abstract, but among homeowners, they are no more likely to welcome new housing developments in their own backyards,” Desmond writes. In fact, he notes, one study found that conservative renters were more inclined to support a proposed 120-unit apartment building in their neighborhood than liberal homeowners. “Perhaps we are not so polarized after all,” he writes. “Maybe above a certain income level, we are all segregationists.”
What’s to be done? The usual left-of-center case for reducing poverty is to expand the safety net, and Desmond is on board with that, detailing how many billions could be found for that purpose if the wealthiest Americans paid their fair share in taxes. But he offers some cautionary nuance on this front. The U.S. safety net is, he argues, more generous than many on the left give it credit for: Between the earned-income tax credit, Medicaid, Pell grants, housing vouchers and a host of other programs, “there is no evidence that the United States has become stingier with time. The opposite is true.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The problem, Desmond concludes, is that we make it hard for many low-income Americans to access this support, and, above all, that so much of it is lost to the economic exploitation that is his chief target. And to address this exploitation, he calls for nothing less than an “abolitionist” crusade against poverty: a moral awakening that combats the scourge in ways big and small, through legislation, legal action and union organizing; through our decisions about what we buy, where we live and where we send our kids to school. “Becoming a poverty abolitionist,” he writes, “entails conducting an audit of our lives, personalizing poverty by examining all the ways we are connected to the problem — and to the solution.”
Why should Americans who benefit from the status quo be open to such a reckoning? Because, Desmond argues, we are in a broader sense all being immiserated by poverty. “It’s there in the morning paper, on our commute to work, in our public parks, dragging us down, making even those quite secure in their money feel diminished and depressed,” he writes. “Poverty infringes on American prosperity, making it a barricaded, stingy, frightened kind of affluence.” Some of us even experience an “emotional violence” from “knowing that our abundance causes others’ misery”: “It’s there in that residue of shame and malaise coating our insular lives; that loss of joy, the emptiness; our boring satiation, our guilt and nausea.”
Desmond’s case might have been strengthened by a more considered structuring and tone; at moments, the book can feel somewhat dashed off, lacking the deeply rooted heft of “Evicted.” His discussion of reduced life expectancy in struggling communities downplays the role of deadly violence, and he gives overly short shrift to programs that have tried to move low-income families to the suburbs and have demonstrated some success at boosting future income. The book would also have benefited from a direct confrontation with the claim, advanced by the New York Times reporter Jason DeParle and others, that social programs like the earned-income tax credit (which Desmond describes as “solutions to poverty but also stanchions of it”) have actually helped to significantly reduce child poverty.
But these are minor quibbles — a ragged edge is to be expected from a book that amounts to more manifesto than treatise. Desmond is well aware that his righteousness about our shared responsibility for poverty will cause discomfort: “People shift in their chairs, and some respond by trying to quiet you the way mothers try to shush small children in public when they point out something that everyone sees but pretends not to.” His purpose here is to draw attention to what’s plain in front of us — damn the etiquette, and damn the grand abstractions. As he quotes George Orwell: “We could do with a little less talk of ‘capitalist’ and ‘proletarian’ and a little more about the robbers and robbed.”

2023-03-14,"Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, the latest move to hew to what the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a “year of efficiency.”
The layoffs will affect Meta’s recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company’s website. The announcement is the company’s second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Mr. Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta’s hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing last March.
“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” he wrote.
Meta’s stock rose more than 7 percent by the close of trading on Tuesday.
Mr. Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured, and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Mr. Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.

2023-03-15,"Stripe, a San Francisco payments provider and one of the world’s most valuable private companies, said on Wednesday that it had raised new funding that values it at $50 billion, down from $95 billion in 2021, in a sign of how the air has come out of start-up dealmaking.
The start-up, which provides payment processing software to companies including Amazon, raised $6.5 billion in its new financing from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and Thrive Capital. Stripe, which said it didn’t need the money to run its business, plans to use the funding to help employees sell their company shares and cover the taxes related to their stock compensation.
“Current and former Stripes have helped build foundational economic infrastructure for millions of businesses around the world, and this transaction gives them the opportunity to access the value they’ve helped create,” said John Collison, a founder and the president of Stripe.
The fall in Stripe’s valuation reflects a difficult period for start-ups. Over the past year or so, as interest rates and inflation rose and the global economy began to soften, start-up funding — which had been fed by low interest rates and cheap money — declined. Many young companies have conducted mass layoffs and cut other costs. Last year, investments in U.S. start-ups dropped 31 percent to $238 billion, according to PitchBook.
Stripe had long been a darling of the start-up industry. In 2021, it surged to a $95 billion valuation after new funding, making it the most valuable start-up in the United States. But as conditions deteriorated last year, Stripe lowered its internal valuation 28 percent to $74 billion and laid off 14 percent of its employees, or about 1,100 jobs. The company explored a potential initial public offering of stock earlier this year.
Most recently, the start-up ecosystem has been rattled further by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, a key banking institution for venture capital firms and privately held companies. Federal regulators have taken over the bank, which has a new chief executive, Tim Mayopoulos, a lawyer who has steered several banking and financial technology organizations through tough times.
“They needed cash at a bad time in the market,” Angela Lee, professor of venture capital at Columbia Business School, said of Stripe. “Because they’re so big, it’s definitely going to move future valuations. If their valuation can halve, then so can everyone else’s.”
A Stripe spokesman declined further comment.
Stripe was founded in 2010 by the brothers John and Patrick Collison. It previously raised more than $2 billion from investors.
The new funding gives Stripe breathing room amid a tough market for public listings and also helps retain employees. Many privately held tech companies use stock options to recruit workers, but a quiet public offerings market has made it difficult for employees to cash out of those shares. Some Stripe employees have stock grants that will start expiring next year, which the new funding will help provide liquidity for."
2023-03-16,"There’s a new prime time in TV news: the afternoons.
The biggest draw on Fox News is not Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it’s “The Five,” the 5 p.m. chat show that, except for live sports and the hit drama “Yellowstone,” was last year’s most-watched program on all of cable TV.
In January, Ari Melber’s 6 p.m. legal affairs program outranked everything else on MSNBC — the first time in the network’s 27 years that a show outside the prime-time window of 8 to 11 p.m. took top honors. On CNN, Erin Burnett at 7 p.m. and Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. drew bigger audiences than the once-peerless evening lineup.
Twenty-four-hour cable networks have long fixated on the cult of prime time, when megawatt personalities like Keith Olbermann, Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow minted loyal fans. Anchors’ careers peaked when they landed a show at these most watched and most lucrative hours of the day.
Now, like almost everything else in the TV news business, that’s changing. Instead of flipping on CNN at 8 p.m. for the latest on the presidency or the pandemic, viewers are dipping in before dinner and then drifting away. Mr. Melber and Nicolle Wallace, who hosts a 4 p.m. show, expanded their audiences in the past year, even as ratings for most prime-time news shows declined or stagnated.

The reasons are myriad. Without the visceral urgency of a dangerous virus — or a sitting president who tweets erratically late into the night — America’s news obsessives may simply feel more comfortable changing the channel in the evenings rather than waiting on tenterhooks for the latest development. At the same time, prime-time stars like Ms. Maddow have moved on from their regular time slots.
“The biggest show on earth, the Trump administration, is over for now,” said Mosheh Oinounou, a former “CBS Evening News” executive producer. “It’s no different from traditional TV — the plot is less interesting, and some of the characters have left the show.”
Cable news is also facing its toughest competitor yet: streaming.
Americans over 65 are the core audience of 24/7 news channels, but these older viewers are increasingly turning to streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime for their entertainment. According to Nielsen, Americans over 65 watched nearly twice as many hours of streaming television in December 2022 as they did in December 2020 — the biggest increase among any age demographic in that period.
“Unless there’s something supercompelling going on in the world, prime-time viewers have so many other streaming options now to watch,” said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN and a co-founder of Hang, a streaming sports platform. “There’s so much more choice than there used to be. You can watch ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ on streaming. It’s hard for the news to compete with Maverick.”

For network executives, the trends have scrambled a few longstanding assumptions.

For one thing, prime-time hosts don’t necessarily have to be the omnipresent cultural figures they once were — and salaries can be adjusted downward accordingly. And the evening does not necessarily have to be reserved for reviewing the day’s news. Producers can experiment with documentaries and other nonfiction programming that may draw bigger audiences.
Typically, prime-time viewers tune in by appointment, expecting to see a familiar face discuss the news of the day. But CNN said last month that it would fill its empty 9 p.m. slot with a mélange of one-off specials and occasional cameos by unorthodox hosts like the former basketball star Charles Barkley.
The network’s new president, Chris Licht, has presented this strategy as bringing “fresh and unique perspectives to the news,” but it’s also a recognition that the appetite for current events in the evenings has waned.
CNN’s 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network’s highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Mr. Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot by temporarily moving Mr. Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks, and dismal ratings, Mr. Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, “The Lead,” now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN’s evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program “The Rachel Maddow Show” was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC’s prime-time viewership above that of Fox News — the cable news ratings king — in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.

But MSNBC agreed last year that Ms. Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, the political analyst Alex Wagner, has beaten CNN in total viewership, but her 2023 ratings are tracking about 30 percent lower than what Ms. Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Mr. Melber and Mr. Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC’s prime-time audience declined 21 percent from a year prior, and CNN lost 33 percent.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2 percent from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, “The Five,” is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, “The Five” leaped past Mr. Carlson last year to achieve Fox News’s biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Mr. Carlson still outranks “The Five” among adults under 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)

Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show’s success. “People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is ‘The Five,’” Lachlan Murdoch, chief executive of the Fox Corporation, said at an investor conference last week. “It’s a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics.”
“The Five” has also incubated two of the network’s rising stars. Fox News turned to Mr. Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its strait-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
“The Five” isn’t the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Mr. Watters’s 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Mr. Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ms. Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that, for generations, summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC’s “World News Tonight,” anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.

Mr. Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
“This is what we’ve been seeing for years,” Mr. Oinounou said, laughing. “People look for a digest of news as they’re about to eat dinner, and then we’ll send you to more traditional entertainment — written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington.”"

2023-03-18,"Sara Mauskopf’s day-to-day concerns — her customers, her employees, her own three children — don’t typically involve the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. She is the chief executive of Winnie, a start-up that helps families find child care and helps child care providers find customers, serving over 250,000 day cares and millions of families. Ms. Mauskopf, 38, has raised over $15 million for Winnie since its founding in 2016 and employs 29 people. All of her company’s money was in Silicon Valley Bank.
So when the bank collapsed last Friday, it suddenly became very important to Ms. Mauskopf what the F.D.I.C. did. Her company joined nearly half the venture capital-backed technology and science start-ups in the United States, which banked with SVB, worrying over whether they would have access to their money and be able to pay their employees. In the days since, Ms. Mauskopf has been cautiously watching how the bank’s failure might affect the economy — and rethinking where her company will keep its money going forward.
To explain what it felt like in real time to be a customer of the second biggest now-failed bank in U.S. history, Ms. Mauskopf gave The New York Times a rundown of the hour-to-hour changes, and her scramble to try to raise $200,000 for payroll in two days.

Or is this like, “I can wait and continue about my day?” That’s when I contacted other founders through groups I’m in on Slack and WhatsApp. I emailed back the investor who had told me about this. The consensus was that since our money in SVB is in what’s called a cash sweep account — basically, an account where cash is swept into a fund with more interest but low risk — it was safe.
If anything were to happen to our deposits, it was insured. I checked with our lawyers, who told me we could not pull money out of SVB without violating the terms of our venture debt agreement (a loan for early-stage, high-growth companies). I didn’t want to void that agreement because you lose the venture debt line.
11:10 a.m.
A number of people in founder group chats said they were leaving their money in SVB, and a number of people said they had wired theirs out. That’s when I decided to wire some funds to a different account.
I emailed my personal bankers when I was driving in the car. I pulled over and I wrote to them: “Hi folks, hoping one of you might be able to point me in the right direction. I’m hoping to move a portion of Winnie’s corporate banking.”
I knew the fastest way to get a corporate account would be with a bank who already had me as a personal account. I knew a lot of other founders had wired money into their personal accounts, which is something I didn’t feel comfortable doing. I wanted to have a corporate account set up before I wired money out. But by the time I got it set up, I was told the wire wouldn’t be transferred until first thing Friday morning.

FRIDAY, MARCH 10
8:45 a.m.
I didn’t sleep all Thursday night. I started texting with investors and they were telling me that people had actually gone to SVB branches to get cashier’s checks. I was like, “Wow, everyone got out except for me because I was doing my due diligence.” I am usually the fastest mover in a situation, but one of my resolutions has been to take more time to digest things before I react. I took all of two hours to digest, and it was too late. I missed the bank run.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
I woke up on Friday, threw on clothes and got to the SVB branch in Palo Alto at 8:45. It was supposed to open at 9 a.m. or 9:30. I drove to the branch where I knew another founder had gotten a cashier’s check. There were already Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation notices posted to the bank door saying it was closed.
There were a few other people there super early, and it was raining, and we were all walking back to our cars looking sad. The other people there were also super nerdy looking and I was like, “Yup, those are founders.” The four of us who were there didn’t talk because I was not in conversation mode.
9:30 a.m.
I looked at payroll. The transfer from the SVB account to the payroll provider, around $200,000, was supposed to happen Monday. I called Gusto, our payroll provider, and I asked: “Is this transfer going to work on Monday?” They were like, “Yeah, it’ll work, I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
Later on Friday, they sent a notice along the lines of: “Actually it won’t work, if your account was connected to SVB you better wire us the money you need for payroll.” That was really when I started realizing I needed to come up with this money.

I scheduled a call with our employment attorney for Saturday because I wanted to understand — could we miss payroll? I knew it would hurt my employees, but what do you actually do if you miss payroll? It turns out you can’t miss payroll, especially not in the state of California.
10:30 a.m.
I got on a Zoom call with my co-founder and our operations lead to discuss the full situation and all the things going wrong. Our credit card was with SVB and I knew those charges were going to start failing. I was like, “We’re going to have to move credit cards for all of these services.” I took a quick average — Amazon Web Services, software like Slack and Notion, Google — and I realized it was probably not going to be more than $10,000 on a given day for charges that come in.
It was not until Friday night or Saturday morning that stuff started failing on the credit card. We moved the charges to Brex. Then they got blocked on Brex. That’s when I started moving them to my personal cards. My husband is also an employee of Winnie. I said: “Hey, Eric, I’m going to be putting all these charges on our credit card. Don’t charge anything else. And by the way how much money is in our checking account? Because I might need to withdraw all of that to put toward our payroll.”
11:52 a.m.
I got on Slack to update my team: “We don’t have access to any of our funds at the moment. While our money is ‘safe’ it is not accessible to withdraw. We expect to get access to some funds on Monday, which is important because that’s when payroll tries to withdraw money from our account to pay y’all. We hope to not experience any delays and will keep everyone posted!”
SATURDAY, MARCH 11
6 a.m.
My co-founder was on Slack with me the whole weekend. I kind of felt like I was running mission control and I had to communicate with a bunch of different parties. It was sometimes hard to triage. Who did I have to communicate with and who was just trying to be helpful?

I had to keep telling myself: “I cannot access my bank account. I need to do what I have to do to secure funds for Monday.” It was almost as if I was raising venture capital. A fund-raise process, when you’re raising venture capital, can take six to nine months. I was looking to get money in 24 hours. It was intense.
7:41 a.m.
I sent an email to all my investors with the subject line “Winnie urgent cash needs due to SVB.” The email opened: “Hi investors! Thank you for all the advice from our board and others. As I’m sure you are well aware, the F.D.I.C. closed SVB on Friday. We were not prepared for this to happen. I wanted to provide an update on how Winnie is doing right now.”
I told them the situation and I told them how much money we were looking for by Monday. It was under $200,000 to make payroll, but two weeks later we had another payroll looming. That produced a lot of leads. Some people tried to help directly. Other people pointed me to funders and loan options.
I started a spreadsheet and wrote every name down. There was everything out there — people who were going to put money on a convertible note with no prepayment penalties, people looking to charge high interest rates, people who were looking to basically sell your deposits at SVB for a discount. It was kind of hard to know, is this predatory? I was trying to stack rank everything. My investors were my first choice. Then there were my friends who were saying, “Yeah I’ll loan you money on an I.O.U., but I don’t have that much money.” I was cataloging those options.
At one point my husband brought me the leftover cheese quesadillas that my kids hadn’t eaten, which were cold and probably disgusting with their germs and snot, and I scarfed them down like they were the best thing I’d ever tasted. I got notifications from my watch that I wasn’t standing. I was like, “Yeah I’m definitely not standing.”

7:30 p.m.
It was the big annual gala for my kids’ preschool. My husband had been working all school year to plan it. It’s the one event we go to. My mother-in-law came in, she came to say hi to me and I was like, “can’t talk.” I showed up at the gala for an hour. I got there and my investor was calling me, and I was thinking, “This is silly, I can’t even function here.” I was wondering, “Should I have a drink?” I had a sip and thought: “This is a really bad idea.”
8:30 p.m.
I had some food and went home. I was in the process of opening another bank account. The banker who was setting me up with an online portal had to call me. There were also rumors saying that I would have to file an F.D.I.C. claim; investors at that point were sending updates to their portfolio companies on actions you should be taking.
You had to create a login on this government website. They had this whole process to verify your identity where you had to hold up your driver’s license in this very certain way. That took a long time. Then you got into the actual claim filing and all you had to do was write your name and the name of the account. I thought: “This will never work. What is this thing I just filed?”
There were all these rumors in the back channels that you should upload bank statements, but we didn’t have access to our bank statements because they were in the SVB portal that was down. I went to bed late and woke up panicked multiple times throughout the night.
SUNDAY, MARCH 12
10:08 a.m.
I told employees, on Slack, that we were doing everything in our power to make payroll, but there was a chance it might be late. I told them to come to me if that was going to be a real hardship. My employees were so understanding. Some of them came to me proactively and said: “Skip my payroll so you can pay other people.”

11:38 a.m.
We were getting closer to identifying our first and second choice loan options. The people that were loaning us money had to work out what vehicle they were going to do the loans on. We had documents going back and forth with our lawyers. I’m sure I racked up a ton of legal bills.
We reviewed different loan documents and we were finalizing the new bank account setup. I had to update everything that links to our bank account, including platforms like Stripe, which is where our revenue comes into (from child care providers), and I wanted to make sure that wasn’t going to the SVB account.
3:20 p.m.
I was working through a loan document when the news came in that everyone was going to have access to their SVB accounts and be able to withdraw all their money. There was an F.D.I.C. joint statement that everyone started sharing immediately on Twitter: “Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.”
That was the first breather I had. I did go see my kids and get something to eat. Then I realized I needed to thank people for all their help, including investors and everyone who sent me advice along the way.
9 p.m.
I knew I would have to wake up really early on Monday to try and initiate the wire transfer out of SVB. I was trying to figure out how early. Did Monday morning mean midnight? That would be 9 p.m. Pacific on Sunday. I quickly figured out it wasn’t 9 p.m. We also got a new credit card from this company called Ramp, and I was able to move charges to the Ramp card.

MONDAY, MARCH 13
4 a.m.
I set so many alarms, the first being at 4 a.m. Pacific, which was 7 a.m. Eastern, because I didn’t want to be the last one out of SVB. I was able to log in at 6:30 a.m. Pacific. There were 10 different authentication steps to submit a wire transfer where it keeps asking for an additional security question or text message. At each of those steps there was a 90 percent chance of getting logged out because of traffic.
I submitted a wire transfer (for all the money in the account) at 8:30. Then I spent hours just refreshing the new bank’s online portal to see if the money was appearing. Wire transfers are the scariest thing to me. They disappear from one account before you see them in another account. I had never done a wire transfer this big. Normally I would have done a test transfer but I wanted to get it out.
5 p.m.
We had to wait until the money was in our account to initiate the wire transfer to the payroll provider. Then I picked my daughter up from school because I felt like I needed to give my husband a little break. I told my daughter, who is 7½, that all the money was in a new bank account. She did the umpire “safe!” motion. I thought that was really cute. It’s amazing what kids understand.
TUESDAY, MARCH 14
6 a.m.
There were tons of loose ends we had to plug up. We have a couple customers that pay us outside normal systems, through A.C.H. transfers, so we had to update all of our banking information with them.
My other daughter, who is 4, did show and tell at school on Tuesday morning and for her item she picked a piggy bank. She absorbed a lot of this drama, clearly.

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15
8:53 a.m.
There was a bad storm on Tuesday so I lost all power and internet. I took a really cold shower. Then I got in my car and headed to a co-working space. I had to get internet access. I had been ignoring my team. I needed to pay some attention to them and get back to work. There was also a lot to clean up for our new accounts. I needed to figure out the right allocation of funds in all the banking accounts I’ve set up.
There’s some talk of people keeping money with SVB. I received an email from them saying SVB is the safest bank, we will honor your venture debt if you come back. I have to digest that. I don’t ever want to hold all my money in one institution ever again.
THURSDAY, MARCH 16
6:45 a.m.
The power came back after the storm. I cleaned out my refrigerator and took a hot shower. We also have a big product launch coming up next week for summer camps. Now is the time when parents search for summer child care, and we’d hoped to launch the product this week but pushed it to next because of everything going on in the world. Certainly there was some context switching between, “I have no access to my bank,” “I have no access to power” and “OK, we’re back to business.”"

“The 1.5 degree limit is achievable, but it will take a quantum leap in climate action,” a U.N. official said.

1. The Earth will most likely cross a critical warming threshold by 2035, a new U.N. report said.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of climate experts, said in a major new assessment — considered the most comprehensive to date — that nations would need to make an immediate and drastic shift from fossil fuels to prevent the planet from dangerously overheating.
Global average temperatures are estimated to rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels around the first half of the 2030s, according to the report. Beyond that, scientists say, the impacts of climate change will become significantly harder for humanity to handle. However, the report does say that catastrophe can be avoided if emissions are quickly slashed.
In the Midwest, new pipeline battles are brewing over the right to bury carbon emissions underground.
In Washington, President Biden warned that climate change could upend federal spending.
In Somalia, an estimated 43,000 people died last year from the drought.

2023-03-21,"One year after its surprise victory at a Staten Island warehouse, the only union in the country representing Amazon workers has endured a series of setbacks and conflicts that have caused longtime supporters to question if it will survive.
In interviews, a dozen people who have been closely involved with the Amazon Labor Union said the union had made little progress bringing Amazon to the bargaining table, to say nothing of securing a contract. Many cited lopsided losses at two other warehouses, unstable funding and an internal feud that has made it difficult for the union to alter a strategy that they considered flawed.
At the heart of the feud is a dispute between the union’s president, Christian Smalls, and several longtime organizers.
Mr. Smalls’s former allies complain that he has pursued elections at other warehouses without strong support from workers or a plan to ensure victory. They say he has focused on travel and public appearances while neglecting the contract fight at the Staten Island warehouse, known as JFK8, where Amazon is still contesting the election result.

The critics, who include the union’s former treasurer and its former organizing director, favor an alternative approach: amassing enough supporters to credibly threaten a strike and pressure Amazon to negotiate. The process could take months but could increase the chances of winning a contract and collecting dues, without which the union is dependent on donations from other unions and third parties.
“We’re talking to workers, having one-on-ones, growing our power in the building,” said Tristian Martinez, a JFK8 employee who began helping Mr. Smalls organize workers early in the pandemic. “That’s where it matters. Chris flying all over world is not going to make us get to a contract any sooner.”

For his part, Mr. Smalls said that the union was continuing to push for a contract at JFK8, and that a strike threat was counterproductive because it would alarm workers who feared losing their incomes. Amazon had warned workers that unionizing could lead to a strike during which they wouldn’t be paid.
“We’re not going to play into that,” he said in an interview.
He favors filing for elections at other warehouses without waiting to build majority support, he said, because such support can be fleeting amid high turnover among warehouse workers, and because the momentum and media attention created by an election filing can rally workers to the union’s side.

Mr. Smalls called the revolt by his former allies an attempted coup and emphasized that many of the dissidents are white while the union leadership is largely Black, as are many workers. (Ruel Mohan, a mixed-race worker involved with the union who is one of the critics, said of the rift: “I didn’t see anything that had to do with race.”)
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
At a tense union meeting in December, Mr. Smalls told longtime organizers that they should step aside if they couldn’t get along with him or those loyal to him. “You got a problem with me? Deuces,” he said, using a slang term for “goodbye.” The two factions have been operating independently since the meeting.
While strategic debates and personal rivalries are not unusual in the labor movement, the stakes for the Amazon Labor Union are higher than most. Given the e-commerce giant’s growing sway over industries including retail, groceries and health care, many strategists doubt that organized labor can reverse its decline without gaining traction at Amazon.
That would be a tall order for a union under any circumstances. But the Amazon Labor Union’s fracturing has complicated the task. Labor’s hopes of winning at Amazon now hinge on taking on one of the world’s wealthiest companies — amid growing challenges within the union.
It was only days after the Staten Island victory that the union got its first hint of the struggle ahead. Amazon filed more than two dozen formal objections to the election result, which would tie the union up in hearings into the summer. The company soundly defeated the union in an election at a warehouse across the street the next month, and later restricted off-duty employees’ access to break rooms, which organizers had relied on to recruit co-workers. Amazon said it had made the change to ensure employee safety and building security.

As a guerrilla leader who helped raise an insurgent army from a bus stop outside JFK8, Mr. Smalls had been dazzlingly effective. But he could appear shaky as the president of an organization that formally represented thousands of workers.

Though he was compelling in public appearances and proved adept at raising money from outside groups, he showed little interest in matters of governance or budgeting, three former officials said. Organizers struggled to reach him as he bounded between appointments in places like California, Texas, Nevada and Washington, D.C.
Finally, late last summer, the union appeared to find some stability. Jane McAlevey, a prominent organizer and an author who had been advising the group, led two intensive training sessions to help firm up support among JFK8 workers and pressure the company to negotiate.
According to several people who attended, the sessions lasted about six hours each and included role-playing about how to approach workers, techniques for tracking support within the warehouse and strategies for gradually ramping up protest actions, from circulating a petition up to a strike.

Just before Labor Day, a hearing officer for the National Labor Relations Board recommended dismissing Amazon’s election challenge, a big step toward certifying the union’s victory. A few weeks later, the company announced a raise of 25 to 75 cents an hour at the Staten Island warehouse, an increase whose limited size appeared to frustrate workers and increase interest in the union. At a union-sponsored barbecue soon after, many workers signed a petition demanding that Amazon provide an immediate cost-of-living increase.
But the momentum proved short-lived.
In October, workers at an Amazon warehouse in Southern California filed a petition for an election to join the Amazon Labor Union. In backing the petition, Mr. Smalls broke an agreement with Ms. McAlevey — reviewed by The New York Times — in which Mr. Smalls had committed to scale back his travel and refrain from backing elections at most other warehouses until the union was actively negotiating a contract on Staten Island.

“I was in that meeting,” said Heather Goodall, the lead Amazon Labor Union organizer at a warehouse near Albany, N.Y., known as ALB1. Under the agreement, she said, “Christian couldn’t travel, no more filing after ALB1.” But “what does he do?” she continued. “He goes to L.A.”

Ms. McAlevey withdrew from advising the union not long after. In an interview, Mr. Smalls argued that a worker-led movement should not turn down workers in other buildings, and that Ms. McAlevey’s experience was not directly relevant to Amazon. (He appeared in Kentucky on Saturday to throw the union’s support behind an organizing campaign at an Amazon air hub.)

In mid-October, the union lost an election at ALB1 by a roughly two-to-one ratio. Many Amazon Labor Union organizers and officials had worried that the election, which the union filed for in August, was another case in which Mr. Smalls overextended himself.
Ms. Goodall said that workers and organizers in Albany did not receive the support that Mr. Smalls had promised, and that his visits typically happened without much advance notice and were difficult to plan around.
Mr. Smalls said that the union’s job was to enable workers in other buildings “to take a shot” but that it didn’t control what happened there. “The leaders have to step up,” he said. “They have to educate themselves.”
In an Amazon Labor Union board meeting shortly after the election, organizers complained to Mr. Smalls that the Albany campaign had hurt perceptions of the union’s competence, according to four people who were present. They pushed for a process to determine which warehouses the union would support and to add board members to make the union’s leadership more responsive to their concerns.
The loss “made organizing inside JFK8 harder,” said David-Desyrée Sherwood, a JFK8 worker who also served as a union organizer. “I had workers come up to me and ask, ‘What happened in Albany?’”

As the union prepared to meet again in December, Mr. Smalls appeared to be asserting more control, several workers and organizers recalled.
After winning an election, a union must file a constitution and bylaws with the Labor Department that typically lay out parameters like the method of selecting officers and the length of their terms. The Amazon Labor Union created a constitution in the fall of 2021, around the time it filed for an election at JFK8, and modified it after its victory.
Both versions were largely written by some of the current dissidents, including the union’s co-founder and former treasurer, Connor Spence, and they tended to give ordinary workers considerable influence, with low bars for running for office and amending the constitution.

But before the meeting in December, Mr. Smalls oversaw changes to the union’s constitution that restricted worker input in certain ways. Most notably, the document, on file with the U.S. Labor Department, delayed leadership elections that were to take place within a few months until after the union ratified a contract, a process that can take years if it happens at all.

“Going forward, here’s the structure,” Mr. Smalls said at the meeting, according to a recording shared with The Times. “If you can’t abide by this structure, that’s the door.”
Most of the volunteer organizers in the room walked out, according to a half-dozen people in attendance. Mr. Martinez, the longtime organizer, said he had told Mr. Smalls: “Chris, I cannot support this constitution. We are not leaving the A.L.U. by any means, but we do not agree with this.”
The union’s new director of organizing, Evangeline Byars, said it was pointless to have an election before the union had a more systematic way of interacting with workers in the building.
“Is it going to be democratic? No. Connor and them are just going to come into power,” said Ms. Byars, a former official at a local transit workers’ union who is a paid staff member of the A.L.U.
Since the December meeting, the two factions have largely operated on separate tracks. The dissidents have continued to apply Ms. McAlevey’s organizing model, regularly talking to workers in each department, identifying supporters and potential organizers, and preparing for a possible strike if Amazon refuses to bargain.

Mr. Smalls continues to travel widely — he has visited Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and London this year, appearing at labor protests and speaking events — but attends union meetings regularly. Ms. Byars leads shop steward trainings and said 12 workers had completed the program so far. She said the union began a campaign in January to make JFK8 workers aware that they had access to workers’ compensation.
With no contract in sight, the union remains dependent on funding from outside groups whose appetite for donations appears uneven. The Omidyar Network, a liberal philanthropy group, recently contributed $250,000 to a worker support and education fund affiliated with the union.
But a person familiar with the A.L.U. ’s payroll who declined to be identified for fear of retribution said the union had at times been late distributing paychecks in recent months.
Mr. Smalls said paychecks could be delayed if the union missed its deadline for processing payroll. “Sometimes it happens because our treasurer is a worker,” he said, stressing that the union was financially sound.
But he acknowledged that the union’s funding was somewhat erratic. “It comes in waves,” he said. “We have to get donations. That’s what’s been keeping us afloat. That’s the reason I travel so much.”"
2023-03-22,"On top of being a D.J., producer, filmmaker, drummer, Academy Award-winning director, culinary entrepreneur, member of the hip-hop band the Roots and scholar of Black musical history, Ahmir Thompson, also known as Questlove, is a prolific author. He’s written and co-authored seven books, including best sellers like “Mo’ Meta Blues,” “Creative Quest” and “Music is History,” and a forthcoming children’s book about time travel.
Now Thompson is adding a prestigious new title to his wide-ranging list of creative endeavors: publisher.
This year, Thompson is starting his own book imprint within MCD Books, a publishing division at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, where he will acquire an eclectic mix of fiction and nonfiction that ranges from memoir and books by social media stars to works about music history and business.
Thompson described the imprint, which he named AUWA Books, as akin to starting a music label.
“I would like to think of myself of what Def Jam was trying to be back in 1985 — keep my ear to the streets, keep it underground and keep my eyes on people that you otherwise would have never have heard of, but who I feel can really do a paradigm shift,” he said.
He came up with the idea of starting an imprint a few years ago, when he was beginning work on “Summer of Soul,” a documentary he directed about an epic 1969 cultural festival and concert in Harlem. He was unsettled by the fact that the concert marked a pivotal moment in American cultural history, but had largely been forgotten. “With the rapid influx of death happening with Black creators and no one to pass the recipes down I wanted to bring action to a dire situation,” he said.
Publishing books seemed like a way to keep a record and give overlooked cultural figures and movements their due.

2023-03-23,"In the Season 2 finale of “Ted Lasso,” Toheeb Jimoh’s character, Sam Obisanya, stands in front of the vacant storefront he has just bought. “What’s it going to be?” asks the woman who has handed the soccer player his keys. “A Nigerian restaurant,” he says, a broad smile on his face. This moment is a turning point of sorts for Sam, a mark of his ambition and growth from the young man viewers met in the “Ted Lasso” pilot who had recently arrived in Britain.
So it’s fitting that Jimoh, 25, chose Enish, a West African restaurant in Brixton, in South London, a stone’s throw from the actor’s childhood home, for an interview. Dressed in a black sweater and matching cargo pants and tucking into rice and ayamase, a spicy meat stew, Jimoh said that Sam has had a “beautiful arc” over the past two seasons.
“If you had told me at the start of Season 1 that Sam would be a business owner, one of the stars of the team, and dating the boss, I wouldn’t have believed you,” he said. Sam has also gone from a minor character to one of the show’s leads, with his positive attitude and strong work ethic making him a favorite among fans.

The past couple of years have been pretty good to Jimoh, too, who graduated from drama school in 2018. Last year he was nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of Sam, and this month he can be seen onscreen in two major TV shows: the third season of “Ted Lasso,” which started airing on Apple TV+ on March 15, and “The Power,” adapted from the British writer Naomi Alderman’s dystopian novel of the same name, which arrives on Amazon Prime Video on March 31.

“The Power” is a science fiction drama that considers what would happen if women became more physically dominant than men. Jimoh plays Tunde, a young journalist documenting the revolutions that come as women gain new strength, and his character embodies the vulnerability of men in the face of this female power.
Tim Bricknell, an executive producer on “The Power,” said in a recent interview that there were two sides of Jimoh “that made him perfect for this particular role.” The first, he said, is the actor’s “natural charm,” which is integral to Tunde’s character. But the second is Jimoh’s curiosity. “He wants to know what everybody on the crew is doing and is always asking questions,” Bricknell said. “That is quite rare in successful young actors, which makes him perfect for playing a journalist.”
In preparing for the role, Jimoh spoke to his female friends “about routine things that they do to make sure that they’re safe when they go out,” he said. “I was a bit sheepish because I hadn’t realized that.” He sees the book and the TV adaptation as containing “many really interesting questions about the relationships between men and women, society’s relationship with power and how power corrupts people.”
In both “The Power” and “Ted Lasso,” Jimoh plays a Nigerian. The actor — whose parents are Nigerian and who spent some time in the country when he was growing up — is attracted to roles like these that allow him to “speak about my family and culture,” he said. But he also likes to choose roles that explore wider societal topics. His first major acting role came in 2020, when he starred in “Anthony,” a 90-minute BBC drama about  Anthony Walker, a teenager who was killed in a racist attack in England in 2005.

“You can tell from the roles I’ve ended up doing in my career that I was also a kid who would have done politics if I wasn’t an actor,” Jimoh said.

He studied politics in his final years of high school, along with law and history, with acting as his “easy subject on the side,” he said. He didn’t consider it as a career option until a teacher pulled him aside to suggest he could be an actor.
“I thought you had to live in L.A. and have been doing it from 4 years old, or have parents who did it,” Jimoh said. He didn’t know anyone in the acting world, and his parents both worked in hospitals — his father as a caterer and his mother as a health care assistant. “All the grown ups that I knew had very, very normal jobs, and that was the blueprint,” he said.
Soon he was performing in youth productions and had a gig as an usher at the Young Vic theater. One day, sitting across from his friend at school during a lunch break, Jimoh threw his history homework in the trash and decided to pursue acting seriously. “I refused to have a Plan B,” he said, adding that he “harassed my teachers into watching my audition speeches.”
In a school newsletter at the time, one of Jimoh’s teachers wrote that, “In all the years that I have been teaching, never have I come across someone who has such raw talent at such an early age” as Jimoh.

The actor and comedian Brett Goldstein, who plays the former soccer player Roy Kent on “Ted Lasso” and is now a close friend of Jimoh’s, said he believed that the younger actor’s success was partly because of his selective approach to work. “He turns down as much as he takes,” Goldstein, 42, said in a recent interview. “He has integrity and wants to make good stuff.”
Between bites of ayamase, Jimoh said he hoped future opportunities would allow him to show different sides of himself. “I’m just interested in what the story is for that young man, and why it is interesting to tell,” he said of how he chooses his gigs. “There’s a plethora of work out there, and I just want to dip my toe in everything.”
From June, he will be starring in a production of “Romeo and Juliet” at London’s Almeida Theater. He sees the play’s meaning as rooted in “believing young people and their feelings,” noting that he had a friend who died by suicide when he was 15.
“When you’re young, you feel things so deeply,” he said, “and older people might look at that and think it’s a bit naïve, but it leads to stuff like this.”

At the moment, Jimoh said he often finds himself having to perform like Sam when he meets people who recognize him from the show.
“But there is more to me than the squeaky clean ‘Ted Lasso,’” he said, “and I’m excited to show that part of me as well.”"
2023-03-24,"Do your eyes glaze over when you reach the acknowledgments page at the end of a book? If so, you’re missing a delightful window into the village that came together for the barn raising of its publication. Let’s say, for instance, that Amazon Prime’s rendition of “Daisy Jones & the Six” has inspired you to delve into the novel that inspired the show. Flip to Page 353 of the paperback and you’ll find Taylor Jenkins Reid’s homage to her squad, including her agent, book designer, publicists and marketing team.
“To my editor, Jennifer Hershey,” she writes. “From our first conversation I could tell that you would push me to be a better writer, and you have proven me right. I hope you understand the profound gratitude I have for how much more nuanced and honest this book is because of you.”
Let’s pause here (with a silent bow to Reid for thanking her nanny and in-laws for watching her daughter while she worked; this should happen more). Who is Jennifer Hershey and why should you care? She’s the publisher and editor in chief of Ballantine Books, who also happens to be the editor of another mega best seller: “Mad Honey,” by Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan, currently in its 24th week on the hardcover fiction list.
“Our remarkable editor, Jennifer Hershey, is currently being nominated for sainthood,” the authors write in their acknowledgments.
En route to canonization, Hershey earned a significant earthly distinction: the 2023 Editor’s Award from Poets & Writers, which is basically a lifetime achievement award for people who make sure the rest of us have something good to read. Indeed, Hershey has put her mark on many a book that managed to permeate the barrier between distraction and concentration, including ones by George R.R. Martin, Isabel Allende, Curtis Sittenfeld, Diana Gabaldon and Emily Giffin.
So what’s it like to find out that a book you’ve edited has made it to the stratosphere? In a phone interview, Hershey described the arrival of the weekly email containing the latest New York Times best-seller list: “It usually shows up around 5 o’clock on Wednesday and there’s always this nervous, excited anticipation in the hours before it lands. When you’re in the office, it’s kind of fun because even if you don’t have a book hitting the list, you’ll hear someone shrieking down the hallway.”
She went on, “Sometimes we gather as a whole team — the publicity person, the marketing person, the publisher, the editor, all the people who worked on the book — and we call the author together. There’s so much joy in that moment, and definitely a lot of tears. It’s not even so much the hitting the list but what it symbolizes: that an author’s work is reaching people, that their voice is being heard and that readers out in the world are connecting to their words.”

2023-03-25,"The Mexican president wanted cherry trees.
It was 1930, and President Pascual Ortiz Rubio had seen them lining the streets of Washington and desired the same beautiful spectacle for his country’s capital.
To try to fulfill the leader’s request, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs tapped Tatsugoro Matsumoto, a Japanese immigrant who tended the gardens of Chapultepec, then the presidential residence in Mexico City. But winters in the capital were not cold enough for the cherries to fully blossom, the expert gardener said. The president wouldn’t get his hanami, the flower-contemplation ritual the Japanese celebrate every spring.
At least not a pink one.
If cherries were not suitable for the Mexican capital, another tree with colorful flowers might do the trick: jacarandas.
Image
Image
Mr. Matsumoto had already advised another president to plant jacarandas in the city. But those were the post-revolutionary years when there were few government resources to spend on beautifying Mexico’s capital, according to Sergio Hernández, a researcher at the National Institute of Anthropology and History.
History has blurred some details of the president’s request and its execution, but today the jacarandas stand tall among the city’s greenery, a lush canopy heralding spring’s arrival.
For nearly 100 years, Mexico City residents have enjoyed jacaranda season: a “fascinating sorcery” that brings a little bit of the Amazon rainforest to urbanites’ doorstep, as Alberto Ruy Sánchez wrote in his 2019 book “Dicen las Jacarandas.” And when the flowers fall, “the sky blooms on the ground,” an unexpected burst of color at one’s feet.

Each spring, millions of people stroll around the country’s capital under an explosion of purple flowers. Each spring, the colorful fronds signal that it’s time to enjoy the warm season and walk on a fine rug of lavender petals. Come out and play, the jacarandas whisper with an inflection that’s both foreign and familiar.
Image
Image
“I was told this tree always creates hope,” said Alma Basilio, a psychologist posing for a selfie with a friend under the blossoms “The jacaranda is kindness.”
Jacarandas are actually not native to Mexico: The name comes from Guaraní, an Indigenous language spoken mainly in Paraguay and the tree has its origin in the Amazon.

Presidential Election: Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City, won in a landslide victory, becoming the first woman, and the first Jewish person, to be elected president of Mexico.
A Struggle for Water: A system of dams and canals may soon be unable to provide water to Mexico City, a confluence of unchecked growth, crumbling infrastructure and a changing climate.
The Other Busing Program: In response to pressure from the Biden administration to curb migration flows, Mexico has quietly bused thousands of migrants away from the U.S. border to sites deep in the country’s south.
A Train in the Yucatán: El Tren Maya is one of the country’s most-debated infrastructure projects: When it’s a quick trip from the pleasures of Cancún to the remote cities of the Maya, is something lost along the way?
They are deciduous trees, meaning they lose their foliage every year when the weather turns cold enough. And when temperatures rise, their bare, tortuous branches fill with bunches of blooms.

“Boom! Immediately, not progressively, the whole tree is full of flowers,” said José Luis López Robledo, an arborist who runs a nursery garden near Mexico City.
The flowers grow in bunches and bear an attractive purple-blue color because of anthocyanins, a pigment also found in dahlias, berries, black beans and sweet potatoes. In 2021, when most of the planet was focused on pandemic survival, jacaranda was named a trend color by a Mexican forecast company.

“The color jacaranda is an omen for a rebirth,” the agency, Trendo.mx said, describing the hue as between amethyst and mauve, comparable to periwinkle.
The man responsible for the purple spring, Mr. Matsumoto, was one of the first Japanese immigrants to come to Latin America as a free man, at a time when most Asian immigrants in Latin America came either as indentured servants or with contracts to supply cheap labor to plantations, mines and railroads.

Mr. Matsumoto’s Mexican immigration card says he arrived in 1896, and listed “gardener” as his occupation. But in Japan, he was in fact a trained landscape architect who had served the imperial palace, Mr. Hernández explained.
Mr. Matsumoto made his way to the Americas in 1888 at the behest of a Peruvian entrepreneur who wanted a Japanese garden, the first in South America, on his property.
“From his faraway native land, the artist brought by ship beautiful plants,” reads a Peruvian volume about the residence where the garden was built. Shortly after seeing his work in Lima, a Mexican mining businessman hired him to create something for his hacienda.
Image

Mr. Matsumoto would eventually become a wealthy entrepreneur who served several Mexican presidents: from the French-loving Porfirio Díaz to the revolutionary Álvaro Obregón and the nationalist Lázaro Cárdenas. With his flower shop, which he opened in 1898, Mr. Matsumoto introduced ornate floral arrangements to high society and created bouquets for stars of the golden era of Mexican film.
In recent years, Mr. Matsumoto’s talents with flora have made him something of a local pop icon, a quiet hero. But Mr. Hernández, who has documented extensively Mr. Matsumoto’s trajectory, points out he was much more than that.
He didn’t introduce the jacarandas to Mexico — some may have already been growing in the wild — as much as domesticate them. He didn’t just suggest a more appropriate tree for the weather in the Mexican capital: He outfitted its streets with an aesthetic vision that resurfaces every spring.
“Matsumoto was a merchant of landscapes,” said Mr. Hernández.
In a city of old trees and crooked sidewalks, jacarandas are good tenants: Their roots tend to grow downward — instead of to the sides — and leave the urban infrastructure almost untouched. But because they grow tall (they can reach up to 80 feet), they can be a nemesis of electric wires and a target of the tree trimmers of the utility company.
In recent years, jacarandas have also drawn detractors: “Controversy Blooms Over Jacarandas,” read an article this month that quoted specialists warning exotic species might create imbalance in the local ecosystems.

“They’re too hyped,” said Francisco Arjona, 34, an environmental engineer who leads tours of trees around Mexico City. He can list parks, intersections and parking spaces where one can admire the spectacle, but he also reminds visitors that they are also home to many other beautiful native trees.
Image
Image
By the 1940s, as the first generation of jacarandas were perhaps a bit over 30 feet high, Mr. Matsumoto and his son, Sanshiro, had become advocates for their community. When Mexico ordered all Japanese in the country to relocate to Mexico City and Guadalajara because of World War II, the Matsumotos interceded with the government and lodged 900 of their displaced compatriots in one of their many sprawling haciendas.
Jesús Roldán, 38, a mountain climber, was sitting below the crooked branches of a blooming jacaranda outside the Palace of Fine Arts, one of the most tagged trees on Instagram.

“They seem really complex to me, from their stature to their color, its arms and structure are very difficult to understand,” he said. “I think they’re not comfortable, perhaps they’d be better elsewhere.”
Matsumoto Flowershop, on the northern edge of a trendy street in the Roma Norte neighborhood sits now mostly vacant, its expansive front outfitted with a handful of withering plastic flowers, an old sign and a lonely desk. Mexico City’s urban landscape is continually changing: new buildings rise every day, hundreds of  palm trees are dying to an unforgiving plague, water-conscious gardeners look for plants that will last through a drought. Winters are becoming shorter and hotter.
However, “if something will survive, it’ll be the jacarandas,” said Mr. López Robledo.

Times graphics reporters Anjali Singhvi and Bedel Saget recently traveled to Antakya, a Turkish city badly damaged by February’s earthquakes. Based on their reporting, they published an article this week that walks through the damage in Antakya’s Old City, a commercial and religious hub.
The initial quakes were several weeks ago, but the damage continues to dominate life in much of Turkey and Syria. I spoke with Anjali and Bedel about what they saw in Antakya.
Ashley: What surprised you about Antakya’s destruction?
Bedel: I had in my mind what the destruction would look like, but when you’re driving around and seeing residential building after residential building flattened, it stops you in your tracks. We saw a building split in half — half had collapsed and half was still standing — and we could see an entire dining room set still present on the third floor, as though it were a dollhouse.
Anjali: We also saw so many photographs of missing people placed right outside the damaged buildings. I had assumed they were part of residents’ belongings in that building, but a local journalist told me that families left photos of their loved ones around the site of the rubble so that if someone clears debris or continues the search, those photos might help identify bodies.

2023-03-27,"Gail Collins: Bret, I have to admit that when the subject of Donald Trump comes up these days, I tend to start telling sex-scandal stories. My bad.
Bret Stephens: Don’t let me stand in your way.
Gail: Right now, that very old Stormy Daniels mess seems to have produced some very scary stuff. Our former president is warning of “death & destruction” if the investigation into his cover-up attempts goes any further. Yipes.
Bret: You’re referring to Trump’s late-night social media post in which he warns of violence if he’s indicted by the Manhattan D.A., Alvin Bragg, whom he also called a “degenerate psychopath who truely hates the USA!” Truely.
Gail: Wow, you’d think by now he’d be a fan of spell check. And of course, we heard a lot about his innocence and Bragg’s “prosecutorial misconduct” during that long-winded speech he made in Waco on Saturday night.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Don’t know how much our former president knows about prosecutorial procedure, but he’s definitely got expertise when it comes to misconduct.
Bret: The way I read it, Trump is goading Bragg to indict. It would be an exceptionally weak case, resting on what is ordinarily a misdemeanor offense, one that the Justice Department and the previous D.A., Cy Vance, refused to prosecute. But an indictment would force every Republican, including Trump’s primary rivals, to line up behind him, shine a media spotlight on him that can only benefit his candidacy and bring a lot of focus to bear on a left-wing D.A. whose priorities should be devoted to making his city safer from rising crime.
Gail: Taking one quick moment to point out that New York City has actually been doing pretty well in combating crime — in Manhattan, Trump’s longtime playground, the major crime rate is well below what it was in the 1990s.
Go on ….
Bret: I think the more recent evidence is mixed. Shootings and murders are down from last year, but carjackings and robberies are up.
Gail: Let me interrupt again to point out that the states with the biggest soaring-crime problems are mainly Southern and quite red. Continue ….

Bret: True. Also true is that in 2021, not one of the 10 large cities in America with the highest homicide rates had a Republican mayor.
Back to the potential indictment. If I didn’t know better, I’d be tempted to think Bragg was secretly working for Trump’s re-election, though he just strikes me as being out of his depth.
Gail: Can’t argue Bragg has proved himself a prosecutorial genius so far. If you look at the bad stuff Trump has done in Manhattan, it’s amazing he hasn’t been indicted earlier.
But Bret, I feel obliged to move on to some non-Trumpian subject. Congress! Think they’ll ever manage to come up with a budget before the big deadline?
Bret: Gail, what I think this country really needs is to default on the federal debt right around the time we have a banking crisis.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Gail: Eek!
Bret: Kidding! I think there’s a deal out there that looks something like this: House Republicans agree to raise the debt ceiling. The Biden administration returns unspent Covid funds. Both sides agree to higher Pentagon spending, especially to replenish inventories depleted by the war in Ukraine. The Supreme Court strikes down President Biden’s student-loan forgiveness plan at the end of June. And if all else fails, the government gets funded through a continuing resolution.
Gail: Don’t buy the Supreme Court part.
Bret: But the thing that mainly has me scared, Gail, is the state of the economy. A banking crisis is sure to hurt nearly every corner of the economy.
Gail: That’s why I like Biden’s approach about spending government money to buoy the economy, then penalize as many of the banking villains as possible.
Bret: For the banking villains, I think we’d probably have to start with the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, who kept interest rates too low for too long and thereby encouraged a lot of magical thinking that rates would stay low forever.
Gail: Hey, no fair! You always start with the Fed …
Bret: I’d also have to put Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, in the dock for telling us she didn’t expect inflation to persist and for bailing out all the wealthy Silicon Valley Bank depositors who should have lost their shirts. And then there were all the Covid big spenders, in both the Trump administration and this one, who poured so much money into the system that it helped spark inflation — aided and abetted, of course, by supply-chain bottlenecks and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Anyone I miss?
Gail: Well, you missed that part about the anti-vaxxers who helped keep Covid spreading — wouldn’t have had to do nearly as much spending if there hadn’t been so much Covid.
And while I’m not going to the mat with you on Yellen right now, I truly don’t think we’d be in better shape if she had just let all the Silicon Valley depositors tank at that precise moment in time. Totally happy with going after them over the long haul.
Bret: The management of the bank didn’t exactly cover itself with glory. Same deal with First Republic, where relatives of the chairman were taking multimillion-dollar fees as consultants. If I were the chief executive of any bank today, large or small, I’d immediately announce that I wouldn’t take a bonus, would never hire a relative and would cut whatever my salary is in half, at least until the bank proved capable of surviving this storm.
Gail: Bret for banker in chief! But before the phones start pinging, let’s go back to Congress for a minute. Do you agree the Republicans are just afraid to negotiate a budget deal? Because their base would kill them if they came around to anything … sane?
Bret: At this point, Gail, I think the caller is inside the house. Or House. Kevin McCarthy and the rest of the Republican leadership have as much to fear from Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz and their ilk as they do from the so-called base — most of whom probably aren’t looking too closely at the terms of any potential deal.

Speaking of Congress, did you follow the TikTok hearings?
Gail: Well, it was hard to miss all that yelling. Bret, I think the whole internet communications revolution is hugely important and frequently worrisome. But I can’t say I ever blamed the Chinese. You?
Bret: I definitely blame the Chinese government.
It’s bad enough that Amazon, Meta and pretty much every other digital company extract reams of data from their customers with only the minimum of consent; at least those companies are regulated by a free government and exposed to a free press. TikTok can extract the same data at the behest of a repressive Chinese government that keeps proving itself utterly untrustworthy when it comes to intellectual property, so why should it behave any better with personal data?
Gail: OK, you’ve won me over. I promise to fret about China.
Bret: I’m with the Biden administration on this: Either TikTok’s parent company sells it to an American owner or we shut it down. Maybe it will even get our 12-year-olds to read a book or two instead of trying to go viral with stupid videos.
Gail: Somehow, I don’t think an American-owned TikTok would be trying to turn the nation’s 12-year-olds into denizens of the library.
Bret: Fact check: True.
Gail: Now, onward — Medicare! I’m sure you saw our colleagues’ coverage of the Biden administration’s plan to lower payments to private health insurers through Medicare Advantage. The health care industry is going nuts.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
I’ve always been a fan of more activist oversight on this front. Any thoughts?
Bret: I’m no expert, and I’m always in favor of curbing waste and fraud in the system, of which there is always too much whenever the federal government is involved. But maybe one of our knowledgeable readers would like to explain how what the Biden administration is proposing doesn’t end up in higher premiums and fewer benefits. No medical system will ever square the circle of accessibility, affordability, solvency and quality. Just ask the Brits, whose beloved National Health Service is falling apart.
I’m sometimes tempted by the logic that people should voluntarily not seek extraordinary medical care after a certain age, like 80. Tempted — but not persuaded.
Gail: You’ll be hearing from the increasingly large number of friends I have who are over 90 …
Bret: Not to mention my mother.
Gail, before we go, our readers really mustn’t miss John Leland’s wondrous story from the Metropolitan section about the house at 64 East Seventh Street, which is the subject of a song cycle by several artists in collaboration with the writer David Hajdu. Over the years, the building housed everything from a pro-Communist newspaper to a literary hangout for the likes of Allen Ginsberg to a macrobiotic restaurant where Yoko Ono waited tables and apparently made a mean salad to a bookshop that attracted the likes of Lou Reed and Marianne Moore.

2023-03-29,"Some books lend themselves to stage adaptation more than others, and the experimental theater company Complicité has a strong track record of turning awkward novels into plays. The British troupe, led by the director Simon McBurney, has already created acclaimed productions from Mikhail Bulgakov’s “The Master and Margarita” and Max Porter’s “Grief Is the Thing With Feathers.”
Complicité’s latest show is a suitably idiosyncratic treatment of “Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead,” the surreal eco-thriller by the Polish author and Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk. It runs at the Barbican Theater in London through April 1, then tours Britain before playing at some major European venues and festivals, including the Ruhrtriennale in Germany, and the Odéon — Théâtre de l’Europe in Paris.
Tokarczuk’s novel revolves around a series of grisly murders in a remote village in southern Poland. The narrator-protagonist, Janina, a semiretired teacher and passionate animal lover in her 60s, takes a keen interest in the case, pestering the local police force with her unsolicited insights and pushing a bizarre theory that, since all the victims were avid hunters or poachers, the murders must have been carried out by animals as an act of revenge. Along the way she holds forth on animal cruelty, astrology and her love of the English poet William Blake.
Complicité’s decision to foreground these freewheeling digressions is to be commended: This is not a conventional whodunit but, rather, a kind of fable. The production’s blend of philosophical purpose and irreverent humor rings true to the book’s spirit, and makes for an entertaining and thought-provoking spectacle.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The spine of the play is a spotlit monologue by Janina, who dips in and out of the action as it unfolds around her. Amanda Hadingue — standing in for Kathryn Hunter, who has been unwell — brings a disarmingly self-effacing grace to the lead role, ensuring Janina retains the audience’s sympathy, even as she rails abrasively against the industrial slaughter of animals, the hypocrisy of organized religion and the unquestioning passivity of her fellow townspeople.
Indeed, the entire production is delivered with a playful esprit that borders on the pantomimic: Self-important cops are played for laughs, as is the supercilious local priest; there are charming cameos from animals played by humans — a dog here, a fox there; and César Sarachu almost steals the show in a wonderfully droll performance as Janina’s endearingly hapless neighbor, Oddball.
Interiority is the perennial challenge when adapting literary novels for stage or screen. A slick 2017 movie adaptation of “Drive Your Plow” called “Spoor,” by the Polish director Agnieszka Holland, rendered it as a straight-up nor thriller. It was well wrought but inevitably one-dimensional: Janina’s distinctive narrative voice, which treads a fine line between eccentric and downright cranky, is integral to the novel’s charm; the story feels flat without it. Complicité’s adaptation neatly sidesteps this problem by juxtaposing the inner and outer worlds in a way that feels lively and dynamic.

McBurney, the director, is known for his exuberant use of audiovisual effects, and his team have conjured an impressive sensory texture here. A big screen at the rear of the stage displays eye-catching images that complement the action. Some are scene-setting, such as snowy landscapes evoking the bitterly cold Polish winter; others, such as a series of detailed drawings of horoscope charts, are thematic.

Richard Skelton’s atmospheric score alternates between brooding suspense and doleful solemnity, though the sound designer Christopher Shutt is maybe a little too trigger-happy with the sudden loud noises: I feared for some of the older theatregoers, but it certainly kept the audience alert.
Rae Smith’s costume design is understatedly on point: Janina pads around in a jarringly mismatched sports-casual ensemble that is precisely the kind of thing an unabashed eccentric might wear, and the local huntsmen look appropriately forbidding in their uniformly dark puffer jackets.
Clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, “Drive Your Plow” is a bit too long.  A subplot about Janina’s unspecified chronic illness (“my ailments”) could perhaps have been significantly abridged, or even cut, to give the play a zippier feel. But its shortcomings are essentially those of the novel: its single-track didacticism; its neat pitting of romantic idealists against macho, insentient normies; and the fact that a decisive plot twist can be spotted a mile off.
Complicité is no stranger to politics: “The Encounter,” adapted in 2016 from a novel by the Romanian-American author Petru Popescu, addressed environmental destruction in the Amazon; the company’s 2015 children’s play “Lionboy” touched on the ethically dubious machinations of Big Pharma. Crucially, the company’s dissident ethos extends to form as well as subject matter. “Drive Your Plow’s” parable of hubris offers considerable food for thought as we continue to hurtle toward climate disaster: Janina is a Cassandra figure for the 21st century, a voice of reason doomed to be met with indifference, condescension or ridicule. The political message is deadly earnest. Thankfully, Complicité serves it up with a dose of fun.

This means it’s hard to invest in the U.S. stock market, such as through a 401(k) or pension plan, and not be highly dependent on the fate of the two tech giants. More than $15 trillion in assets, from pension funds and endowments to insurance companies, are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index in some way, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with more than 10 cents of every dollar allocated to the broad index flowing through to Microsoft’s and Apple’s market valuation.
It is a phenomenon explained by how the benchmark is constructed, and it is amplified by the way tech has come to dwarf other industries, in the markets and the economy. And it means that the two companies together can sway the direction of the broad market, sometimes masking turmoil that has taken place underneath.

Apple and Microsoft accounted for about half of that gain, according to data from S&P. Both were seemingly immune to the banking crisis and boosted by fervor over artificial intelligence, with Apple rising 11.4 percent during the month and Microsoft 15.6 percent.
It can be jarring for investors to see the index perform so differently from what they may have predicted, said Fiona Cincotta, a stock market analyst at StoneX, a brokerage.
“It’s phenomenal that two companies can direct so much power within the S&P 500,” she said. “These two companies seem to have been single-handedly directing the index.”
It was true even at the height of the frenzy. On Monday, March 13, immediately after the government seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, signs of panic were everywhere: Several regional banks suffered their worst day ever in the stock market, with First Republic Bank down more than 60 percent, in conditions so chaotic that trading in many individual stocks was halted as stock exchanges tried to limit the damage.

Outside the stock market, government bond yields went haywire, oil prices slid and the dollar weakened, all showing that alarms about the economy were ringing on trading desks around the world.
Yet the S&P 500 spent much of the day in positive territory, and it ended with a barely noticeable decline of 0.1 percent. Credit, again, goes to Microsoft and Apple, which both rose enough to counter a 15 percent slide in the entire regional banking sector that day.
Much of this comes down to how the S&P 500 is designed. Its value is calculated by a measure that considers the overall market capitalization of a company. It means the stock moves of the largest companies carry the greatest weight, because even slight changes in their value create or destroy billions of dollars of shareholder value.
As one of 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500, the tech industry accounts for more than a quarter of the stock index’s value.

Apple, at roughly $2.4 trillion, and Microsoft, at $2.1 trillion, are so large that, taken together, the two companies would be the third-largest sector of the index, behind tech and health care. They would be larger than the energy sector and roughly the size of the financials sector.

This influence is a result of a decades-long shift in both the markets and the economy since the dot-com boom, a change that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Low interest rates put in place to support the economy after the Great Recession made borrowing cheap and pushed investors to seek out higher returns from riskier companies, spurring financing and growth for tech companies. Apple and Microsoft excelled.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Apple in 2018 became the first American company valued at more than $1 trillion on the stock market. As its value inflated, so did that of its rivals Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) — a group that came to be called the FANG stocks. They helped to lift the index to new highs over a more than decade-long bull market. Since then, Apple and Microsoft have become proportionally much larger, more than twice the size of the next largest company.
This dynamic is not wholly unusual in the history of the S&P 500, though it is extreme, and it has been exacerbated by the rapid growth of some tech companies through the pandemic. (At the end of 2018, Microsoft’s and Apple’s combined index weight was less than Apple’s is today on its own.) The previous company to reach Microsoft’s 6.2 percent weight in the index was IBM in the mid-80s, based on data for the end of each calendar year.
“I don’t think it’s a problem,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “This is what the whole thing is worth, and if Apple or Microsoft go up or down, there is proportional impact because they are worth more. It’s market-driven.”
The S&P also produces an “equal weight” index, where each stock has the same effect on the wider group. In March, that index fell 2.6 percent.

Another commonly cited measure of Wall Street’s performance, the Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index that has been criticized for how it emphasizes companies based on their share price alone.
And then there are the underlying sectors, which are also tracked in separate indexes by S&P. These indexes, which tend to more directly show pain afflicting their subsets of stocks, show that the financial sector fell almost 10 percent in March, while energy stocks dropped 0.5 percent and real estate companies slid 2.1 percent. They also show that other parts of the market — like utilities — fared just fine.
“There were so many sectors that underperformed and were in the red across the month, and that was completely pushed over and overshadowed by the gains in big tech,” Ms. Cincotta said.
S&P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the S&P 500 as well as the Dow, has tried to address the impact of these specific weightings, at least on different sectors. In 2018, it moved Alphabet and Meta out of the tech sector and into the communications category with Netflix, while leaving Amazon in the consumer discretionary category with other retailers.
Since then, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have slowly lost value, while Apple and Microsoft have grown. The technology sector in the S&P 500 has also been bolstered by the emergence of new behemoths like the chip maker Nvidia, which is valued around three quarters of a trillion dollars.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
This month, S&P sought to rebalance the index again, moving a handful of large tech-oriented companies — like Visa and PayPal — into the financials sector, but further entrenching Apple and Microsoft’s dominance as the two tech heavyweights.
Of course, this cuts both ways. In 2022, the S&P 500 slumped close to 20 percent, a drop that would have been much smaller without the lousy performance of the tech sector. Apple and Microsoft together accounted for roughly one-fifth of the index’s total decline last year.
But for now, analysts see reasons for tech to continue to rally.
One reason is the excitement over artificial intelligence. Microsoft has a large stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and many investors foresee the nascent technology driving the next phase of growth for the companies developing the software as well as the chip makers whose processors power it.
Tech stocks are also benefiting from the concern over the country’s banks, which has led investors to quickly cut back their expectation for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The sector is particularly sensitive to interest rates, and absent an imminent recession, lower rates in the future would be a boost for the sector.
And, analysts said, large technology companies have become havens where investors can wait out the current storm.
“It’s been a big bull cycle for tech,” said George Catrambone, the head of Americas trading at DWS, a fund manager. “I don’t think people will give up that paradigm easily.”"

What’s Up? (March 26-April 1)
Silicon Valley Bank Changes Hands
First Citizens BancShares, a family-run bank in North Carolina, announced last Sunday that it was acquiring Silicon Valley Bank, capping off a tumultuous month for the California lender whose collapse touched off a wider banking crisis. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized control of SVB and its assets on March 10, after a run on deposits left it insolvent, and SVB filed for bankruptcy a week later. First Citizens’ deal with the F.D.I.C. to take over the bank involved the purchase of about $72 billion in loans at a $16.5 billion discount. First Citizens also took control of all of the bank’s roughly $56 billion in deposits. But an additional $90 billion in SVB’s securities remain under the purview of the F.D.I.C. The collapse of SVB was followed in short succession by two other bank failures. Credit Suisse, which was bought by its rival UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, and Signature Bank. New York Community Bancorp later acquired substantially all of the remaining deposits at Signature Bank.
And in Other SVB News
At a Senate Banking Committee hearing last week on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, federal regulators blamed the banks’ executives for poor management and risk assessment, which, they argued, led to the collapses. They also suggested bank managers could face penalties if they did anything improper. But the regulators themselves were not off the hook: They were the ones in the hot seat on Tuesday, answering questions from lawmakers about why certain red flags went unheeded and how to avoid future bank failures. The Federal Reserve, in particular, is under scrutiny for not doing enough to prevent the banks’ implosions. Michael S. Barr, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, said he learned about SVB’s problems only in February. These lines of questioning are expected to continue this week, when the House Financial Services Committee holds its own hearing on Wednesday.
Not the Usual Treatment
Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, did not get the treatment he was used to receiving in Washington on Wednesday when he appeared before a committee, led by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, scrutinizing him for what lawmakers termed “illegal union busting.” In the past, Democrats praised Mr. Schultz for his business practices, but last week liberal members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions pressed the longtime chief executive with questions about whether he had participated in decisions to fire or discipline workers involved in the union drive at Starbucks. Lawmakers said they had heard of “widespread anti-union efforts” at the company, but Mr. Schultz called those accusations “propaganda” and instead highlighted Starbucks’s pay and benefits for workers.

What’s Next? (April 2-8)
Taking the Labor Market’s Temperature
Recent job reports took many analysts by surprise, blowing past expectations and breaking a trend line that had suggested the jobs market was gradually cooling off. Forecasters were going into Friday’s jobs report with similar expectations — the consensus was that employers added 240,000 jobs in March. But it’s unclear how closely the new data will conform to those predictions. Even amid high-profile layoff announcements at companies like Amazon and NPR, jobless claims remain low. And though the banking crisis has fomented concerns about the economic outlook — and darkened the forecast for later this year — its hasn’t yet had an effect on jobs figures.

The I.R.S.’s Cash Infusion
The Internal Revenue Service is expected to release its plan this week for how to manage the $80 billion the Biden administration has allocated to overhaul the agency, which has struggled in recent years with an enormous tax return backlog, staffing shortages, outdated technology and a lack of funding. But shoring up the I.R.S. has become a partisan issue, with Republicans fervently opposed to aiding the agency, which they argue would give it too much power over taxpayers. Of new concern to conservatives in Congress, as well as lobbyists for the tax preparation industry, is a potential plan for the I.R.S. to create its own tax-filing system that would allow taxpayers to submit their returns directly to the federal government at no cost.
Trump’s Arraignment
Former President Donald J. Trump is likely to be arraigned on Tuesday after a grand jury in Manhattan voted last week to indict him for his role in paying hush money to an adult film star during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. In the immediate aftermath of the indictment, users on social media channels associated with right-wing extremists and conspiracy theorists searched for an explanation for why Mr. Trump met this fate. But the responses did not coalesce around any one narrative or call to action: Although some urged their fellow Trump supporters to rise to the former president’s defense, others suggested it would be best to wait until more was known about the indictment and argued an indictment would help him win re-election in 2024.
What Else?
The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge cooled to 5 percent on an annual basis in February. New rules released on Friday by the Treasury Department significantly limit the electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. Detroit automakers report their March sales figures this week, which will show how the Fed’s interest rate increases have affected demand for vehicles."

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Congratulations to Andrea Carla Michaels and Christina Iverson, who share the byline on today’s New York Times Crossword. This is Ms. Michaels’s 81st puzzle and 50th collaboration in The Times, and Ms. Iverson’s 18th puzzle and 14th collaboration. That’s a lot of collaborative crossword making between these two powerhouse constructors!
Their puzzle today invokes a theme that was also present in their last collaboration — did you notice? We’ll unpack that theme in a moment, but first, let’s take a peek at the handful of tougher clues in today’s fairly gentle Tuesday puzzle.
Tricky Clues
1A./26D. I’m a sucker for a repeated clue, so I loved seeing the wordplay clue “Animal house?” used for both ZOO and LAIR. I especially liked that the clue appears to allude to a movie, which is thematically appropriate.
14A. I enjoyed the clue “Feathered Australian” for EMU because it’s funny to imply that animals have nationalities. Here at Wordplay, our comment moderators are called EMUs, which Wordplay lore suggests may be short for “electronic moderation units.”
43A. For those who are not up on their Latin or their court pleas, the word NOLO fills in the blank in the clue “___ contendere (court plea).” If you plead NOLO contendere, you agree to accept punishment without admitting guilt.
1D. I fully agree with the clue “Greek letter that sounds like it should be last, but isn’t” for ZETA. It starts with a Z, so naturally (according to the pattern-seeking part of my brain), it must be last — even though it isn’t.
41D. The clue “Small opening in the skin” for PORE brought to mind the horrifying headline of this New York Times article that has seared itself into my psyche.

Today’s Theme
This puzzle features the names of four movies, three of which have something in common and a fourth that serves as a revealer. As I was solving, I had no clue what united the movies I was entering into the grid, right up until I reached the revealer. That air of mystery made the “aha!” moment that much more satisfying.
I was able to throw in the first movie entry without any crosses. Although it was before my time, I love the “1988 rom-com set in a New England restaurant,” which could only be MYSTIC PIZZA. I once ate pizza at Mystic Pizza, and it was pretty great!

Next up is BROADCAST NEWS (“1987 film set in a Washington, D.C., TV station”). I admit I had never heard of this movie, but the crosses were helpful, as was the clue’s reference to a TV station.
The third theme film is ROSEMARY’S BABY (“1968 horror film set in a New York City apartment”), which I have also never seen (I’m a wimp when it comes to horror movies.) But I had definitely heard of it.
So what do these three films have in common? The answer is revealed in the title of the final film in the grid: DELIVERANCE (“1972 thriller set in the backwoods of Georgia … or a plot point in 18-, 29- and 49-Across?”). All three of the other films feature things that can be delivered: pizza, the news and a baby. The last of these, as I hinted at above, was central to the theme of the constructors’ October 2021 puzzle, which had the revealer “HERE COMES MY BABY.”
Let’s hear from Ms. Michaels and Ms. Iverson about how this puzzle came together.
Constructor Notes
Andrea Carla Michaels: After Christina and I did a puzzle about going into labor and delivering a baby, I got to thinking about what else is delivered. Babies, the news, pizza, milk (in the Olden Days), mail/Amazon packages (in the Newen Days). We thought it’d be fun to think of films with those words in the titles, with the reveal being “Deliverance,” a pivotal film of my adolescence.
“Licorice Pizza” was out in the theaters, but we weren’t sure it would stand the test of time. The tricky part was finding a way to unite the films clue-wise, so we focused on the setting where the actors “deliver” their performances. I think it’s pretty tough without at least one major actor’s name attached (Julia Roberts, Holly Hunter, Burt Reynolds), but space limitations prevailed. As a serious movie buff, I love this puzzle. And I loved working on a “sequel” with Christina!
Christina Iverson: Andrea is a pleasure to work with, and I’m happy to share a byline with her again! When this puzzle comes out, we will have just seen each other in person at A.C.P.T. (the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament). Maybe one day we’ll make a puzzle together that has nothing to do with delivering babies!

2023-04-04,"Amid recent debates over several publishers’ removal of potentially offensive material from the work of popular 20th-century authors — including Roald Dahl, R.L. Stine and Agatha Christie — is a less discussed but no less thorny question about the method of the revisions. For some e-book owners, the changes appeared as if made by a book thief in the night: quietly and with no clear evidence of a disturbance.
In Britain, Clarissa Aykroyd, a Kindle reader of Dahl’s “Matilda,” watched a reference to Joseph Conrad disappear. (U.S. editions of Dahl’s books were unaffected.) Owners of Stine’s “Goosebumps” books lost mentions of schoolgirls’ “crushes” on a headmaster and a description of an overweight character with “at least six chins.” Racial and ethnic slurs were snipped out of Christie’s mysteries.
In each case, e-books that had been published and sold in one form were retroactively (and irrevocably) altered, highlighting what consumer rights experts say is a convention of digital publishing that customers may never notice or realize they signed up for. Buying an e-book doesn’t necessarily mean it’s yours.
“Nobody reads the terms of service, but these companies reserve the right to go in there and change things around,” said Jason Schultz, the director of New York University’s Technology Law and Policy Clinic and a co-author of “The End of Ownership.”

“They make it feel similar to buying a physical book, but in reality it’s 180 degrees different,” he added.
Automatic e-book updates are a common feature of many popular e-book platforms, including Amazon’s Kindle and Google Play. A typical update might change a book’s cover art to match a new film or television adaptation, or add material in response to new developments in a story. But publishers can issue updates for any reason and generally don’t identify or explain revisions. The edits to Stine’s and Christie’s novels came to wide attention only when they were reported this month by The Times of London and The Telegraph, years after having been pushed out to readers.
Derek Wheeler, a Kindle user in Washington who noticed last year that his e-book of Stine’s “Welcome to Dead House” had been changed from the print edition, said he hadn’t realized the full implications of the updates, which Amazon turns on by default. It’s unclear when Scholastic, Stine’s publisher, made the revisions, which advanced the story’s timeline by several years, among other changes.
“It’s nice if they can fix grammatical errors, but changing details that can fundamentally alter the story bothers me,” he said.
Users can turn off automatic updates in their Amazon preferences. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the company said that “Publishers control the copyright for the books they publish and so control the content and updating of their Kindle books.”

Google Play automatically updates e-books with no option to opt out. A representative for Google declined to comment.
Representatives for Stine and Scholastic didn’t respond to requests for comment, but the author has said publicly that he was unaware of recent changes to his books.
Terry Adams, a vice president who runs paperback and digital publishing at Little, Brown and Company, whose authors include James Patterson, Evelyn Waugh and Donna Tartt, said the company regularly makes “corrections” to e-books at editors’ and authors’ discretion, fixing factual errors and typos, rewording phrases and adding new passages, among other changes. These edits are typically not recorded publicly, Adams said, in line with industry standards.
Representatives for other major book publishers either declined to comment about their e-book policies or didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Penguin Random House, HarperCollins and Simon and Schuster declined to comment. Macmillan didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.
Readers of fine print have long noted the legal loophole that grants publishers vast control over content in most popular digital libraries: Customers don’t technically own the content they purchase on these platforms but license it from the copyright holder. Licensing, which allows rights owners to set the terms of the use of their intellectual property, is the standard not only in sales of e-books but of movies, television shows, video games and other forms of artistic content.
Sales of many kinds of physical media, including print and disc formats, are also governed by licenses. But digital platforms allow publishers to more easily and precisely manage content than before.

“In the past there were restrictions to what you could do with media — you could only make a certain number of copies, for example — but there was no really effective way of policing that,” said Colin Gavaghan, professor of digital futures at the University of Bristol Law School. “Now the owner can just directly control what you do with these things.”
Subscription-based streaming services like Netflix and Spotify imply conditional access to libraries whose content can change. (Last year, the singers Beyoncé and Lizzo both edited songs after release to remove a word some listeners found offensive.) But the language used by many popular digital media stores can be misleading about ownership, experts said. Visitors to Amazon’s Kindle store purchase books by clicking the company’s familiar “buy now” button; text throughout the store — including in the description of automatic book updates — even declares that users “own” their books. But Kindle’s terms of use make clear that content on the platform is in fact “licensed, not sold, to you by the content provider.”
Media purchased through Apple’s portals — which use similar ownership language — including books, movies, TV shows, music and video games, “may be removed” or “become unavailable for further download or access” at any time and for unspecified reasons, according to the company’s terms and conditions. And Google Play’s terms of service refer to “certain cases” in which the company “may remove from your device or cease providing you with access to certain content that you have purchased.”
Representatives for Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
“There are streaming services out there where nobody rationally thinks that they own the movies or music they stream, but a lot of this other stuff is sold to people as if they own it,” Schultz said. “If these companies are going to reserve all these rights to remove or change things at any moment, that should be something they tell you right up front in big letters, not the fine print.”
Though most common in e-book publishing, post-purchase edits could be deployed for other kinds of digital media that are stored on a platform that works with content owners, experts said. In recent years, some customers have reported lost access to video content: movies or television shows that vanish after a change in copyright ownership, or that are pulled from stores for outré material, as happened in 2020 with several episodes of “30 Rock” featuring blackface. (In 2021, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit claiming that Amazon’s video store was designed to “deceive, mislead and defraud consumers,” for technical reasons.) But there appear to be few examples of retroactive editing to films or television shows to date.
Gavaghan, the digital futures professor, said he expects the fate of such a case will someday be decided in court.
“I’ve been watching for that for a while,” he said. “Once the capacity is there, it’s only a matter of time.”"
2023-04-05,"When vials of Mielle Organics’ rosemary-mint hair oil started disappearing from store shelves this year, Black women who had come to rely on the product were appalled.
Social media sleuths quickly found that in December, the influencer Alix Earle had shared with her nearly five million followers on TikTok that she had experienced “tremendous hair growth” while using the oil. Joining a wave of other influencers who had also started to endorse the product, Ms. Earle, who is white, added it to her Amazon storefront, where she earns a commission when her followers buy the items that she recommends.
In post after post on social media, Black women lamented that all this attention did not bode well for their favorite product. In their view, an oil that they felt had been created specifically for their hair, when relatively few products are, had been hijacked by non-Black consumers. (Ms. Earle did not respond to requests for an interview.)
“At one point, it was sold out at every single Target in New Hampshire,” said Ronelle Tshiela, 23, a law student at the University of New Hampshire, who had used the oil for several years. “I was frustrated because as a Black woman, there’s not that many options to begin with. The natural and ethnic hair care aisle is very limited.”

Even in a multibillion-dollar industry, there are many hair-care manufacturers with few offerings specifically formulated for Black hair, if any at all. In that vacuum, Black-owned hair care companies like Mielle Organics are capitalizing on the opportunity and expanding.
With Black consumers consistently spending a substantial portion of their income on beauty products that are targeted specifically for their hair, the companies that manufacture those products are able to build a loyal consumer base, as Mielle Organics has.

The company, which started out with a focus on natural hair, has never designated a specific race that can or cannot use their products, according to Monique Rodriguez, 39, who founded Mielle Organics in 2014.
“I get and understand the frustration of Black women and why they want to protect an item,” Ms. Rodriguez said in a recent interview. “I think that everyone should be able to use whatever product they choose to use if it works for their hair. I’m not going to discriminate against what race should use it.”

Ten years ago, when Ms. Rodriguez began experimenting with different food products to concoct hair conditioners for her own “severely” heat-damaged hair, she was looking for something that was not yet available in the small “ethnic hair care” sections in stores, she said.
She began sharing her experiments on natural-hair forums, where she found that other women were looking for similar products as well.
“I would share different tips and educational content that was helping my hair, and I saw that it was helping a lot of other women that were dealing with different hair challenges,” Ms. Rodriguez said.
She quickly became an influencer in the natural hair orbit. Soon, she said, women in the natural-hair forums started to ask where they could buy her creations. Ms. Rodriguez, who had been working as a registered nurse for 10 years by that time, decided to marry her science background with her passion for beauty products and create Mielle Organics (pronounced my-ELLE).
“I had the light-bulb moment, and I decided that I would take it seriously and create products that I felt were natural and affordable for our consumers,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “I saw an unmet need in the market. I saw that there was a void, a lack of availability, education and product accessibility.”

It was that void that pushed Ms. Tshiela, the law student, to create a video in response to Mielle’s hair growth oil becoming a social media trend. The video met a chilly reception on Twitter and TikTok, where many users told her that she was overreacting, she recalled.

Ms. Rodriguez said that Mielle’s recently announced acquisition by Procter & Gamble would help the company beef up its product distribution.

“The history of Black hair in this country refutes the claim that it’s just hair or it’s just hair-care products,” Ms. Tshiela said. “There is legislation that has moved through Congress to protect natural hair, to protect protective hairstyles. So when people say it’s just hair, they’re just hair products, it doesn’t make sense because it doesn’t match reality.”
The potential of Black hair care companies has caught the attention of the consumer-goods giant Procter & Gamble, which announced in January that it had bought Mielle Organics. The company now operates as an independent subsidiary within P&G Beauty, with Ms. Rodriguez and her husband, Melvin, serving as chief executive and chief operating officer.
Ms. Rodriguez said she hoped that working with Procter & Gamble would help allay customers’ anxieties about the availability of Mielle products.
“P&G will act as a resource to help us scale and increase our product distribution,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “We will be able to have more access to African American communities and will have the ability to innovate faster.”
For consumers like Ms. Tshiela, greater availability can make a real difference in a space where social media trends can move the needle on consumer behavior in ways that are hard to predict.

“The people who actually need these products, the people who don’t have anywhere else to turn, are unable to access these products, because of overconsumption and because of the influencer culture,” Ms. Tshiela said. “Not every product is meant for everybody.”"

2023-05-01,"In a 2021 episode of “What We Do in the Shadows,” the ancient vampire Nandor goes to Atlantic City and is smitten with a slot machine themed on “The Big Bang Theory.” Later, he’s amazed to discover that “The Big Bang Theory” is also a TV show. “Very faithful to the slot machine!” he marvels.
There is not yet a series based on a slot machine — that I know of. But Nandor is on to something: TV today is full of Things Based on Other Things. Films have become TV series (including “Shadows,” an adaptation of a 2015 movie), as have books and superhero comics and podcasts and manga and video games.
Nandor is on to something else too. “Faithfulness” has become a watchword for adaptations, sometimes a measure of authenticity, sometimes a billy club to police divergences from a favorite story.
It’s a term that raises a lot of unanswered questions: Faithful to what, or whom? Do fans of the original work have more of a claim on the adaptation than everyone else? Can you be faithful and creative at the same time — and do people asking for faithfulness even want that? Or do they simply want obedience?
In its recent rebranding presentation, Max (the streaming service now known as HBO Max, which downsizes its name later this month) announced a slate of programming full of Things Based on Other Things. Along with a new “Game of Thrones” prequel adapted from novellas by George R.R. Martin, a series version of the horror movie “The Conjuring” and a “Big Bang Theory” spinoff (congrats, Nandor!), Max confirmed plans for a series repurposing one of Warner Bros. Discovery’s most valuable properties, the Harry Potter books.
Much of the response focused, understandably, on the news that J.K. Rowling would produce the adaptation despite the controversy — even among many Potter fans — over her criticisms of “the new trans activism.” But another curiosity in Max’s attempt to squeeze more blood from the sorcerer’s stone was its description of the series as “a faithful adaptation.”

2023-05-02,"Just hours after the union representing thousands of television and movie writers announced that they were going on strike, hundreds of their members occupied an entire city block in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday.
Gathered outside an NBCUniversal event on Fifth Avenue, the writers chanted “No contract, no content” and held up signs with slogans like “Pencils Down!!!” and “Spoiler Alert: We Will Win.”
“These companies are absolutely destroying our industry,” Tony Kushner, the acclaimed playwright and a screenwriter of movies like “Lincoln” and “The Fabelmans,” said from the picket line, referring to Hollywood studios.

It was a noisy show of solidarity, echoed on picket lines outside the major studios in Los Angeles. But the immediate fallout of the strike — which shattered 15 years of labor peace in the entertainment industry and will bring much of Hollywood’s production assembly line to a halt — was felt most acutely in the world of late-night television, which immediately went dark.

On Tuesday afternoon, NBC issued a statement that the upcoming edition of the “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” would be a repeat from April. “Late Night With Seth Meyers” canceled a show that was supposed to feature an interview with the actress Rachel Weisz, replacing it with a rerun from February.
New episodes from late-night shows hosted by Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel have also been suspended. “Saturday Night Live” canceled a new episode scheduled for this weekend with Pete Davidson as host. NBC said it would “air repeats until further notice,” raising the possibility that the show will not be able to end its 48th season with a finale.
How long late-night talk shows stay off the air is an open question. During the last strike, in 2007, late-night shows gradually came back after about two months, even with their writers still on picket lines. (That strike lasted 100 days.)
Mr. Kimmel, ABC’s late-night host, was paying his staff out of pocket during that strike, and he said years later that he had to return to air because he had nearly drained his life savings.

David Letterman, who owned his CBS late-night show through his production company Worldwide Pants, made a deal with the Writers Guild of America that allowed his writers to come back on the show.
The World of Late-Night TV
The Rise of Taylor Tomlinson: The young stand-up comedian has rapidly emerged as one of the most in-demand superstars in comedy. Her latest gig, “After Midnight,” is an unconventional late-night show.
Jon Stewart Has Skills: The comedian has always had a sharp Borscht Belt approach, but only in his return to “The Daily Show” can we see how he wields this style so expertly.
Trevor Noah’s Legacy: In 2015, the South African comedian took on the mantle of “Daily Show” host from Stewart. In the seven years that followed, he was responsible for widening late night’s field of vision.
A Passion for Late-Night TV: Trish Bendix, who writes our Best of Late Night column, reflected on years of watching and covering talk shows that air after dark.
The other hosts — whose shows were owned by media companies — had no such luck. Hosts like Mr. Kimmel and Conan O’Brien returned without their writers, and gamely tried to put together their shows without their standard monologues. Mr. O’Brien had to resort to time-killing gimmicks, such as spinning his wedding ring on his desk, setting a timer to it in the process.
Jay Leno, the host of “The Tonight Show,” infuriated W.G.A. officials by writing his own monologue jokes. “A Jew, a Christian and a Muslim walk into a bar,” Mr. Leno said during his opening monologue, which stretched nearly 10 minutes. “The Jew says to the Muslim, see, I have no idea what they say, because there’s a writers’ strike.”

Late-night hosts and their top producers have been on group calls in recent weeks, coordinating a response in the event of a strike, according to a person briefed on the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Unlike the enmity of the so-called late-night wars from the 1990s, the hosts have made a concerted effort to show that they are on friendly, if still competitive, terms. When James Corden signed off from “The Late Late Show” last week, there was a taped segment that featured Mr. Colbert, Mr. Fallon, Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Meyers all together.
Mr. Meyers, the host of NBC’s 12:30 a.m. show, alluded to the devastation of the last strike in a segment late last week.
“It doesn’t just affect the writers,” Mr. Meyers said in the web-only video. “It affects all the incredible nonwriting staff on these shows.”
He added that he was a proud member of the W.G.A., and that he felt strongly that what the writers were asking for was “not unreasonable.”

“If you don’t see me here next week, know that it is something that is not done lightly, and that I will be heartbroken to miss you as well,” he said.
The strike would have to stretch for a significantly longer time before viewers began to see the effects on scripted TV shows and movies, because the production process for them can take months or more than a year. But the mere fact that many productions suddenly stopped was a blow to an industry already rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.

The biggest issue for the writers is pay. They have said that their compensation has stagnated even as television production has rapidly grown over the past decade. The unions representing the writers, the East and West branches of the Writers Guild of America, said “the companies’ behavior has created a gig economy inside a union work force, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing.”
W.G.A. leaders have called this moment “existential,” arguing that the “the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said in a statement shortly before the strike was announced that its offer included “generous increases in compensation for writers.”
The primary sticking points, according to the studios, involve union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time “whether needed or not.”
Chris Keyser, a chair of the W.G.A. negotiating committee, said in an interview early Tuesday morning that “philosophically, and practically, we’re very far apart.”
Over the last decade, a period that is often referred to as Peak TV, the number of scripted television shows broadcast in the United States has risen sharply. Writers, however, said that their pay has stagnated.
In the network television era, a writer could get work on a show with more than 20 episodes a season, providing a steady living for an entire year. However, in the streaming era, episode orders have declined to 8 or 12, and the median weekly pay for a writer-producer has gone down slightly, the W.G.A. said.

“They’re making it impossible for younger writers to make a living,” Mr. Kushner, the playwright and screenwriter, said. “Our wages have declined since the last strike.”
The writers want to also fix the formula for residual payments, which have been upended by streaming. Years ago, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed — into syndication or through DVD sales. But global streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have cut off those distribution arms and pay a fixed residual instead.
For now, the writers’ creative energy will be solely dedicated to their picket signs. Outside the NBCUniversal event, one writer held up a sign that read, “Pay your writers or we’ll spoil ‘Succession.’”

2023-05-03,"Howard University, the renowned historically Black institution that was founded to educate freed slaves, has selected a historian of Latin America as its next president, as the university’s leaders hope to continue its trajectory of surging enrollment and research growth.
Ben Vinson III, who has served as provost of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland since 2018, was chosen to be the 18th president of Howard, a 156-year-old university in Washington, D.C., that counts Vice President Kamala Harris, the former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and the author Toni Morrison among its alumni. He will assume the post on Sept. 1.
The move, announced by the university on Tuesday, comes at an energized time for Howard, which has scored a series of wins in recent years, including record research expenditures and high-profile academic hires. Dr. Vinson will need to keep up the momentum, as well as deal with students who have staged sit-ins and protested conditions at the university.
“Dr. Vinson is the right leader to usher Howard into its next era,” Leslie Hale, vice chair of the university’s board of trustees, said in a statement. “As a historian, he reveres the Howard legacy and brings a bold perspective of where Howard University should sit within the upper echelon of academic institutions.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Some faculty members said his selection was a surprise, objecting to the search process. Dr. Marcus Alfred, an associate professor of physics and astronomy and chair of the faculty senate, said the university limited the faculty senate’s participation. And he said that in a break from the past, the university community was not given the opportunity to meet with the finalists.
In the last few years, Howard University has appointed high-profile figures like Stacey Abrams, the politician and voting rights activist, and the journalists Nikole Hannah-Jones and Ta-Nehisi Coates to its faculty.
University leaders have said they hope the institution can become the first historically Black college to break into the select group of institutions with the highest research expenditures. In October, the university announced that it had raised $122 million in research grants and contracts, a record.
Last year, the university announced that it would spend $785 million to build three new academic halls and renovate other buildings, a move that officials at the time described as the product of “unprecedented financial strength.”
Wayne A.I. Frederick, who said last year that he would step down as president of the university, called the facilities investment a “watershed moment.” Officials described it at the time as the biggest real-estate investment in the university’s history, driven partly by increased enrollment.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
They also credited increased public and philanthropic investment. In 2020, the university announced that it had received a $40 million gift from MacKenzie Scott, the former wife of Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon.
Even so, students have been impatient for change. In 2021, they held sit-ins and slept in tents to protest housing shortages and poor living conditions in the dorms, a concern common to many historically Black universities with aging buildings. After a standoff lasting more than a month, students reached an agreement with Howard and ended the protest.
Dr. Vinson’s academic field makes a sharp contrast with that of Dr. Frederick, the outgoing president, who is a Howard-trained surgeon. The university search committee and trustees turned next to a historian, with his focus cast outside of the United States.
Dr. Vinson is a scholar of the African diaspora with an eye especially on colonial Latin America. He is the author of several books, including “Before Mestizaje: The Frontiers of Race and Caste in Colonial Mexico.”
Dr. Vinson, 52, spent his childhood on military bases in Italy, where his father was a master sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. He has previously served as the founding director of the Center for Africana Studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he also taught history, and as dean of George Washington University’s liberal arts and sciences college.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The chairman of the Howard board of trustees, Laurence C. Morse, said in a news release that Dr. Vinson had “demonstrated his commitment to elevating the diversity of experiences of people of the African diaspora — a commitment that aligns well with Howard University’s mission and vision.”Mr. Morse did not respond to an interview request.
In a statement, the president of Case Western Reserve, Eric W. Kaler, credited Dr. Vinson with leading development of that university’s ambitious strategic plan and new general education requirements, and with increasing diversity in its faculty and graduate student recruitment. President Kaler also said that Dr. Vinson was a strong supporter of the humanities at a time when some universities were cutting back on them.
“He is an exceptionally warm and empathetic person and will be a great leader for Howard,” he said."

Regional bank stocks are sinking in premarket trading.

PacWest plunges as banking woes spread
The regional banking sector is teetering again, with PacWest’s stock plummeting more than 35 percent in premarket trading, despite the Fed chair Jay Powell’s assessment that the worst is over.
The Los Angeles-based lender confirmed that it was talking to potential investors following reports that it was exploring a sale. Investors may be feeling some déjà vu after witnessing two big bank failures, and billions in market value wiped out, since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March.
It’s not just PacWest in free-fall. Shares in Western Alliance, Comerica and Zions Bancorp were down sharply too, even as S&P 500 futures were down only slightly after the Fed signaled it may be done raising interest rates.
News of a potential PacWest sale, first reported by Bloomberg — and confirmed by DealBook — came just hours after Mr. Powell declared that the banking system was “sound and resilient.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Despite Mr. Powell’s reassurances, big questions remain. Among them: Can regional banks like PacWest find a private-sector solution? Or will regulators again need to step in?
The fix is tricky, as was made clear by First Republic’s monthlong search for a rescuer. JPMorgan Chase bought the lender only after it had been seized by the F.D.I.C. PacWest appears healthy, with deposits — 75 percent of which are insured — ticking up since the end of March. But it needs to raise capital, and fast.
Selling its depressed stock would be costly for PacWest. That could further spook depositors and investors, and play into the hands of the short sellers targeting the sector. Meanwhile, a fire sale of assets, including loans (the bank’s $2.7 billion lender finance loan portfolio is on the block) and securities pegged at low interest rates, may not fetch much. Finally, selling itself could be tough, and not only because the pool of potential buyers has narrowed significantly since the JPMorgan-First Republic deal.
Criticism of the Fed and calls for regulatory action are growing. Mohamed El-Erian, an economist and an adviser at Allianz, accused Powell of confusing the markets by saying the sector’s problems had largely been contained with the sale of First Republic. And Bill Ackman, the billionaire investor, called on regulators to modernize the deposit insurance system to restore the public’s faith in regional lenders. (He added that his hedge fund was neither long nor short the banking sector.)

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Oil prices whipsaw in volatile trading. Benchmarks for crude rose on Thursday, but not enough to compensate for yesterday’s plunge, which was driven by investor concerns about slowing global demand. Meanwhile, Shell reported better-than-expected earnings, as lower costs and strong trading results offset lower oil and gas prices.
Jamie Dimon reportedly may testify about Jeffrey Epstein later this month. A deposition of JPMorgan Chase’s C.E.O., as part of two lawsuits over the bank’s ties to the convicted sex offender, is set for May 26 and 27, according to CNBC. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reports that Mr. Epstein had previously unreported meetings with Larry Summers and the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Mr. Epstein’s private islands were sold for $60 million.
Goldman Sachs reportedly seeks to settle a discrimination lawsuit. The Wall Street bank has held discussions about paying several hundred million dollars to resolve accusations that it systematically discriminated against female employees, The Wall Street Journal reports. A trial in the case is set for next month.
The U.A.W. withholds an endorsement of President Biden. The United Auto Workers, one of America’s most powerful unions, said it was concerned about the White House’s plans for an “electric vehicle transition,” though it hasn’t ruled out backing him later in the 2024 race. It’s a sign of how Mr. Biden’s climate change policies may cost him support from a key constituency.

The F.T.C. and Meta face off
Meta and the F.T.C. have escalated their fight over how the social media giant handles its users’ data. Meta accused the agency and its chair, Lina Khan, of pulling a “political stunt” after it moved to impose “a blanket prohibition” on the company’s collection of personal data from young people.
The agency has come down hard on Meta before for its handling of users’ data. In 2020, it imposed a $5 billion consent order and forced Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, to overhaul its privacy practices. The F.T.C. said yesterday that the company had failed to do so, accusing it of “recklessness” and of putting “young users at risk.”
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The potential penalties are stiff. Meta would be barred from profiting off any data it collects from users under 18, and regulators want that to be extended to 18-year-olds — a move that would limit how the company targets ads to young people.
Meta vowed to fight. “Despite three years of continual engagement with the F.T.C. around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,” the company said in a statement, adding that Ms. Khan’s “insistence on using any measure — however baseless — to antagonize American business has reached a new low.” The company has 30 days to appeal.

Congress is also targeting social networks. Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, yesterday reintroduced a bill to update the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. The lawmakers said in a statement that they were seeking to ban “targeted ads to kids, and stop all online platforms — not just Meta and other companies under F.T.C. consent decrees — from raking in profits through the exploitation of an entire generation.”
What to watch for in Apple’s earnings
Tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have beaten expectations this earnings season. Apple is up next and will report after the closing bell on Thursday. Here are some of the biggest things to watch for.
Stock buybacks: Investors expect Apple, which has spent more money repurchasing shares than any other company, to keep that up. The consensus number this quarter is $90 billion.
China: Nearly 25 percent of Apple’s revenue comes from China, and supply-chain disruptions there led to costly shortages. As the Chinese economy reopens after Covid, the iPhone maker’s sales should continue to recover, and Tim Cook, Apple’s chief, has said that production problems have subsided. But some analysts worry that the company remains overly dependent on China.

Artificial intelligence: Tech leaders have spent a lot of time on their earnings calls touting their progress in adding ChatGPT-like features to their products. Apple has been criticized for failing to keep up with the latest advances. Investors will be anxious to hear whether Cook lays out an expansive vision for the tech.
Governments step up A.I. oversight
Leaders of companies working on artificial intelligence, including Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI, will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, after the White House announced new initiatives to rein in the fast-growing technology.
It’s the latest sign that governments are seeking to tame A.I. as the tech world races to harness the power of products like ChatGPT — and critics warn that the technology threatens to reshape society in potentially negative ways.
White House officials pledged to release draft guidelines for A.I. use in government, to safeguard “the American people’s rights and safety.” The announcement comes a day after Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., called for tighter regulation of the technology.

International regulators are also making moves. The head of Britain’s competition overseer told The Financial Times that the agency would review the A.I. market, with an eye on potential guardrails to protect consumers and smaller companies. That follows plans by the European Union for some of the world’s most sweeping legislation to regulate A.I.
In other A.I. news:
Security engineers at Meta warned of potentially dangerous ChatGPT impostors.
A start-up let users interact with ChatGPT via a female avatar. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that didn’t go well.
A.I. can do many things; can it also be an emotional support companion?
HSBC prepares for an investor showdown over China
At HSBC’s annual meeting on Friday in Birmingham, England, the focus will be on one topic: whether to break up the bank, which is Europe’s biggest. HSBC management argues that the lender benefits from its integrated global operation. But the firm’s largest shareholder, the Chinese insurer Ping An, wants HSBC to spin out its main Asian operations.
Though a shareholder initiative to force HSBC to regularly review its structure may fail on Friday, the pressure on the bank to rethink its future won’t let up anytime soon.
HSBC’s China-facing business accounts for nearly half of its revenue — but Ping An says the division has been held back by having to subsidize its slower-growing Western operations. Asian investors were also angered by a 2020 edict by the Bank of England that British banks stop paying quarterly dividends. (HSBC said this week that it would restart those payouts.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Last month, Ping An responded to management’s objections by suggesting the less drastic step of giving the Asian business, which is based in Hong Kong, its own stock listing.
HSBC remains unconvinced. Executives have said a breakup risks disrupting what is a well-performing business, and pointed to their efforts to shed nonessential operations like retail banking in North America. A better-than-expected earnings report on Tuesday helped buttress their arguments.
The fight will likely extend beyond Friday. Though HSBC is expected to win the vote on the shareholder proposal, analysts concede that HSBC will face increasing pressure from worsening tensions between Beijing and the West.
Given that Ping An hasn’t shown any desire to walk away, expect the fight over HSBC’s future to continue.

Before you ask, no, I don’t have any Bluesky invite codes. I’m sorry.
Or perhaps you have no idea what I’m talking about. That’s cool, I got you: Bluesky is a buzzy social media platform funded by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey that is being hailed by some as a potential alternative to the troubled bird app.
Wait, weren’t we just talking about another buzzy social media platform being hailed as a potential Twitter alternative?
Yes, good memory. That was a platform called Mastodon. We’ve moved on to Bluesky these days. Next month, it’ll probably be something else. Apologies in advance.
Compared to its competitors, Bluesky has simplicity going for it. The app, which is currently invite only — hence the codes — is easy enough to figure out if you have spent any time using Twitter over the years. It feels familiar.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
(My colleague Sheera Frenkel wrote a great Bluesky explainer if you’re looking for a quick primer.)
I joined Bluesky last week after tweeting a request for an access code. (It’s not lost on me that I got said code via the app Bluesky is trying to replace.)
Mostly, I’ve just been watching. I haven’t posted yet. Sorry, I mean I haven’t skeeted yet. Posts are being called “skeets” by users, despite pleas from the CEO Jay Graber to call them literally anything else. (Sky + tweets = skeets.) “Hear me out, call the QTs skee-balls,” skeeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among the most famous early adopters of the platform.
So far, it’s been fairly fun. My feed is a lot of memes and bits and gags.
Bluesky has a feed for people you are following as well as a general “What’s hot” feed. Here’s what skeets crossed my path during a ten minute scroll on Thursday afternoon.
A picture of a particularly good looking ice cream cone with no context. A screenshotted quote from Herman Melville about the cruelty of humanity. Jake Tapper skeeting a picture of Baby Yoda, and a fake account for the rapper Ice Spice skeeting a picture of real Yoda. (It was May the fourth.) Several pictures of dogs from Twitter’s @Darth. Random selfies. Someone excitedly skeeting about the iconic meme account @DaShareZ0ne joining the platform. Chelsea Manning suggesting somebody send Ted Cruz an invite and right below that a genuinely nice thread of people offering kind words and advice for a terminally-ill cat.
It has an energy some have compared to that of the early days of Twitter. Many of these comparisons are being made … back over on Twitter. It’s seems counterintuitive, but this is often how new social networks gain critical mass. Or at least try to.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But, still, I’m not terribly compelled to move from observer to active participant. Maybe it’s platform fatigue. Maybe it’s the fact that I first wrote about Mastodon as a potential Twitter killer [checks calendar] five years ago and fool me twice. Or maybe it’s just hard not to get cynical about the cycle of events that seems all but inevitable on emerging social platforms.
The things that initially make a platform weird and fun all too frequently end up getting weaponized by bad actors. And then there is, of course, the omnipresent question of what to do about content moderation. (Wired has an interesting piece detailing how Bluesky already has run afoul when it comes to nudes. And not in the way you might expect!)
I’m going to keep watching, though — waiting and hoping someone has finally cracked the code on building the platform to end all platforms. If you’re still interested in getting in early, I hear you can buy a code on eBay if you have $400 to burn.

One of my favorite things about TikTok — and the thing that keeps me coming back for hours a day every week despite my better judgment — is the hyperspecificity of its algorithm. There’s a niche for everyone and everything. There are the familiar genres you might expect like Food Tok, Cleaning Tok, and Book Tok, but also ones you might not, like my newfound obsession, Hoof Tok. That last one is an oddly satisfying and occasionally disgusting world of videos of people trimming down horse hooves. Like I said, something for everyone.

2023-05-09,"LinkedIn, the networking platform used by millions of employees and companies, said on Monday it will pare down its operations in China, capping a multiyear pullback that exemplified the challenges of running a foreign business in China.
The company, owned by Microsoft, said it will lay off 716 employees worldwide, including teams dedicated to engineering and marketing in China, because of slumping demand. It did not say how many of those layoffs will be in China.
LinkedIn will also shut its China job posting app, a bare-bones version of its international service, by August. Users of the app, called InCareer, could only search for jobs and not post or share articles the way they can on LinkedIn.
When LinkedIn started a Chinese-language version of its website in 2014, it charted a path that its peers, including Facebook and Google, had shied away from. It partnered with local firms and began censoring the content of millions of Chinese customers in accordance with Beijing’s strict laws. Several U.S. journalists and activists said their profiles had been blocked because of “prohibited content.” The company said at the time that while it opposed government censorship, its absence in the country could deprive Chinese professionals of the chance to make professional connections.

Yet over the years, the challenges for foreign and domestic social media platforms multiplied as the power of China’s censorship machine ballooned under its leader, Xi Jinping. In 2021, LinkedIn closed its flagship networking service in China, citing compliance issues and a “significantly more challenging operating environment.”
In a letter to employees, Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn’s chief executive, said the cuts were prompted by slower revenue growth and fluctuations in customer behavior. The news follows an overall slowdown in tech that has led to tens of thousands of layoffs this year by the largest companies, including Amazon, Meta and Google.
LinkedIn, which employs about 20,000 people, said Monday that while it was reducing operations in China and other countries, it plans to create 250 jobs in other areas.
Mr. Roslansky said it will retain a presence in China to help companies operating in the country hire and train employees from overseas."
2023-05-10,"WHEN I RETURNED my rental car at the airport in Calama, I’d driven 1,499 miles through the Atacama Desert, drawing a zigzag through Chile’s far north. The driest place on earth — vying with parts of Antarctica — the Atacama covers an area of 40,000 to 49,000 square miles, depending on how inclusive your definition is, and stretches along 700 to 1,000 miles of Pacific coastline. It’s a place defined by absence, or at least extreme sparseness. Of water, of life. Whatever is determined enough to exist there — people, plants, animals, even microbes — must be hardy, resilient and well adapted. From the road, I’d seen life hanging on. I’d ventured into the desert and also seen what dryness preserves (bones, ruins) and what it exposes (mineral riches, the stars).

Three writers go to extremes with journeys to the driest, darkest and cattiest places on earth.
- Hello, Kitties: In Japan, cats are revered, adored and sometimes seen as actual demons. What’s at the root of their mythic power?
- Darkness Visible: After the sun vanishes in Svalbard, Norway, one starts to see strange things in the polar night.
- Dust to Dust: What a road trip through Chile’s Atacama Desert — one of the world’s driest places — reveals about life and death.
In the Calama departures hall, a dog slept stretched out on a bench while a group of men sat on their luggage rather than disturb him. Almost everyone lined up at check-in was a man. Chuquicamata, the world’s largest open-pit copper mine, a hole big enough to swallow Central Park, is nine miles north of the city. Miners flow in and out of the area, some working a week on, a week off. “The whole landscape seems to concentrate, giving a feeling of suffocation across the plain,” writes Che Guevara in “The Motorcycle Diaries” (1993), his posthumously published account of traveling through South America in the early 1950s. Underground mining at Chuquicamata began in 2019, chasing deposits depleted by more than a century of extraction. From the highway, I’d passed terraced slag mountains, visible through a dusty haze, a full-scale topography of used-up earth. There used to be a company town just outside the pit with over 20,000 residents but, in the aughts, mainly to comply with pollution regulations, the state-run firm that operates the mine built 3,000 houses in Calama and relocated everyone. I’d driven through one of these neighborhoods. The streets were almost eerily quiet, a dream of suburban tidiness dropped into a landscape of stark and immaculate harshness.

There is a long history of habitation and abandonment in the Atacama, of boomtowns and ghost towns. In places so barren that human survival seemed preposterous, I drove past rambling derelict buildings, remnants of the once-thriving 19th-century nitrate mining industry. The desert highways had a feeling of hauntedness, of something missing or hidden. Not far from Calama, I’d driven past a memorial to 26 people murdered in 1973 by General Augusto Pinochet’s killing squad known as the Caravan of Death, their bodies buried in a mass grave, then dug up and dispersed. Crushed bone fragments were discovered on the site in 1990 by family members who’d combed the desert for years. I’d passed a field of revolving turbines and a lonely black sea of solar panels. Wind and sun are abundant in the Atacama; water is noteworthy.

Look between your shoes while standing here and you will see parched sand and rock. Look at the same land from an airplane and distance reveals the ghost of water, the branching etchings and furrows of desiccated riverbeds and arroyos. The ginkgo leaf shapes of alluvial fans spread at mountains’ feet. So arid and scoured by UV radiation are the driest regions of the Atacama that NASA engineers and astrobiologists use parts of its near rainless interior, known as the hyperarid core, as analogues for Mars, places to test rovers and instruments and to study its hardiest bacteria and fungi for clues as to where Martian microbial life might exist or have existed. The Atacama is a figurative window into space, a metaphor for another planet, but it’s a literal window, too: The combination of its extreme dryness, relative emptiness and areas of high elevation give the Atacama the clearest, darkest night sky anyone can reliably find on earth. For that reason, other nations have spent billions of dollars building large, advanced telescopes here, with more under construction.
Before setting out for my 10-day road trip this past January, I planned a meandering itinerary to explore the desert’s gamut, from the ocean to the mountains and through its forbidding heart. For thousands of years, people have confronted this inhospitable place and taken what they could from it. I wanted to know what happens when human beings are determined to make something out of nothingness.

CALAMA WAS MY last mile, and Arica was my first. Just south of the Peruvian border, Arica is a port city and a desert city, pressed between the vast wetness of the Pacific and the vast dryness of the Atacama. I landed there after midnight, and from the taxi into town I spotted colorful letters illuminated by floodlights on a beach: “Chinchorro.” Around 1915, a German archaeologist, Max Uhle, discovered mummified human remains on that beach; researchers later gave its name, a Spanish word meaning “fishing net” or “small boat,” to the prehistoric culture to which the relics belonged.

Residents of Arica undoubtedly knew about the mummies before Uhle came along. The city is like a necropolis, an anthropologist would tell me the next day. Dig anywhere and you might find bones. There are stories about kids playing football with skulls and dogs digging up desiccated human bits. Construction crews unearthing bones is not a shock. Arica has been the site of human habitation for something like 9,000 years and, with little humidity to feed decay, the desert keeps the evidence. In and around Arica there are the modern dead, and there are dead from the 1880 battle in which Chile won the city from Peru during the Saltpeter War, fought over nitrate deposits; there are dead from the 1868 tsunami and from the era two centuries prior, when Arica was the endpoint of a Spanish caravan route bringing silver out of what is now Bolivia; there are Inca-era dead and pre-Incan dead, dating back to when the Chinchorro arrived from no one quite knows where — similar coastal communities farther north, or the highlands or both — and gradually spread out over 400 miles of Chilean shoreline.

While debates persist over which region is the world’s driest — the Atacama or Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys — the former is undeniably the driest nonpolar desert. Mean annual precipitation in its hyperarid core is 0.004 inches. In some places, no rain has ever been recorded, but the climate at the desert’s edges is more moderate. Moisture reaches its eastern Andean fringe as rain from the Amazon basin or occasional snow, and its coast in the form of a dense oceanic fog with enough heft to merit a proper name, Camanchaca. The fog supports oases of cactuses and Tillandsia, better known as air plants, and also — though the practice has yet to be implemented on a large scale — human enterprise. In some communities where water must be trucked in, simple contraptions of plastic or steel mesh called fog catchers have enabled agricultural and reforestation projects. In the town of Peña Blanca, just south of the Atacama, fog provides water to a microbrewery.
While temperatures in some parts of the Atacama can fall below freezing in winter, overall the climate is relatively mild, particularly along the coast. For the Chinchorro, who wore only breechcloths or grass skirts and lived in shelters with roofs made of reeds or sea mammal skins, this temperate area with access to abundant marine food sources — fish, shellfish, birds, sea lions — must have seemed as much like paradise as anywhere could for prehistoric hunter-gatherers.

The clerk at my hotel had waited up. He told me when breakfast was served and where to flee in case of a tsunami. (Basically, uphill.) “You will hear the sirens,” he said. “They are very loud.” The hotel, a minimalist, lightly corroded sort of place, was on the beach. In the moonlight, from my balcony, I saw a dead seal rolling in the water, but by morning it was gone. Hundreds of chatty gulls and terns crowded on the rocks, a few redheaded turkey vultures standing among them. Offshore, fishing boats promenaded past, noses in the air, and returned heavier the other way. At the city’s southern edge, an imposing plant turned fish oil into omega-3 supplements.

At night, I hadn’t been able to see how the city is hemmed in by sand. A rocky promontory called the Morro de Arica is the city’s towering, unmissable landmark, but the lower encircling hills are veneered with smooth, wind-contoured dunes. I walked along the waterfront and then up a steep residential street to the Museo de Sitio Colón 10 to meet the anthropologist Bernardo Arriaza, a world expert on the Chinchorro. From the outside, the museum still looks like the ordinary flat-roofed private house it once was. Inside, there is a glass floor over sandy dirt from which bones protrude. A developer had bought the house with plans to build a hotel in the early 2000s, but the first soil studies had unearthed a mummy, then another — eventually about 50, some naturally desiccated, others elaborately mummified by human hands. Because the remains were so numerous and so delicate, Arica’s Universidad de Tarapacá bought the building and left them in place.
The first Atacaman generations may have grown accustomed to buried bodies turning to husks, naturally mummified by the desert’s heat, dryness and high salt content. In such an arid world, the dead could linger. Perhaps the Chinchorro concluded that the dead were supposed to linger, that desiccation meant something important, that the preservation of bodies would mollify the souls of the dead. In any event, two millenniums before the earliest Egyptian mummies appeared, the Chinchorro started to artificially mummify their dead. “To me,” Arriaza said, “what is most intriguing is that they use the body as a canvas and create this artistic representation of the dead: of the individual and also of the feelings of the living.” Chinchorro mummies resemble sculptures or effigies. If you were a Chinchorro mortuary specialist living around 4000 B.C., this is what you would do when someone died: Dismember the corpse. Deflesh the body but preserve the skin. Clean the bones. Reassemble the skeleton and bulk it out with reeds and twigs, forming an armature over which you spread a thick layer of clay, sculpting the lost body. Press the person’s skin (or sea lion skin, in a pinch) back on, and paint it with black manganese or, in later eras, red ocher. Use clay and paint to build up the face until it resembles a stylized mask, flat and oval, and then incise eyes and a mouth. Give the skull a wig of human hair.

The Chinchorro, unlike the Egyptians, mummified people of all ages and across social classes. About 70 miles south of Arica, the Camarones valley is the burial site of the oldest known mummies, all infants and children. There you can stand on soil flecked with shell fragments, refuse of the mollusk-heavy Chinchorro diet, and see bones crumbling out of the ground, along with layers of the reed mats used to wrap the dead. Arriaza suspects the initial impetus to mummify here may have had to do with high rates of stillbirths and infant mortality caused by arsenic poisoning — the Chinchorro wouldn’t have known it at the time, but the Camarones River contains dangerously high levels of arsenic, leached from volcanic rock, roughly 100 times the World Health Organization’s recommended amount. He suggests that parents turned to mummification to preserve their children and assuage their grief. “Mothers and fathers painting the little ones, taking care of them — and then the practice starts to spread,” he said. For more than 3,000 years, the Chinchorro mummified their dead. And then, for reasons just as unknowable as why the practice began, it faded away.

I PICKED UP my rental car and left Arica, turning south onto the Pan-American Highway. This way to Tierra del Fuego, that way to Alaska. A sign warned that the next gas station was in 266 kilometers, or 165 miles. One hour farther south, I reached the Pampa del Tamarugal, the Atacama’s elevated interior plain. Dust devils spun up into the sky. Here and there I passed sprawling complexes of roofless mud-brick barracks. A cemetery bristled with rusting, tilted crosses. At the turn of the 20th century near this 200-mile segment of Chile, through the region of Tarapacá, there were more than 100 nitrate processing plants, oficinas, ranging from tiny homespun operations to those with substantial company towns. Synthetic alternatives began to replace mined nitrates in the 1910s and, over the next few decades, the oficinas were abandoned. The natural hostility of the desert sometimes seems almost to invite careless or destructive human behavior, as though all were permissible (or perhaps invisible) in a place so harsh. The ruins of an oficina, Chacabuco, were repurposed between 1973 and 1975 as one of the largest concentration camps of the dictatorship, holding more than a thousand people.
On one straight, flat 10-mile stretch of the Pan-American Highway, I counted 17 roadside memorials. They’re everywhere in Chile. Some are simple crosses. Others are little roofed structures called animitas. They might be the size of a mailbox or doghouse, or big enough to accommodate plastic chairs for visitors. Some see them as shelters for souls separated violently from their bodies, others as places where the living can pray to the dead for intercession with the divine. In the animitas I saw candles, Virgin Marys, beer bottles, soccer balls, Chilean flags, plastic flowers, bicycles, tinsel, models of tow trucks and tanker trucks, painted murals. Sometimes poster-size photos of the dead were mounted outside, their faces faded to blankness by the sun. I thought if I died on this road, crushed by one of the countless trucks, my soul would not choose to linger.

South of Iquique — a “Star Wars” city of gleaming white waterfront apartment towers and jumbled, humbler neighborhoods set against a huge red sand dune — the highway nestled into the crease where the coastal range meets the sea, the nothingness of sand and rock punctuated only by fishing villages and immense, inscrutable industrial sites. Occasionally I passed locals parked on the shoulder or the beach to collect kelp, heaving ropy black bundles into the beds of their pickup trucks. Tankers and semi trucks swarmed around the mining facilities and power plants. Conveyor belts intruded into the ocean along girdered piers, spilling whatever had been dug out of the desert into waiting ships.
When I drove back inland, into the desert’s interior, the air was hot and so dusty I could taste it. The barrenness of the terrain was interrupted only by mines. Lithium evaporation ponds resembled gigantic green-and-blue eye shadow palettes — jade and aquamarine and cyan bordered with white banks of salt byproduct that rose in plumes with the wind. The Atacama already supplies a third of the world’s lithium, and both demand and production are increasing. Lithium is used for electric vehicle batteries, and a massive shift from gas-powered to electric vehicles is considered crucial in the fight to mitigate climate change. But lithium mining in Chile involves pumping huge amounts of groundwater out from under the desert, potentially damaging ecosystems. The quest for decarbonization may leave new scars on the Atacama.

San Pedro de Atacama, the desert’s tourist hub, is an isolated hot spot of human hustle. Every evening I was there, a wind kicked up before sunset and dropped off as soon as darkness fell. In the stillness, I could hear Andean flute music that segued, closer to midnight, into E.D.M. Like backpacker towns the world over, San Pedro is chockablock with guesthouses and pizzerias, cheerful but with an edge of competitive commerce. Mud-brick souvenir shops line its unpaved main street, bewildering in their sameness, selling copper jewelry and stacks of colorful knits, ponchos and pompom hats. San Pedro has been a human settlement for three thousand years, bordered by salt flats and sustained by runoff from the Andes. Just outside town, there is a place of spectacularly serrated red rock known as both the Valley of Mars and the Valley of Death. The story goes that a Belgian priest and local archaeologist who lived in town couldn’t distinguish the pronunciations of “Marte” and muerte.
In San Pedro, the Atacama’s aridity is an attraction, something to be ventured into from a comfortable home base. I looked at Instagram posts of people floating in turquoise salt lagoons and wondered if I wanted a photo of myself doing that. But online reviews warned of an hour’s drive on washboard roads, flat tires and incomplete signage. Instead, curious about the Atacama’s high-elevation borderlands, where moisture from rain and snow brings some semblance of habitability for more plants and animals, I drove up into the Reserva Nacional Los Flamencos.

For a while, the landscape was tufted with grass called paja brava, or “rough straw,” but as I passed 15,000 feet, everything became red and rocky and sere. At scenic overlooks, Sprinter vans disgorged tourists in performance outerwear. Small groups of wild vicuñas — camelids with periscope necks and sweet, long-lashed faces that live above 11,500 feet — grazed on dry, spiky vegetation. Vicuñas were sacred to the Inca, and only specially designated Virgins of the Sun were permitted to weave their exceptionally soft, insulating wool into garments for royal use. Today, vicuña wool is among the most expensive in the world, and associated with the collections of Italian fashion houses like Loro Piana. I stopped at a salt lake to watch Andean flamingos pick at algae in the shallows, the contrast of their black bills and flight feathers against their pale pinkness giving them a charming jauntiness, like gentlemen in spats. The sunlight at this altitude felt distilled, hundred proof. The backs of my hands stung from it. The local flamingo population has recently declined, probably because of the diminishing of groundwater that feeds the saline lagoons where the birds breed and feed. The cause of the groundwater depletion hasn’t yet been established, though the two obvious suspects are lithium mining and climate change.
In March 2015, severe rainstorms in the Atacama bringing floods and mudflows that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes made global news. The storms also proved how vulnerable the desert’s tiniest denizens are to precipitation. When lagoons of runoff formed in the hyperarid core, Spanish and Chilean researchers found that microbes in the soil — adapted to an arid environment — perished in the sudden influx of water. Heavy rain arrived again in August of that year, and there have been floods most years since then. In Los Angeles, where I live, rain can be a savior. But the Atacama’s extreme dryness is not a temporary problem waiting to be solved. Dryness is its essence.
After the rains, scientists found that one microbial ecosystem — the interiors of salt rocks — rebounded, albeit gradually. “What this is telling us is that those ecosystems are functionally very resilient,” Alfonso Davila, a NASA astrobiologist and one of the study’s researchers, said. But there are limits. The Atacama’s extreme aridity means that ecosystems there, even the ones too small to see, are existing at the edge of survival.

BY THE TIME I arrived at the European Southern Observatory site at Paranal, I could feel the dryness in my body. A headache nagged. The astronomers there said occasionally their skin itched; they didn’t sleep well. “Sometimes you look like a 100-year-old person,” said Florian Rodler, a 44-year-old staff astronomer originally from Austria. But the observatory, 80 miles south of the coastal city of Antofagasta, is one of the best sites in the world for looking into space. Its Very Large Telescope is perched at 8,645 feet atop an explosive-flattened mountaintop, where the atmosphere is relatively stable and incredibly dry. Almost 90 percent of the nights are clear. I asked about the most distant object the V.L.T. has seen, and Rodler answered in terms of time rather than space: a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, when the first galaxies were beginning to form. Everything we see in space is in the past. “Here we collect the light of the universe,” a Paranal engineer told me. The light from the moon takes 1.3 seconds to reach us. The sun’s light, about eight minutes. The nearest stars’, a little more than four years. From some stars, we are seeing light from when the Chinchorros were making their first mummies. From distant galaxies, the light collected by the V.L.T. was emitted long before the Earth was formed. Twelve miles away on another flattened mountaintop, E.S.O. is building a new telescope, the Extremely Large Telescope, which will be used for, among other purposes, hunting for exoplanets that might support life.
I spent the night in the residencia for scientific staff, a long, low structure built into the mountainside downhill from the V.L.T. that, in the James Bond film “Quantum of Solace” (2008), stands in for a Bolivian eco-hotel that gets spectacularly blown up. My room was simple, with a twin bed and a view onto the Mars-like red landscape. The main building has a large, translucent dome that lets in daylight but must be covered at night. For the sake of the telescopes, all light must be contained.
On my way back to the residencia, I stopped and looked up at the billowing arch of the Milky Way. The air was cold, clear and silent. The darkness was thick and velvety and, overhead, the universe receded and receded. The realm of the dead, the realm of the stars. It seems natural to want to connect the two, to draw a link between two great unknowns. The Atacama, for all its emptiness, is not a void. It is, through quirks of nature and accidents of human ingenuity, a bridge across the greatest void. The desert, in its dryness, keeps the dead and opens the sky.

2023-05-11,"The K-pop juggernaut BTS will release an oral history of the group in South Korea and the United States on July 9, its U.S. publisher, Flatiron Books, said on Thursday.
The book, “Beyond The Story: 10-Year Record of BTS,” was written by the journalist Myeongseok Kang and members of the group, and it will be published in South Korea by Big Hit Music.
The news confirms intense fan speculation over several days that Flatiron would publish a nonfiction title about a pop culture phenomenon this summer. The rumor spread once booksellers in the United States noticed last weekend that a mystery title with a July 9 release date was coming. It had an initial print run of one million copies and required booksellers to sign an affidavit to stock copies on publication day.
Fans searched for clues of who the mystery author might be, zeroing in at first on Taylor Swift and citing her frequent use of the number 13 as evidence. (The book’s original announcement was slated for June 13.) Swift had also highlighted the date July 9 in her most recent album announcement.

But June 13 and July 9 are also significant dates in the BTS community. The group debuted on the first date, and BTS’s passionate fan base, Army — which stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth — was founded on the second. The book’s release will coincide with the fan group’s 10th anniversary.
As speculations mounted, preorders drove the still-untitled book up best-seller lists at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.
The English translation of the book was led by Anton Hur, in collaboration with Clare Richards and Slin Jung. The U.S. edition will be 544 pages and contain exclusive photographs, according to Flatiron, and will have a first printing of one million copies.
The group’s powerful, very online fandom has become famous worldwide, known for supporting the group by buying multiple versions of each physical release and running intricately coordinated social media campaigns. Devotees also assist each other by translating BTS content into English and other languages and providing robust fan communities.
It is difficult to overstate BTS’s influence, in music and beyond. Last year, the seven members of the group — RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook — visited the White House to speak against anti-Asian American hate crimes.

Since 2013, BTS has released nine albums and six EPs and helped K-pop become a dominant global force. In 2018, the group became the first K-pop act to hit No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart with “Love Yourself: Tear,” a feat it repeated twice in 2019 with “Love Yourself: Answer” and “Map of the Soul: Persona” — matching a record set by the Beatles.
In June 2022, after yet another No. 1 album — the three-disc compilation “Proof” — BTS released a video on social media announcing it was going on hiatus so its members could focus on solo creative projects. “I should be writing about what I’m feeling and the stories I want to tell,” Suga said, “but I’m just forcefully squeezing out words because I need to satisfy someone.” The clip drew more than 16 million views in two days. In October of last year, the group’s label confirmed that its members would enlist in South Korea’s military as required by law. Some of them already have.
The hiatus was devastating news not only for BTS’s fervent fan base, but also for the entertainment business. The day after the news broke, the stock price for Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company behind the group, dropped 28 percent, which shaved $1.7 billion off its market value. As the group’s popularity has grown, it has become a pillar of South Korea’s economy, contributing $3.5 billion annually by 2020, according to the Hyundai Research Institute.
Many fans say that while they are drawn to BTS’s music and performances, they are also inspired by its messages of love and acceptance, which have led some to become more politically active. “They’re really, really passionate people who just fight for what they love,” Nicole Santero, a fan who ran a data-focused BTS Twitter account, told The Times in 2020. “Those characteristics translate well when you look at social issues.”

Today’s newsletter is a tale of two very different book sagas.
One involves Taylor Swift. The other is the story of  a little-known Twitter user with a risqué name who accidentally instigated the most delightful thing that’s happened on Twitter in [checks notes] a really long time. We’ll begin with the latter.
It goes like this: On Sunday, a Twitter account devoted to the anime series “Trigun”  tweeted the following plea to their followers:
*grabs you personally by the throat* you will do this. for me. you will go to the counter at barnes and noble. you will buy this. i will be greatly rewarded
— bigolas dickolas woIfwood (@maskofbun) May 7, 2023
The book “This Is How You Lose the Time War,” by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, was critically acclaimed when it was released in 2019, winning a Hugo Award for Best Novella the following year. (El-Mohtar is also a columnist who writes about sci-fi books for The Times.)
What happened next was surprising. Twitter is great for shitposting and — somewhat less recently — keeping up with the news, but isn’t historically so great at motivating users to do things IRL. In this case, though, the tweets appear to have motivated some people to actually go out and buy the book. “This Is How You Lose the Time War” rocketed up the Amazon charts, landing in the top ten.

“We are literally sandwiched between Barbara Kingsolver’s ‘Demon Copperhead' and Wendy Loggia’s ‘Taylor Swift: A Little Golden Book Biography,’” El-Mohtar told me.
Gladstone had just stepped off a plane for a family vacation when his phone started blowing up with notifications from people who had seen the tweet. El-Mohtar said her husband spotted it on his For You feed."

2023-05-15,"President Biden and Vice President Harris recently announced their re-election campaign, with the president saying “Let’s finish this job.” Among the accomplishments they will be running on are the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which are designed to help the nation restore its domestic supply chain for semiconductors, promote renewable energy and improve climate resilience.
This legislation may be necessary and will yield benefits and jobs for years to come, but it has had an unintended consequence, which is to trigger an expensive incentive war between localities — with taxpayer money as the sweetener for corporations. Some programs, like the CHIPS Act, require state and local subsides to access federal dollars. Other programs are indifferent to bidding wars across states and cities.
Offering tax breaks and other incentives to corporations has been proved to be one of the least effective ways for localities and states to grow their economies. Yet the Biden administration and Congress may incite destructive races to the bottom — unless they make some sensible tweaks to the laws.
The bidding wars started in August 2022 in Lockhart, Texas, which was competing for a new semiconductor factory for Micron. After comparing Lockhart’s proposal — which offered billions in tax exemptions and utility subsidies — with those from cities in North Carolina and New York, Micron chose to build in upstate New York. The state offered a staggering $5.5 billion in tax credits over the life of the project, assuming Micron meets employment targets.
This type of gamesmanship is bad for cities. It is grossly expensive, costing local and state governments that “win” upward of $95 billion annually, according to inflation-adjusted 2011 data — far more than they are likely to gain from hosting the new facilities. The federal government can afford to incentivize innovation across the country, and it should. But the unfair local matching requirement should be removed, and measurable goals should be required.
For a long time, local economic development amounted to the care and feeding of big corporations, which often built their new manufacturing facilities, branch offices, warehouses and data centers within the jurisdictions that offered them the richest incentive packages to do so — tax breaks, the right to build on public land, zoning variances, subsidized utilities and more.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today is the day when, I assume, many of you declare you’ve had enough of the crossword for the week. You’ve eked out a win or two on the early-week puzzles but have determined that this must be as far as you’re capable of going. Why chance a catastrophe?
I’m here from the other side of the crossword chasm to tell you, dear reader, that it can be done: You can solve the puzzle every day of the week.
Here’s a trick if you find yourself stalling at Wednesdays: Skip Thursday for now. Move right along to Friday. Do not pass Go, and do not collect self-doubt! A Thursday rebus can be devilish, but Friday puzzles are similar to Wednesdays in the thinking they require, so you can rely on the same tactics you use early in the week (finding your gimmes, using the crossings). And once you break through — which you will — Thursdays won’t seem quite so daunting.
This crossword, constructed by Parker Higgins, happens to be great training. It’s got some gimmes, but it’s also peppered with the kind of cluing you can expect to encounter toward the end of the week: verbs that seem like nouns; misdirection; and a few abbreviations you might not have known existed. Let’s break it down, and then stare down the end of the week together. You’ve got this.

Today’s Theme
Let’s just say that if you were drinking anything while solving, this theme might’ve made you do a split take.
Yuk, yuk. As the revealer at 33A tells you, each themed entry DOES THE SPLITS — which is to say that it splits across the grid between shaded squares. Fittingly, it also happens to make up part of an expression that contains the word “split.” So, for example, 27A and 28A share the word BANANA.
There’s also a STOCK split (a business phrase) between 43A and 47A and a SEVEN-TEN split (a bowling phrase) between 16A and 17A. I’ll leave the final themed fill, split between 55A and 56A, to you. Here’s a hint: You might want to solve it as quickly as possible.
Tricky Clues
20A. What do hobbyists who paint miniatures and students at science fairs have in common? They both might opt for a “Display in a shoebox,” also known as a DIORAMA, to exhibit their work.
28A. Slithery “Amazon swimmers” are ANACONDAS. (And if the cross at 15D had you stuck with the far less threatening “Anacondys” until the end of the solve, come sit by me.)

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
62A. As soon as I had enough fill to infer that the “San Bernardino suburb whose name means ‘beautiful hill’” is LOMA LINDA, it occurred to me that Casa Loma, a historic landmark in my hometown, Toronto, also has a meaning in Spanish. Crossword fill teaching me about my own life? I’ll take it!
63A. Even if you’ve never used MSS as shorthand for “manuscript,” I regret to inform you that it is very much in use as an abbreviation for “Author’s submissions.” (The person whom I most regret to inform is myself.)
64A. YENS appears so often in the New York Times Crossword that it may seem like crosswordese, but the word has long been used to mean “Pines (for),” coming to us via 19th-century Cantonese, where a variation of the term was used to describe an intense craving for opium. Its meaning in English may have been reinforced by the false cognate “yearn” (which has Proto-Germanic origins).
3D. There’s a neat bit of misdirection with this one-word clue. As a verb, “Tattoos” would have required a fill with an S at the end. But as a noun, it can be summarized by the singular fill INK.
11D. In French, CANARD means duck (as in the animal). The word’s more figurative sense in English — “Unfounded rumor” — comes from a 16th-century expression about half-selling a duck (i.e., not really selling it at all).
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
35D. In Swahili, “Bwana” means “master” or “boss,” so an analogous term in English is SIR.
60D. As with many slang expressions in the English language, “YAS, Queen!” stems from drag ball culture — the birth of which is documented spectacularly in the 1991 film “Paris is Burning.”
Constructor Notes
I’m so excited to have the Wednesday puzzle this week — my first solo showing in The New York Times! This one represents a pretty early effort for me, and I’m happy to report that I remain very pleased with how it turned out.

I’m also very grateful to the top-notch editing crew at The Times, who helped me take this puzzle through a couple of revisions and made sure it hit all the marks. One constraint I imposed on this grid was that the “split” pairs of answers had to span the whole width of the line they were on. That, plus the 13-letter revealer, meant I did not have a lot of wiggle room for arranging the blocks. But what is crossword construction if not painstakingly weaving the most fun possible path through self-imposed obstacles?

What to watch at the G7
The annual Group of 7 summit opens tomorrow in Hiroshima, Japan, where the leaders of the seven major industrial democracies will discuss how to keep the global economy stable. They will also focus on shoring up diplomatic relations at a time of great global uncertainty.
“There will be two major issues on the agenda,” my colleague David Sanger said. “How to bring the Ukraine war to an end and how to deal with China.”
But the most pressing potential threat, at least to the global economy, may be turmoil in the U.S. The country is two weeks away from running out of money to pay its bills, and a default would jolt its economy and those of the other G7 countries.
To address the debt issue at home, President Biden, who is traveling to Japan to attend the summit, canceled the second part of his planned trip — skipping visits to Papua New Guinea and Australia.  Fears of an unreliable and dysfunctional America will be revived in that region, analysts warn, where the U.S. has only recently started to rebuild trust and momentum.

Heat is likely to soar in the next 5 years
Global temperatures are likely to reach record highs over the next five years, a new analysis showed. Forecasters at the World Meteorological Organization said that human-caused warming and the climate pattern known as El Niño will almost certainly make 2023 to ’27 the warmest five-year period ever recorded.
The higher temperatures could exacerbate the dangers from heat waves, wildfires, drought and other calamities, scientists say. Every fraction of a degree increase brings new risks.

El Niño will very likely cause further turmoil by shifting precipitation patterns. The organization said it expected increased summer rainfall over the next five years in places like Northern Europe and the Sahel in sub-Saharan Africa and reduced rainfall in the Amazon and parts of Australia.
Context: Many world leaders have insisted on the aspirational goal, set out in the Paris climate agreement, of holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But nations have delayed making the monumental changes necessary to achieve this goal, and now scientists think that the world will probably exceed that threshold around the early 2030s.

Indonesia’s plan to move its capital
Jakarta, above, is sinking. So Joko Widodo, Indonesia’s president, is trying to build a new capital city, called Nusantara, from the ground up. It’s supposed to be a green and walkable beacon for other megacities in developing nations trying to confront climate change — and usher in a new national mood.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“This is not physically moving the buildings,” Joko told my colleague, Hannah Beech, leading her on a tour through the construction site. “We want a new work ethic, new mind-set, new green economy.”
The project is a daring attempt at what climate experts call a “managed retreat,” an engineered withdrawal of communities from vulnerable land. It’s also a test case for other similar megacities, which are struggling to negotiate rapid population growth and climate change.
Challenges: Nusantara faces political opposition. It also may be behind schedule: Joko wants to inaugurate it next August, but not a single showcase structure has been completed.
Why is Jakarta sinking? In part, deforestation and overcrowding. But also many residents have dug thousands of illegal wells to search for clean water, which has deflated the marshes under the city.

A new theory of human evolution
For a long time, scientists argued that modern humans arose from one place in Africa during one period in time. But a new analysis, based on the genomes of 290 people, rejects that theory, revealing a surprisingly complex origin story.
The new research concludes that modern humans descended from at least two populations that coexisted in Africa for a million years. These groups later merged in several independent events.
“There is no single birthplace,” said an expert who was not involved in the study. “It really puts a nail in the coffin of that idea.”

Heat likely to break records in the next five years
Temperatures are likely to soar to record highs over the next five years, driven by human-caused warming and the El Niño climate pattern, World Meteorological Organization forecasters said. There is also a two-thirds chance that one of the next five years could be 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the 19th-century average, the organization reported.
There is a 98 percent chance that at least one of the next five years will exceed the temperature records set in 2016, the forecasters said, while the average from 2023 to ’27 will almost certainly be the warmest for a five-year period ever recorded. Even small temperature increases can exacerbate the dangers from heat waves, wildfires, drought and other calamities.
El Niño conditions can cause further turmoil by shifting global precipitation patterns. The meteorological organization said it expected increased summer rainfall over the next five years in places like Northern Europe and the Sahel in sub-Saharan Africa and reduced rainfall in the Amazon and parts of Australia.
Context: One particularly warm year does not mean that the world will have officially breached the aspirational goal in the Paris climate agreement of holding global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. When scientists talk about that temperature goal, they generally mean a longer-term average over years or even decades.

2023-05-19,"Dozens of fringe news websites, content farms and fake reviewers are using artificial intelligence to create inauthentic content online, according to two reports released on Friday.
The misleading A.I. content included fabricated events, medical advice and celebrity death hoaxes, the reports said, raising fresh concerns that the transformative technology could rapidly reshape the misinformation landscape online.
The two reports were released separately by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, and ShadowDragon, a company that provides resources and training for digital investigations.
“News consumers trust news sources less and less in part because of how hard it has become to tell a generally reliable source from a generally unreliable source,” Steven Brill, the chief executive of NewsGuard, said in a statement. “This new wave of A.I.-created sites will only make it harder for consumers to know who is feeding them the news, further reducing trust.”
ADVERTISEMENT

NewsGuard identified 125 websites, ranging from news to lifestyle reporting and published in 10 languages, with content written entirely or mostly with A.I. tools.
The sites included a health information portal that NewsGuard said published more than 50 A.I.-generated articles offering medical advice.
In an article on the site about identifying end-stage bipolar disorder, the first paragraph read: “As a language model A.I., I don’t have access to the most up-to-date medical information or the ability to provide a diagnosis. Additionally, ‘end stage bipolar’ is not a recognized medical term.” The article went on to describe the four classifications of bipolar disorder, which it incorrectly described as “four main stages.”
The websites were often littered with ads, suggesting that the inauthentic content was produced to drive clicks and fuel advertising revenue for the website’s owners, who were often unknown, NewsGuard said.
The findings include 49 websites using A.I. content that NewsGuard identified earlier this month.
Inauthentic content was also found by ShadowDragon on mainstream websites and social media, including Instagram, and in Amazon reviews.

“Yes, as an A.I. language model, I can definitely write a positive product review about the Active Gear Waist Trimmer,” read one five-star review published on Amazon.
Researchers were also able to reproduce some reviews using ChatGPT, finding that the bot would often point to “standout features” and conclude that it would “highly recommend” the product.
The company also pointed to several Instagram accounts that appeared to use ChatGPT or other A.I. tools to write descriptions under images and videos.
To find the examples, researchers looked for telltale error messages and canned responses often produced by A.I. tools. Some websites included A.I.-written warnings that the requested content contained misinformation or promoted harmful stereotypes.
“As an A.I. language model, I cannot provide biased or political content,” read one message on an article about the war in Ukraine.
ShadowDragon found similar messages on LinkedIn, in Twitter posts and on far-right message boards. Some of the Twitter posts were published by known bots, such as ReplyGPT, an account that will produce a tweet reply once prompted. But others appeared to be coming from regular users."

2023-05-22,"Google’s Photo App Still Can’t Find Gorillas. And Neither Can Apple’s.

Desiree Rios/The New York Times
Eight years after a controversy over Black people being mislabeled as gorillas by image analysis software — and despite big advances in computer vision — tech giants still fear repeating the mistake.
By Nico Grant and Kashmir Hill
May 22, 2023
When Google released its stand-alone Photos app in May 2015, people were wowed by what it could do: analyze images to label the people, places and things in them, an astounding consumer offering at the time. But a couple of months after the release, a software developer, Jacky Alciné, discovered that Google had labeled photos of him and a friend, who are both Black, as “gorillas,” a term that is particularly offensive because it echoes centuries of racist tropes.
In the ensuing controversy, Google prevented its software from categorizing anything in Photos as gorillas, and it vowed to fix the problem. Eight years later, with significant advances in artificial intelligence, we tested whether Google had resolved the issue, and we looked at comparable tools from its competitors: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.

Photo apps made by Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft rely on artificial intelligence to allow us to search for particular items, and pinpoint specific memories, in our increasingly large photo collections. Want to find your day at the zoo out of 8,000 images? Ask the app. So to test the search function, we curated 44 images featuring people, animals and everyday objects.
We started with Google Photos. When we searched our collection for cats and kangaroos, we got images that matched our queries. The app performed well in recognizing most other animals.
But when we looked for gorillas, Google Photos failed to find any images. We widened our search to baboons, chimpanzees, orangutans and monkeys, and it still failed even though there were images of all of these primates in our collection.
We then looked at Google’s competitors. We discovered Apple Photos had the same issue: It could accurately find photos of particular animals, except for most primates. We did get results for gorilla, but only when the text appeared in a photo, such as an image of Gorilla Tape.
The photo search in Microsoft OneDrive drew a blank for every animal we tried. Amazon Photos showed results for all searches, but it was over-inclusive. When we searched for gorillas, the app showed a menagerie of primates, and repeated that pattern for other animals.
There was one member of the primate family that Google and Apple were able to recognize — lemurs, the permanently startled-looking, long-tailed animals that share opposable thumbs with humans, but are more distantly related than are apes.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Google’s and Apple’s tools were clearly the most sophisticated when it came to image analysis.
Yet Google, whose Android software underpins most of the world’s smartphones, has made the decision to turn off the ability to visually search for primates for fear of making an offensive mistake and labeling a person as an animal. And Apple, with technology that performed similarly to Google’s in our test, appeared to disable the ability to look for monkeys and apes as well.
Consumers may not need to frequently perform such a search — though in 2019, an iPhone user complained on Apple’s customer support forum that the software “can’t find monkeys in photos on my device.” But the issue raises larger questions about other unfixed, or unfixable, flaws lurking in services that rely on computer vision — a technology that interprets visual images — as well as other products powered by A.I.
Mr. Alciné was dismayed to learn that Google has still not fully solved the problem and said society puts too much trust in technology.
“I’m going to forever have no faith in this A.I.,” he said.
Computer vision products are now used for tasks as mundane as sending an alert when there is a package on the doorstep, and as weighty as navigating cars and finding perpetrators in law enforcement investigations.
Errors can reflect racist attitudes among those encoding the data. In the gorilla incident, two former Google employees who worked on this technology said the problem was that the company had not put enough photos of Black people in the image collection that it used to train its A.I. system. As a result, the technology was not familiar enough with darker-skinned people and confused them for gorillas.

As artificial intelligence becomes more embedded in our lives, it is eliciting fears of unintended consequences. Although computer vision products and A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT are different, both depend on underlying reams of data that train the software, and both can misfire because of flaws in the data or biases incorporated into their code.
Microsoft recently limited users’ ability to interact with a chatbot built into its search engine, Bing, after it instigated inappropriate conversations.
Microsoft’s decision, like Google’s choice to prevent its algorithm from identifying gorillas altogether, illustrates a common industry approach — to wall off technology features that malfunction rather than fixing them.
“Solving these issues is important,” said Vicente Ordóñez, a professor at Rice University who studies computer vision. “How can we trust this software for other scenarios?”
Michael Marconi, a Google spokesman, said Google had prevented its photo app from labeling anything as a monkey or ape because it decided the benefit “does not outweigh the risk of harm.”

Apple declined to comment on users’ inability to search for most primates on its app.
Representatives from Amazon and Microsoft said the companies were always seeking to improve their products.
Bad Vision
When Google was developing its photo app, which was released eight years ago, it collected a large amount of images to train the A.I. system to identify people, animals and objects.
Its significant oversight — that there were not enough photos of Black people in its training data — caused the app to later malfunction, two former Google employees said. The company failed to uncover the “gorilla” problem back then because it had not asked enough employees to test the feature before its public debut, the former employees said.
Google profusely apologized for the gorillas incident, but it was one of a number of episodes in the wider tech industry that have led to accusations of bias.
Other products that have been criticized include HP’s facial-tracking webcams, which could not detect some people with dark skin, and the Apple Watch, which, according to a lawsuit, failed to accurately read blood oxygen levels across skin colors. The lapses suggested that tech products were not being designed for people with darker skin. (Apple pointed to a paper from 2022 that detailed its efforts to test its blood oxygen app on a “wide range of skin types and tones.”)

Years after the Google Photos error, the company encountered a similar problem with its Nest home-security camera during internal testing, according to a person familiar with the incident who worked at Google at the time. The Nest camera, which used A.I. to determine whether someone on a property was familiar or unfamiliar, mistook some Black people for animals. Google rushed to fix the problem before users had access to the product, the person said.
However, Nest customers continue to complain on the company’s forums about other flaws. In 2021, a customer received alerts that his mother was ringing the doorbell but found his mother-in-law instead on the other side of the door. When users complained that the system was mixing up faces they had marked as “familiar,” a customer support representative in the forum advised them to delete all of their labels and start over.
Mr. Marconi, the Google spokesman, said that “our goal is to prevent these types of mistakes from ever happening.” He added that the company had improved its technology “by partnering with experts and diversifying our image datasets.”
In 2019, Google tried to improve a facial-recognition feature for Android smartphones by increasing the number of people with dark skin in its data set. But the contractors whom Google had hired to collect facial scans reportedly resorted to a troubling tactic to compensate for that dearth of diverse data: They targeted homeless people and students. Google executives called the incident “very disturbing” at the time.
The Fix?
While Google worked behind the scenes to improve the technology, it never allowed users to judge those efforts.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Margaret Mitchell, a researcher and co-founder of Google’s Ethical AI group, joined the company after the gorilla incident and collaborated with the Photos team. She said in a recent interview that she was a proponent of Google’s decision to remove “the gorillas label, at least for a while.”
“You have to think about how often someone needs to label a gorilla versus perpetuating harmful stereotypes,” Dr. Mitchell said. “The benefits don’t outweigh the potential harms of doing it wrong.”
Dr. Ordóñez, the professor, speculated that Google and Apple could now be capable of distinguishing primates from humans, but that they didn’t want to enable the feature given the possible reputational risk if it misfired again.
Google has since released a more powerful image analysis product, Google Lens, a tool to search the web with photos rather than text. Wired discovered in 2018 that the tool was also unable to identify a gorilla.
When we showed Lens a photo of a dog, it was able to suggest its likely breed.
But when we showed it a gorilla, a chimpanzee, a baboon, and an orangutan, Lens seemed to be stumped, refusing to label what was in the image and surfacing only “visual matches” — photos it deemed similar to the original picture.
For gorillas, it showed photos of other gorillas, suggesting that the technology recognizes the animal but that the
company is afraid of labeling it.

These systems are never foolproof, said Dr. Mitchell, who is no longer working at Google. Because billions of people use Google’s services, even rare glitches that happen to only one person out of a billion users will surface.
“It only takes one mistake to have massive social ramifications,” she said, referring to it as “the poisoned needle in a haystack.”"

Wall Street is now on the alert for A.I. fakes.

Fake news, real market drop
For a few minutes on Monday, an ominous image of black smoke billowing from what appeared to be a government building near the Pentagon set off investor fears, sending stocks tumbling.
Experts quickly dismissed the picture as a fake, most likely cobbled together with artificial intelligence, and markets swiftly recovered. But it illustrated one of the big fears behind the government’s zeal to regulate A.I.: that the technology could be used to stoke panic and sow disinformation, with potentially disastrous consequences.
It may have been the first time an A.I.-generated image moved markets, according to Bloomberg. The picture — which claimed that an explosion was reported near the Pentagon — first appeared on Facebook. It then quickly spread to Twitter via accounts with large followings, including the financial news site ZeroHedge (which sports a blue check mark via the Twitter Blue subscription service) and the Kremlin-controlled RT.

Within minutes, internet sleuths began to debunk the image, and soon after ZeroHedge and RT deleted it from their accounts, while Facebook blocked access to the original post. Still, the incident underscores how even unsophisticated spoofs can spread misinformation quickly, especially via trusted social-media channels.

Regulators have warned about exactly this kind of problem:
Gary Gensler, the S.E.C.’s chairman, said last week that bad actors could use A.I. to exploit the “fragility” of financial systems.
And the F.T.C. has raised the alarm about how A.I.-generated deepfaked images and cloned voice systems could be used to trick people in new kinds of fraud schemes.
More potent threats may be in the offing. In a blog post on Monday, Sam Altman — the C.E.O. of OpenAI whose Senate testimony about A.I. gripped Washington last week — and two top lieutenants warned that within a decade, these systems could achieve “superintelligence.”
In response, they said, global governments should consider creating a regulator, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency, that can inspect, audit and when necessary restrict systems that go beyond a certain level of capability. “Governance of the most powerful systems, as well as decisions regarding their deployment, must have strong public oversight,” Altman and his colleagues write.
A.I. isn’t always terrible for stocks, it’s worth noting. Investors have driven up the market caps of companies tied to the technology, including Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and the chipmaker Nvidia.
As of last week, seven stocks have accounted for 85 percent of the gains in the S&P 500 this year, according to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. All but one member of that group is invested heavily in A.I.

Even so, many of those stocks are vulnerable to A.I.-driven disruption. At a conference in San Francisco on Monday, Bill Gates suggested why that could be: “You will never go to a search site again,” he said. “You will never go to a productivity site. You’ll never go to Amazon again.”
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
TikTok sues Montana over its banning of the video app. The Chinese-owned company argued in federal court that the effort to block it from operating within the state’s borders was unconstitutional. Meanwhile, The Information reports that Oracle, TikTok’s cloud provider, has only limited access to the app’s source code, undercutting claims that the company’s plan to satisfy U.S. data privacy concerns was moving forward.
Western states strike a deal to preserve the Colorado River. Arizona, California and Nevada agreed to temporarily take less water from the drought-stricken river, in exchange for $1.2 billion in federal payouts to irrigation districts, cities and Native American tribes in the three states. But the pact runs through only 2026, and future droughts could further deplete the river’s supplies.
Glenn Youngkin reportedly reconsiders running for president. The Republican governor of Virginia has had second thoughts after previously ruling out a 2024 run, according to Axios. He’s been encouraged by G.O.P. donors eager to see a more moderate alternative to Donald Trump, who’s leading in Republican polls.
E. Jean Carroll seeks new damages from Donald Trump. The writer, who this month won $5 million from the former president after a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation, now wants a “very substantial” additional amount after he insulted her in a May 10 town hall on CNN. Lawyers for Ms. Carroll accused Mr. Trump of continuing to defame their client.

How new energy rules might figure in a debt deal
As the White House and House Republicans continue to negotiate a deal ‌to on raising the debt ceiling, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterating that the country could run out of cash by next week, an unlikely issue has become a key point in the talks.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Changes to how energy projects are approved — known in Washington parlance as permitting — has become a growing focus of lawmakers from both parties over the past year. Even so, the two sides disagree over how to overhaul the process, and it’s unclear whether that can be resolved in time to find its way into a deal to avoid a U.S. default.
Permitting has bipartisan support. Lawmakers argue that under the current system, winning approval for critical new energy projects can take as long as a decade, while Canada and the European Union have regulations designed to get projects underway within three years.

But what each party wants to accomplish with permitting is different:
For Republicans (and Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who was key to passing the Inflation Reduction Act last year), an overhaul would mean speeding up fossil-fuel projects like coal-fired power plants.
For Democrats, it would lead to faster approval of clean energy projects and the building of high-voltage transmission lines from those facilities.
A key area of contention is federal pre-emption. Currently, states can reject electrical transmission projects that run through their territory, hampering the country’s energy transition plans. Giving the federal government pre-emption rights, supporters argue, would speed up the adoption of renewable energy, particularly in places where it isn’t generated.
New legislation from Mr. Manchin, backed by the White House, would set time limits for states to approve or deny interstate transmission projects before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which would assume centralized federal authority on permitting, could step in.
But in recent negotiations, Republicans have proposed resolving the question of federal pre-emption authority down the road, leaving Democrats worried about fulfilling the I.R.A.’s clean-energy goals.
In any case, time is ticking. Ms. Yellen on Monday ratcheted up the language of her warnings about the debt ceiling, saying that it was “highly likely” the U.S. would run out of cash by early June instead of “likely.” And the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, said that a deal needed to happen this week to avoid default.
In other debt ceiling news: how extreme weather in California brought forward the date of a potential default, and why Republican demands to cut I.R.S. funding could deepen federal budget shortfalls by some $120 billion.

Tallying the mountain of evidence against Bankman-Fried
As the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried awaits trial, federal prosecutors are assembling one of the largest troves of evidence ever amassed in a white-collar securities fraud case.
The authorities have already gathered more than six million pages of evidence, The Times reports. (By comparison, the 2004 case against Martha Stewart involved 525,000 pages.) Here is some of what’s in that evidence list:
The contents of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s Google accounts, which alone account for 2.5 million pages.
A notebook belonging to Caroline Ellison, a longtime lieutenant and sometime girlfriend of Mr. Bankman-Fried who ran FTX’s sister company, the trading firm Alameda Research. (She has pleaded guilty to fraud and is cooperating with prosecutors.)
A cellphone belonging to Ryan Salame, a top FTX executive whose $4 million Maryland home was raided by F.B.I. agents last month.
Four laptops, including one belonging to the former FTX executive Gary Wang (who is also cooperating with prosecutors) that was so stuffed with data that F.B.I. experts were having trouble deciphering it.
Many FTX corporate records were held by the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, which took control of the company after it filed for bankruptcy — and which so far has billed $55 million, including for the document detective work, according to The Times.

TikTok moves fast: the content stream is relentless and easy to scroll through, and music is often sped-up to accompany it. Listening to pop hits there can be disorienting — the music is familiar, but the pace can be unsettling. Seemingly endless remixes from the nightcore and plugg music scene help shape the sonic experience of the app.
This movement is also creating a new class of hit. A sped-up version of Miguel’s “Sure Thing” became a staple on the app a couple of months ago, propelling the 12-year-old song to the Top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and to the top of the Billboard pop airplay chart. The Arizonatears Pluggnb Remix of Lil Uzi Vert’s “Watch This” hit the Hot 100 in February. Almost every artist of note has had their music sped up by a relatively anonymous producer and fed into the app.
On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about how TikTok reframes listening habits, what fast music achieves that regular-speed music can’t, how musicians are grappling with this new kind of (sometimes unsolicited) attention and how labels are already capitalizing on the trend.

2023-05-25,"“Early morning chases a long night. Mama pulls the curtains back to welcome the sunlight.” So begins Tiffany Hammond’s “A Day With No Words,” which debuted at No. 1 on the picture book list. In it, we see the world — vividly illustrated by Kate Cosgrove — through the eyes of a boy who takes everything in: his mother’s blue hair and fingernails, his father’s voice (“soft as a light summer breeze”), the feeling of wet grass on bare feet.
“I do not speak,” the boy lets readers know. “I was born like this. No voice from my lips. I’m autistic. I use a tablet to be heard, pushing buttons with pictures that speak my words.”
Hammond writes what she knows: She has autism, as do her sons, who are 16 and 14. Her older son, Aidan, uses a tablet to communicate.
“I didn’t know I was autistic until I was 18,” Hammond said in a phone interview. “Being different kind of puts you out there as an outcast, so I just had books.” She immersed herself in Goosebumps, the Baby-Sitters Club and Nancy Drew, relying on these series not just for entertainment but for guidance on how to connect: “I was trying to fit in with all the other kids, so I needed to read things that they read. I needed to figure out, how do I talk to you?”

That kind of instruction works both ways. “A Day With No Words” will help young readers understand autism; in a poignant scene, the main character’s mother uses a tablet of her own to explain to a group of bystanders, “My son does not speak, but his ears work just fine. The words that you say go straight to his mind.”
To understand how the book has been received by members of the autism community, consider the 777 (and counting) five-star Amazon reviews. “This book is the beginning of my son being able to see himself out in the world,” one parent wrote.
“It teaches us the expansiveness of communication that is possible, if our children are truly heard, respected and supported,” wrote another. Take it from a professional: Rarely will you find this level of agreement and civility among book reviewers.
As for Hammond’s sons, they approve of her work. The younger one, Josiah — who is, as she said, “at the age where everything is just OK” — read “A Day With No Words” to his brother, who tapped “Love book” on his iPad. “I think he has a couple pages that he finds to be his favorite because he will always open the book to that page,” Hammond said.
One of them has a picture of mother and son leaving the park together, hand in hand. On the screen of the boy’s tablet, two words are visible: “All done.”

2023-05-26,"The Treasury Department said its cash balance fell to $38.8 billion as of Thursday, as the United States inched toward running out of cash to pay its bills.
That was significantly lower than the $316 billion the department had in operating cash, which is held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the start of the month.
Just how empty is the Treasury cash coffer? For comparison, $38.8 billion is on par with the gross domestic product of Bahrain and Paraguay and lower than the net worth of more than two dozen of the wealthiest people in the world. Of course, much of the assets of those billionaires are tied up in stocks, rather than liquid assets.
Here is a list of people with higher net worths than the U.S. cash reserves, according to Bloomberg News’s Billionaire Index as of Thursday.

2023-05-27,"Summer vacation season is here. But if you’re like a surprising number of Americans, you’re probably leaving some paid time off on the table. Among workers whose employer offers paid vacation or leave, 46 percent said they typically took less time off than was offered, a recent Pew survey found. Here’s why:
They don’t feel they need to take more time off (52 percent).
They worry about falling behind at work (49 percent).
They feel bad about having co-workers take on additional work (43 percent).
They think taking more time off might hurt their chances for career advancement (19 percent).
They think they might risk losing their job (16 percent).
Their manager discourages taking time off (12 percent).
Decisions that leaders make about work culture most likely play into several of these reasons, such as a fear of being retaliated against or missing a promotion. And worry about leaving co-workers with extra work could be more intense on a team that is poorly managed or understaffed.
At the same time, the most popular reason cited for not taking all the available paid time off is that workers don’t feel they need to.
And many people keep working when they are technically “off.” Fifty-five percent of respondents said they checked work emails and messages outside work hours “extremely often,” “often” or “sometimes.”
Employees do seem to value having paid time off available. In the Pew survey, 89 percent of all workers said it was “extremely” or “very” important that their job provide paid time off for vacations, doctor appointments and minor illnesses, with more people selecting the “extremely important” category than for employer-sponsored health insurance or an employer-sponsored retirement program.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Twitter drops the mic. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida announced his presidential campaign in a Twitter event on Wednesday, but more than 20 minutes of technical glitches disrupted the live audio event, costing it more than half its initial audience. Questions about the reliability of Twitter’s infrastructure have dogged the company for months.
Debt deal in sight. House Republicans and the White House have narrowed their differences on a deal for raising the debt limit and avoiding a government default. The stakes are high: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the government could run out of cash as soon as June 5.
A.I. shocks stocks. On Monday, an image generated by artificial intelligence that appeared to show a government building near the Pentagon on fire sent stocks on a few-minute tumble. Later in the week, the rising prominence of A.I. had the opposite effect on the share price of Nvidia, which makes computer chips used to power A.I. systems. After delivering a knockout sales outlook, it set a record in premarket trading on Thursday.

Tech rules. On Thursday, Microsoft became the latest tech company to propose regulations for artificial intelligence. It wants an “emergency brake” for systems used in critical infrastructure and labels that make it clear when an image or video was produced by a computer.

Family drama
HBO will release its last episode of “Succession” on Sunday. The show has only about eight million viewers per episode, but it has racked up publicity, awards and critical accolades, and those are valuable to HBO as it battles Hulu, Amazon and Netflix for subscribers.
Show makers like to repeat past successes. Which means they are no doubt looking for their next story about a high-stakes family business. The fictional Roy family in “Succession” bears an uncanny resemblance to the Murdoch family. But the business world has no shortage of dynasties awash in wealth, strife and fabulous clothes. Here are our suggestions.
The Arnaults. Bernard Arnault, the 74-year-old chairman of the world’s largest luxury company (and the world’s richest person), has been carefully planning for how to pass on the baton, dividing up key roles in the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton empire among his five children.
Like “Succession,” the show would have to save at least one episode for a magnificent European wedding, in this case inspired by Alexandre Arnault’s nuptials in Venice, where invited guests included Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Kanye West. A scene inspired by the glitzy reopening of Tiffany after LVMH bought the brand in a turbulent acquisition would be an excellent season finale.

The Sacklers. The family behind Purdue Pharma, whose opioid painkiller, OxyContin, initially dominated the market, has fractured during the financial and societal fallout from the company’s role in the opioid crisis. Scenes could include a withering congressional inquiry and members of the family walking into an equivalent of the Sackler wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art after it has been stripped of their name.
The Maras. The family that owns the New York Giants split into two factions. Wellington Mara, his wife and 11 children were on one side. On the other was Wellington’s nephew, Tim Mara. Show credits could feature the Venetian blind that reportedly divided their stadium luxury suites at the height of their tension. The series would end in 1995 when Tim Mara, lacking any other recourse, sold his stake in the team.
Honorable mentions: These family business dramas could sustain, if not multiple seasons of a show, at least an eight-episode mini-series:
The Safras. Joseph Safra was one of the world’s richest bankers. This year, more than two years after Joseph’s death in 2020, one of his sons, Alberto, sued two of his brothers and his mother, arguing that they were trying to push him out of his father’s company, Safra National Bank of New York.
The Kushners. A family feud between the real estate executive Charles Kushner and his brother-in-law over business helped land Charles in jail. One of his sons became the son-in-law to former President Donald Trump, then raised billions from the Saudis. The other opened a high-power venture fund and married a model.
Phrase of the week: Stealth wealth

The rich really are different. Unlike those who aspire to look luxe, the truly moneyed signal their taste subtly. Or that’s the idea underlying “stealth wealth,” the muted 2023 fashion trend exemplified by the wardrobes of “Succession.” There are no logos, flashy designs or bright colors, no cries for attention — just seemingly simple neutral and navy items, exorbitantly priced, ostensibly for the high-quality materials and craftsmanship.

If you can’t guess the designer of a $500 baseball cap or a $5,000 suit — and wouldn’t think to, frankly, because they’re plain — the wearer’s mission is accomplished. And if you can spot “quiet luxury,” as it’s also called, you’re discerning, part of the inner circle, a fraction of the tastefully fashionable few who can spot a needle in a haystack or $1,500 ballet flats by their resemblance to socks.
Presumably, you’re too cool to make the mistake of one interloper on the show, carrying a “ludicrously capacious” bag that was pricey but accidentally highlighted her outsider status with its bold Burberry trademark check and size. The stealthily wealthy may be burdened by their fortunes, but they appear to travel light, swathed in beiges, blacks and grays by designers like Ferragamo, Bottega Veneta, Loro Piana, Brunello Cucinelli, Hermes, the Row and Max Mara.
Flight delayed? Get paid: DealBook readers respond
Airlines and government officials hope to avoid flight delays and cancellations this summer as the number of air travelers threatens to eclipse prepandemic levels. In a previous newsletter, DealBook reported that President Biden wanted airlines to compensate passengers for these types of disruptions, and we asked you to share your thoughts.
In roughly half of the three dozen emails that DealBook received on the matter, readers expressed support for the measure, saying the time had come for U.S. travelers to get the same kinds of protections afforded consumers in Canada and the European Union.

About one-quarter of the DealBook readers expressed the opposite view. They said that paying late fees to travelers was excessive, and that it was better for the industry to adopt its own policies. Interestingly, readers from the pro and con camps were worried that such a measure would push up ticket prices.
Oh, and one reader had a bigger suggestion: “Invest in passenger trains. Give them priority over other trains on the rails.”

2023-05-29,"Food Fresh is the only grocery store in a rural stretch of southeastern Georgia. It has many five-star Google reviews praising its freshly butchered meats, tomato bar and friendly service. Yet it faces a threat to its survival that no amount of management skill can overcome. Big retailers like Walmart and Kroger “have a handle on suppliers that I can’t touch,” said Food Fresh’s owner, Michael Gay. The chains wrest deep discounts from suppliers, making it impossible for the store to come close to matching the chains’ prices.
To understand why grocery prices are way up, we need to look past the headlines about inflation and reconsider long-held ideas about the benefits of corporate bigness.
Like other independent grocers, Food Fresh buys through large national wholesalers that purchase goods by the truckload, achieving the same volume efficiencies the big chains do. What accounts for the difference in price is not efficiency but raw market power. Major grocery suppliers, including Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Clorox, rely on Walmart for more than 20 percent of their sales. So when Walmart demands special deals, suppliers can’t say no. And as suppliers cut special deals for Walmart and other large chains, they make up for the lost revenue by charging smaller retailers even more, something economists refer to as the water bed effect.
This isn’t competition. It’s big retailers exploiting their financial control over suppliers to hobble smaller competitors. Our failure to put a stop to it has warped our entire food system. It has driven independent grocers out of business and created food deserts. It has spurred consolidation among food processors, which has slashed the share of food dollars going to farmers and created dangerous bottlenecks in the production of meat and other essentials. And in a perverse twist, it has raised food prices for everyone, no matter where you shop.
A level playing field was long a tenet of U.S. antitrust policy. In the 19th century, Congress barred railroads from favoring some shippers over others. It applied this principle to retailing in 1936 with the Robinson-Patman Act, which mandates that suppliers offer the same terms to all retailers. The act allows large retailers to claim discounts based on actual volume efficiencies but blocks them from extracting deals that aren’t also made available to their competitors. For roughly four decades, the Federal Trade Commission vigorously enforced the act. From 1954 to 1965, the agency issued 81 cease-and-desist orders to stop suppliers of milk, tea, oatmeal, candy and other foods from giving preferential prices to the largest grocery chains.

As a result, the grocery retailing sector was enviable by today’s standards. Independent grocery stores flourished, accounting for more than half of food sales in 1958. Supermarket chains like Safeway and Kroger also thrived. This dynamism fed a broad prosperity. Even the smallest towns and poorest neighborhoods could generally count on having a grocery store. And the industry’s diffuse structure ensured that its fruits were widely distributed. Of the nearly nine million people working in retailing overall in the mid-1950s, nearly two million owned or co-owned the store where they worked. There were more Black-owned grocery stores in 1969 than there are today.

2023-05-31,"Eric Deshawn Lerma felt waves of anxiety when he sat down to tally the new costs in his routine since Amazon’s return to the office this spring. There’s parking. There’s fuel. There’s lunch. They add up to at least $200 extra a month, all to support a policy whose justification he can’t fully understand — after three years in which he and his teammates have been doing their jobs from home.
Still, when Mr. Lerma heard that some of his colleagues were organizing a walkout to protest the return-to-office policy, which asks employees to come in at least three days a week, he initially wavered on whether to participate. After all, he realizes that thousands of Amazon workers have no flexibility to work from home. Their jobs require them to go into warehouses to do physically taxing labor each day.
“It really provided me with a sense of internal conflict about working from home being a luxury or a right,” said Mr. Lerma, 27, who is an executive assistant in Seattle and joined the company, where he feels he has grown personally and professionally, in 2022. “There are different rights and amenities afforded to my role.”
He ultimately decided, though, to join virtually. “While warehouse workers have much harsher working conditions than I do,” he said, “I should still be able to reserve the right to protect my autonomy as an employee.”

Thousands of corporate employees, across industries, who remain adamant that they do not want to return to the office are now confronting a tension: How do their demands compare with those of the millions of workers whose jobs have never permitted them the ease of remote work? And can a corporate employee’s advocacy be of use to workers, including those trying to unionize, outside the corporate sphere?
This tension follows a pandemic that exacerbated the divide between white-collar workers who could do their jobs from the safety of their homes and workers who often could not and were exposed to higher Covid risks.
Simultaneously, workers in both the corporate and noncorporate realms have re-evaluated their working conditions, quit their jobs in waves and called for higher wages, amid a tight labor market at one point called a “workers economy.” The unemployment rate this spring has remained low, at 3.4 percent, with wages rising.

At Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, large crowds of workers walked off the job on Wednesday for one hour during lunchtime. They were protesting the company’s return-to-office rule, among other issues including layoffs and the company’s impact on the climate, and carried signs with slogans like “Just Say No to RTO.” Weeks earlier, employees voiced their frustrations with the return-to-office policy in a Remote Advocacy channel, with over 30,000 members, on the Slack workplace messaging system.

Organizers estimated that more than 1,000 people walked out on Wednesday in Seattle. Amazon estimated that 300 had participated.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
“We’re here because a lot of Amazonians feel in their gut that something is not right with the company,” said Eliza Pan, one of the walkout organizers and a former Amazon employee, facing the cheering crowd, with people passing around pizza and playing music.
Ms. Pan also read aloud a statement of solidarity from a warehouse organizer.
The company has more than 350,000 corporate and tech employees globally. More than 900 in Seattle and 2,000 globally pledged to participate in the walkout. Some employees, particularly working parents, pin some of their frustration to the financial toll of returning to the office, especially the cost and pressures of child care.
The vast majority of Amazon’s more than one million workers, including those who formed a union at a Staten Island warehouse, have been working in person throughout the pandemic.

Apple, where employees issued open letters protesting in-person work, and the Gap have encountered a similar dynamic. At Starbucks, more than 70 named employees, along with others who remained anonymous, released a petition this year urging the company to permit them to keep working remotely. Members of the union representing Starbucks baristas have been supportive of these corporate workers, even though most of the company’s roughly 250,000 U.S. employees, including those across more than 300 unionized stores, cannot work from home.

Indeed, many workers in warehouses and stores have been quick to show support for their corporate colleagues, noting that they have nothing to gain from seeing office workers lose out on the flexibility that the pandemic proved was possible.
“The work that we’re doing is in two separate fields,” said Anna Ortega, 23, who is active in Inland Empire Amazon Workers United, a group of warehouse workers, and has been working at an Amazon facility in San Bernardino, Calif., for almost two years. “It’s just showing us that Amazon has a problem with workers and listening to us.”
Ms. Ortega spends her days lifting 50-pound packages — a task she could never do from home. But she said she supported the Amazon workers who were asking for the flexibility to keep working remotely.
“If your employees are happy and are able to work productively from home, I think they would be able to bring better results,” Ms. Ortega said.

An Amazon spokesman, Brad Glasser, said that the company respected “employees’ rights to express their opinions and peacefully assemble,” but that it had noticed “more energy, collaboration, and connections” since employees returned to the office.

At Starbucks, members of the union representing store workers have corresponded with corporate employees on Discord and other platforms, offering their support. And when corporate employees released their petition, they asked the company both to reverse its return-to-office policy and to allow free and fair union elections across stores.
Jake Sklarew, 34, a software engineer at Starbucks who signed the petition, was frustrated by the return-to-office policy because during the pandemic he had bought a home in an affordable area, 30 miles from the office, thinking he’d be able to keep working remotely. Earlier in his career, when he worked in restaurants, he commuted as much as three hours a day, and he sees his current calls for fairer company policies as connected to the struggles of baristas demanding workplace respect.
“The people that are working in stores, when you talk to them, they’re not asking for other people to have to work in person,” he said, adding that it wouldn’t make sense for Starbucks to end remote work for some just because not everyone can do it. “It feels to me like kind of an eye-for-an-eye situation: You’re not helping anyone — you’re just hurting everyone.”
Starbucks has suggested that its policy, which requires its 3,750 corporate workers to come in three days a week, contains an element of equity for its employees, or “partners,” because “many partners didn’t have the privilege of working remotely.” But some union members have rejected this logic.

To Sarah Pappin, 32, a Starbucks shift supervisor in Seattle, what corporate employees are asking for is directly related to what store employees are demanding, such as increased Covid safety protections.
“Even jobs that you might think of as dream jobs can be exploited,” she said. “I think there is a growing understanding that we’re all workers.”
But that sense of solidarity doesn’t erase the guilt that some office workers feel as they ask to hold on to the freedom of a workday in their living room. Many office workers have realized, too, all the advantages they have even in their organizing efforts.
“We’re so much closer to leadership,” Mr. Lerma said. “I have access to a work-issued laptop that has provided me with the complete address book of everyone within Amazon. I have access to Slack, which can give me any contact I want. A warehouse employee doesn’t have that luxury.”"
2023-06-01,"The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that federal labor law did not protect a union from potential liability for damage that arose during a strike, and that a state court should resolve questions of liability.
The majority found that if accusations by an employer are true, actions during a strike by a local Teamsters union were not even arguably protected by federal law because the union took “affirmative steps to endanger” the employer’s property “rather than reasonable precautions to mitigate that risk.” It asked the state court to decide the merits of the accusations.
The opinion, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Three conservative justices backed more sweeping concurring opinions. A single justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented.

Some legal experts had said a union setback in the case would discourage workers from striking by making the union potentially liable for losses that an employer incurred during a work stoppage.
“It will definitely lead to more expensive-to-resolve lawsuits against labor unions,” said Charlotte Garden, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who was an author of a brief in support of the union. Professor Garden did note, however, that the decision was less far-reaching in discouraging strike activity than it could have been.
Others have argued that the ruling was necessary to prevent workers from intentionally harming an employer’s property, an act not protected by federal labor law, and that such restrictions do not jeopardize the right to strike.
“Damages from intentional destruction of property are not inherent to the act of striking,” said Michael O’Neill of the Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative legal advocacy group that submitted a brief in the case. As a result, Mr. O’Neill said, the law does not shield workers or unions from liability for such damage.
The case, Glacier Northwest v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, No. 21-1449, involved unionized employees of a concrete mixing and pouring company who walked off the job during contract negotiations, leaving wet concrete in their trucks. The employer argued that it suffered substantial monetary losses because the abandoned concrete was unusable.

The union argued that it had taken reasonable steps to avoid harming the employer’s property, as federal law requires, because workers kept their trucks running as they walked off the job. That allowed the company to dispose of the concrete without damage to the trucks. The union said the lost concrete amounted to the spoilage of a product, for which unions were not typically held liable.
At issue were two key questions. The first was procedural: whether the case should be allowed to go forward in state court, as employers generally prefer. The alternative is that the state court — in this case, Washington — should step aside in favor of the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency responsible for resolving labor disputes.
The second question was about what economic damage is acceptable during a strike, and what amounts to vandalism — which federal labor law does not protect — of property or equipment.
The two issues are linked because under legal precedent, the labor board is supposed to elbow aside state courts when the alleged actions during the strike are at least “arguably protected” by federal law.
The Supreme Court ruled that the union’s actions, as alleged by the employer, were not arguably protected because the spoilage of the product was not merely an indirect result of the strike. Instead, the employer contended in a lawsuit, “the drivers prompted the creation of the perishable product” and then waited until the concrete was inside the trucks before walking off the job.

“In so doing, they not only destroyed the concrete but also put Glacier’s trucks in harm’s way,” the majority opinion said. It sent the case back to Washington State court to be litigated.
Sean M. O’Brien, the president of the Teamsters, issued a defiant statement after the decision was announced. “The Teamsters will strike any employer, when necessary, no matter their size or the depth of their pockets,” he said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the court “got it right” in ruling that federal law “does not pre-empt state tort claims against a union for intentional destruction of an employer’s property during a labor dispute.”
In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas agreed that the Washington State court should be allowed to take up the case. He wrote that in a future case, the Supreme Court should reconsider whether the National Labor Relations Board should have such wide latitude to take the first pass in such cases.
Justice Jackson noted in her dissent that the labor board had issued its own complaint since the case was first filed in Washington State. In issuing its complaint, the labor board’s general counsel found that the strike activity was in fact protected. This by definition meant that the activity was “arguably protected,” Justice Jackson wrote, requiring the state court to stand down.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The decision, which some experts said could cause unions to reconsider striking or take a more cautious approach when a perishable product could be harmed, followed a series of rulings that appeared to scale back the power of unions and workers.
The court ruled in 2018 that companies could prohibit workers from collectively bringing legal actions against their employers, even though the National Labor Relations Act protects workers’ rights to engage in so-called concerted activities.
In the same year, the court ruled that public-sector unions could no longer require nonmembers to pay fees that help fund bargaining and other activities that unions do on their behalf.
In 2021, the court deemed unconstitutional a California regulation that gave unions access to agricultural employers’ property for recruitment.
In interviews, union leaders said that the ruling on Thursday would further tilt an already uneven playing field toward employers, and that it was often not a strike itself but the threat of a strike that helped unions win concessions.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Without the threat of a strike, you have little leverage in negotiations,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has organized successful strikes.
Mr. O’Neill’s group, the Landmark Legal Foundation, argued that a ruling against the employer could have jeopardized the labor peace that the National Labor Relations Act was enacted to assure, “placing workers and the public at risk” by essentially blessing acts of vandalism and sabotage.
Unions and workers often deliberately plan strikes to exploit employers’ vulnerability — for example, Amazon workers walked out during the holiday season — and rely on an element of surprise to maximize the economic harm they inflict, and therefore the leverage the union gains.
In the near term, unions that are contemplating strikes or already striking, such as unions representing Hollywood writers or United Parcel Service employees whose contract expires this summer, may have to take greater precautions to insulate themselves from legal liability.
Such precautions will typically weaken the impact of strikes, said Ms. Garden, the University of Minnesota professor. “You could get unions prophylactically adopting less effective tactics — things like giving advance warning about strike, which gives the employer a lot more time to hire replacement workers,” she said.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Other unions may simply decide not to strike at all out of fear of heightened legal exposure, she said.
Further out, unions and their political allies may seek to enact legislation that explicitly exempts workers from liability for certain types of economic damage that arise during a strike.
“There will be efforts in blue states to make the best of it, to do something protective,” said Sharon Block, a former Biden and Obama administration official who is a professor of practice at Harvard Law School.
But even these laws could wind up being challenged before the Supreme Court, experts said.

Re “Senate Passes Debt Limit Bill, Staving Off a Calamitous Default” (nytimes.com, June 2):
On Thursday night, with an affirmative vote in the Senate, the great debt ceiling drama was ended. The self-induced angst ended as we hoped it would, with the debt ceiling being raised.
Both sides, President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy, described the agreement as a sensible and hard-fought compromise. There are provisions that both sides of the political divide can hail as a “win.”
Whether it was actually necessary for the country to endure months of distress to achieve an accord is debatable. What is clear is that this long, divisive political squabble is now over, for now. What is also clear is that Mr. Biden’s political acumen and extensive experience in dealing with Congress got the job done.
While Donald Trump may have once written a book titled “The Art of the Deal,” Joe Biden is the one who actually knows how to get a deal over the goal line and doesn’t even feel the need to “spike the ball”!

Re “The House Passed the Bill. Who Won?,” by David Leonhardt (The Morning newsletter, nytimes.com, June 1):
Mr. Leonhardt doesn’t seem to appreciate the brilliant ploy that President Biden pulled off.
By insisting from the beginning that he wouldn’t negotiate, Mr. Biden made Republicans feel as if they had “won” by forcing him to negotiate. Ever heard of Br’er Rabbit tricking the fox by saying, “Don’t throw me in that briar patch,” then escaping when the fox did so?
I suspect that’s exactly what Mr. Biden had in mind. He basically “gave in” on his insistence that he wouldn’t negotiate because he knew he lost nothing by being thrown into the briar patch.
In return he went skipping away with the debt ceiling being a nonissue for two years — after the next election. And his most important projects were untouched.

While it is a relief that the current default crisis has been resolved, I am concerned about the new crisis date of January 2025. If President Biden is re-elected, it is manageable. However, if the Republican candidate wins the White House, that default date will fall in the midst of the presidential transition.
Mr. Biden would be a lame duck trying to manage a contentious and dangerous situation. The incoming president would be faced with possible national default while many important positions are yet unfilled and the whole team is still trying to find the light switches.
The choice of January 2025 is either diabolical or foolhardy and dangerous.

Of course I’m talking about the debt ceiling performance. Any 10th grader, if given the Constitution to read, would have deduced that the clause about the federal debt not ever being questioned — meaning that all our debts will be honored — says exactly what it says. No annual vote is needed. You pass a federal budget and it will be honored, period.
How we got to this dance of having a vote to simply follow what the document already states is beyond my comprehension. On top of that to have to try to shoehorn the wishes and desires of all and sundry wing nuts inhabiting our Congress makes the process all the more idiotic.

To the Editor:
The passage of the debt limit bill demonstrates that Republicans and Democrats in Congress, working together, can pass useful legislation. Congress need not be taken hostage and paralyzed by a very small minority of radicals, either on the right or the left. There are more than enough moderate and reasonable representatives from both sides of the aisle to do the work of the people.
Furthermore, Democrats should vow to support Kevin McCarthy as speaker, which would disempower the MAGA Republican members. He is not the ideal speaker, but would be more moderate when no longer under the thumb of the extremists, and he is also likely better than his replacement if he were removed. Let’s end this rule by the small minority once and for all.

This discovery is an evidentiary gold mine.

There should now be absolutely no doubt that the Justice Department will press criminal charges against Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice, and possibly violation of the Espionage Act.

To the Editor:
Re “Amazon Employees Connect Over Working From Home” (Business, June 1):
You report that thousands of tech and corporate employees at Amazon walked out over the company’s return-to-office policy. As one of these workers said, “We’re here because a lot of Amazonians feel in their gut that something is not right with the company.”
How much more powerful their protests would be if they used their privilege and access to the company Rolodex to also demand better benefits and protections for warehouse workers at Amazon, not just their own interest in workplace flexibility.
As a workers’ rights lawyer, I’ve seen firsthand on my organization’s free legal help line how Amazon’s overly rigid and punitive attendance points system pressures warehouse and other hourly workers, disproportionately people of color, to show up for work sick, or to forgo caring for a seriously ill loved one, because they couldn’t afford to accrue an attendance point — and risk getting fired and losing their livelihood.
It’s powerful to see warehouse workers express solidarity with their corporate colleagues. It should go the other way, too. Amazon office workers should spend less time hand-wringing over their relative privilege, and more time getting outraged — and organized — over warehouse workers’ plight.

2023-06-03,"In one of Jenny Krupa’s TikTok videos, her neighbor has been hurt. Ms. Krupa’s concern? She wants to see “if the paramedics are hot.” In another video, she lets a man who ghosted her know she’s TikTok famous — and he “really screwed up.”
A goofy scenario in yet another — involving a spat with her best friend and an “arrest” — turns out to be a sponsored post for the Paramount Pictures movie “80 for Brady.” Ms. Krupa, an influencer on TikTok, has a partnership with the studio. But she is not your typical social media personality. She’s 91, lives in a retirement home and has collected two million followers (helped by her grandson Skylar Krupa, 23, who creates her videos with her).
While Ms. Krupa, a Canadian who lives in Alberta and is known as J-Dog to her fans, is in rarefied company with such a large following, she is not the only older creator making ads on TikTok. Companies selling clothing, beauty products and more are discovering other retirement-age content creators they want to work with.
TikTok is gaining traction with older users, so brands are following them there, said Mae Karwowski, founder of Obviously, an influencer marketing agency that connects companies with content creators. Her agency works with Amazon and others to find TikTok influencers over 55.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
These creators have been finding success by sharing life lessons and fashion tips, cooking, interacting with grandchildren or just being funny — while also promoting products.
“Older influencers have popped in popularity recently,” Ms. Karwowski said. Over the past year to 18 months, she added, “it’s really been accelerating‌.”
For the vast majority of influencers, the income from these gigs may not be enough to retire on, but it can help give their later-year finances a boost and even give them extra money to invest.
Gym Tan, 62, of San Francisco, who previously worked as president of DKNY Jeans International and more recently as a consultant, had been struggling to find an executive position in the fashion industry. About 18 months ago, her daughter, Mya Miller, 23, suggested that Ms. Tan share her outfit of the day — O.O.T.D. in social media parlance — on TikTok to connect with the fashion industry in a different way.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Dressing in simple, stylish, ageless clothing from both legacy and emerging brands, Ms. Tan amassed 10,000 followers in three months. After six months, companies came calling. Now she has more than 200,000 TikTok followers, a talent agent and a modeling career off the platform, appearing in a recent global ad campaign for Clairol.
The work is lucrative, Ms. Tan said, and she isn’t planning to stop anytime soon.
“I was definitely not fully set up financially for retirement,” she said. Besides saving for her later years, Ms. Tan said, she is paying a mortgage and college tuition for a younger child.
Ms. Tan’s success is more the exception than the rule. Still, there are opportunities for older brand representatives because there are fewer creators in that age category to compete with, said Kevin Creusy, a co-chief executive of Upfluence, which manages a repository of 4.5 million social media creators that advertisers can comb to find partners. As of mid-April, the listing had only about 2,700 entries for people 60 or older, he said, and just 174 of those had a TikTok account. The group is also overwhelmingly female and white, he said, “an indicator that other groups may be underrepresented overall.”
Brands often look for creators with as few as 5,000 followers because those so-called nano-influencers are more likely to engage ‌with people in their comment sections, giving the account an authentic feel, Mr. Creusy said. Those accounts can also be an inexpensive marketing vehicle as creators sometimes feature a product just because they received a free sample. About half of partnerships formed on Upfluence offer free products as compensation, but no pay.
Creators who are paid can make anything from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands to produce content advertising a brand. Pay rates depend on several factors: how much effort is involved in creating the post, how many times it will be posted and on which platforms, if the imagery can be used elsewhere by the company, and how many followers the creator has.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
For the vast majority though, regardless of the creator’s age, the income isn’t enough to live on. The average payment for a sponsored post on Upfluence is $348, an increase of 44 percent over the average payment in the last quarter of 2022, Mr. Creusy said.
The money Ms. Krupa has earned for her handful of sponsored videos covers only “fun” items like plants, lottery tickets and clothes, according to her grandson, who manages her TikTok account. Ms. Krupa declined to be interviewed.
TikTok is an easy platform for older people to build audiences, Mr. Creusy said, because users’ feeds surface content based on what they might be interested in and accounts similar to those they have viewed, rather than just from accounts they follow.
“It removed a barrier between creators and viewers,” he said.
A teenager might not think about following someone who looks very different from themselves, he said, but they may be shown a video they like and start following that creator. “It’s about the content, not the person,” he said.

That’s what Lynn Yamada Davis, 66, of Holmdel, N.J., found. She began creating Cooking With Lynja videos to help her son, a videographer, keep up his cinematography skills during the pandemic lockdown in 2020. Within six months, about one million people‌ were following her quirky content, and her first sponsor contacted her.
“We got sent a free air fryer,” Ms. Yamada Davis said‌‌. “We were so excited!”
She and her son contacted brands they wanted to work with, and a few responded.
“We were thrilled when we got paid $5,000 to do a video,” said Ms. Yamada Davis, who receives retirement income from a pension and Social Security, and shares her TikTok revenue with her son.
Now, with more than 15 million followers and an agent who negotiates for her, Ms. Yamada Davis said she and her son had been paid as much as $50,000 to create one video.
“I was such a nerd all my life,” said Ms. Yamada Davis, a retired software engineer. “Now sometimes I get recognized when I’m at a Starbucks.”

There are potential pitfalls for creators trying to build a product promotion business. Scammers may pose as brand representatives asking the creator to pay to ship a sample, or ask for their personal information, said Margaret Bourne, who coaches creators. She said frauds often include effusive, unprofessionally worded or misspelled messages and usually come from an unknown brand or company.
Creators also need to balance sponsored content and their own because users don’t want to tune in to a stream of commercials, said Lisa Pedace, 59, a comedian and an actor in San Diego who started ‌‌making content during the pandemic as a creative outlet and a way to connect with an audience. She now has more than 750,000 followers. Ms. Pedace has been hired by a variety of brands, including Amazon Prime and Valentino.
“When a brand approaches me, I think about if I can work it into a comedic skit because that is what people expect,” she said.
In a video for Pair Eyewear, a magnetic eyeglasses base frame that comes with a variety of top frame styles, Ms. Pedace swapped on different frames to play different characters.

Ms. Pedace said she wasn’t planning on retiring soon but was putting her growing TikTok income into savings. “The money is good and keeps getting better,” she said.
With its growth continuing, TikTok is likely to keep adding older users, and attracting the sponsored posts that target them.
“It’s boom time to be an elder content creator,” Ms. Karwowski said.
Tips for TikTok Influencing at Any Age
Find your video niche. Do viewers enjoy your wisdom, your humor, the way you interact with your Gen Z grandchild? Home in on what’s working and post your account bio on influencer networks like Obviously, TikTok Creator Marketplace, the Amazon influencer program, Upfluence, Collectively and Julius.
Build your presence by befriending other creators of all ages to help you tap into TikTok communities and trends. Comment on one another’s videos, collaborate, stitch, duet or post together to introduce your audiences to each other.
Attract sponsors by posting about products you love and tagging the company name. Brands keeping an eye out for fans may contact you. You can also email or message a brand and offer to be an ambassador. Mention your age and any other attributes that might help you stand out.
If you land a partnership, make sure your first one, whether you are receiving a free product or money, is well executed with clear messages and compelling visuals. Companies will review prior sponsored content when they evaluate you."
2023-06-04,"Were you planning on a last-minute trip to Orlando to visit Gov. Ron DeSantis’s favorite amusement park? “Prices are currently high for your search,” warns Google Flights. Well, yes they are.
And yes, fares have been high throughout our past two years of revenge-travel mode. Packed jets, ill-tempered passengers, bad airline management and weather roulette contributed to some miserable travel conditions last year, when more than 180,000 flights were canceled, according to Department of Transportation data. While the Federal Aviation Administration is corralling tantrum-throwing grown-ups, there’s not much the agency can do about climate-change-induced weather events.
The industry is also struggling with staffing shortages that have contributed to domestic airline capacity, relative to the economy, remaining below prepandemic levels. This summer, when our overheating climate starts spinning thunderstorms and hurricanes around the country, we could be back to business as miserable.
Against this backdrop of diminishing expectations, JetBlue Airways stood out. The carrier’s first flight took off in 2000 from busy, brusque Kennedy Airport and actually delivered on the promise of a better in-flight experience — bigger coach seats, more palatable food, free satellite television and pricing that got competitors’ attention. JetBlue’s history as a lower-priced disrupter is so well known it’s called the JetBlue effect. The mere threat of JetBlue sniffing out new turf is enough to keep the major players in check.

But now JetBlue wants to be a major player, too. It formed the Northeast Alliance with American Airlines in 2021 and a year later announced its planned acquisition of the ultralow-cost carrier Spirit Airlines. At a time when four airlines and their tightly coupled networks control 80 percent of domestic traffic, the U.S. government is fighting both deals. Last month a federal judge ordered JetBlue and American to disentangle the Northeast Alliance. American said it would appeal.
As a journalist who has covered big mergers and airline operations, I’m taking the government’s side in this fight. If JetBlue is allowed to grow as big as it wants, market forces figure to make the JetBlue Effect evaporate like a vapor trail from one of its jets."
2023-06-05,"Elon Musk recently said Twitter’s advertising business was on the upswing. “Almost all advertisers have come back,” he asserted, adding that the social media company could soon become profitable.
But Twitter’s U.S. advertising revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $88 million, down 59 percent from a year earlier, according to an internal presentation obtained by The New York Times. The company has regularly fallen short of its U.S. weekly sales projections, sometimes by as much as 30 percent, the document said.
That performance is unlikely to improve anytime soon, according to the documents and seven current and former Twitter employees.
Twitter’s ad sales staff is concerned that advertisers may be spooked by a rise in hate speech and pornography on the social network, as well as more ads featuring online gambling and marijuana products, the people said.

After Mr. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in October and took the company private, he vowed to build “the most respected ad platform.” But he quickly alienated advertisers by firing key sales executives, spreading a conspiracy theory on the site and welcoming back barred Twitter users.

In response, several large ad agencies and brands, including General Motors and Volkswagen, paused their ad spending on Twitter. Mr. Musk has said Twitter was on track to post $3 billion in revenue in 2023, down from $5.1 billion in 2021, when it was a public company.
Twitter’s valuation has since plunged. In March, Mr. Musk said the company was worth $20 billion, down more than 50 percent from the $44 billion he paid for it. Last week, the mutual funds giant Fidelity, which owns shares in Twitter, valued the company at $15 billion.
Twitter feels increasingly “unpredictable and chaotic,” said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, an association for premium publishers. “Advertisers want to run in an environment where they are comfortable and can send a signal about their brand,” he added.
Some of Twitter’s biggest advertisers — including Apple, Amazon and Disney — have been spending less on the platform than last year, three former and current Twitter employees said. Large specialized “banner” ads on Twitter’s trends page, which can cost $500,000 for 24 hours and are almost always bought by large brands to promote events, shows or movies, are often going unfilled, they said.
Twitter has also run into public relations snafus with big advertisers like Disney. In April, Twitter mistakenly gave a gold check mark — a badge meant to signify a paying advertiser — to the @DisneyJuniorUK account, which Disney doesn’t own. The account posted racial slurs, leading Disney officials to demand from Twitter an explanation and assurances that it wouldn’t happen again, two people with knowledge of the situation said.

Disney, Apple and Amazon declined to comment.
Six ad agency executives who have worked with Twitter said their clients continued to limit spending on the platform. They cited confusion over Mr. Musk’s changes to the service, inconsistent support from Twitter and concerns about the persistent presence of misleading and toxic content on the platform.
Last month, for instance, a picture that appeared to show an explosion near the Pentagon — which artificial intelligence experts identified as a synthetically generated image — was shared by dozens of Twitter accounts and briefly caused the stock market to tumble.
Some advertisers also continue to worry about Mr. Musk’s tweets. Last month, he posted several times comparing the billionaire financier George Soros, a frequent target for conspiracy theorists, to the “X-Men” comic book villain Magneto. Ted Deutch, the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, noted that both Mr. Soros and Magneto are Holocaust survivors, and that “the lie Jews want to destroy civilization has led to the persecution of Jewish people for centuries.”
“Musk should know better,” he said.
Last week, Ella Irwin, Twitter’s head of trust and safety, the division that oversees content moderation, and AJ Brown, the head of brand safety and ad quality, resigned, three current and former employees said. Ms. Irwin and Mr. Brown did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Musk has promoted new tools, known as adjacency controls, so advertisers can keep their ads away from tweets containing specific keywords or posts by certain users. Some advertisers are using the tools to keep their content away from Mr. Musk’s tweets, four people familiar with the situation said.

Still, some marketers are returning to the platform. GroupM, a media-buying organization that is part of the ad giant WPP, informed employees in May that it was removing its “high risk” flag on Twitter and guiding clients to return, at their discretion, to business as usual, two people familiar with the decision said. IPG, another large advertising company, has recommended that clients proceed with caution when dealing with Twitter, after suggesting last fall that they temporarily pause their spending.

Twitter is exploring ways to make it easier for advertisers to buy space on the platform, testing an automated system outside the United States to make deals, two people familiar with the arrangement said. Insider earlier reported the move.
The company is experiencing ad growth in areas that it once shied away from or prohibited, including online gambling and marijuana products. In one week last month, four of Twitter’s top 10 U.S. advertisers were online gambling and fantasy sports betting companies, according to one presentation. Twitter has also started allowing ads for cannabis accessories, including “bongs, vapes, rolling paper,” as well as erectile dysfunction products and services, according to internal emails.
Adult content, which is permitted on Twitter, has become a concern among the company’s sales staff. When some employees tried to drum up interest from advertisers for Mother’s Day, they found that potential sponsored search terms, like “MomLife,” surfaced pornographic videos, according to two people familiar with the conversations.

These are issues that some advertisers hope Ms. Yaccarino will solve.
Dave Campanelli, the chief investment officer of Horizon Media, said he was hoping for change after Ms. Yaccarino started, because media agencies like his struggled to maintain contact with Twitter last fall after Mr. Musk arrived.
“For a period, we weren’t even sure who to get on the phone with to talk to,” he said. “With Linda coming in, that could change that in a big way.”
He acknowledged that Twitter’s mercurial boss and volatile environment might pose a challenge for Ms. Yaccarino.
“It’s a tall order,” Mr. Campanelli said.

2023-06-06,"This article has been updated to include new information about Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s meetings with Saudi officials.
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — “Your final destination is Tel Aviv?”
I’ve been a reporter in the Middle East since 1979, and those are six words I’d never heard in the place where I was standing about the place where I was going.
I was checking in to fly from Doha, Qatar, to Tel Aviv, via Dubai. It was a once inconceivable connection, and now it tripped off the tongue of the FlyDubai agent at Doha International Airport with the same nonchalance as if she were asking if I was flying to Cairo via Riyadh.
My first instinct was to ask her: Could you please keep your voice down?
After all, many of us based in Beirut as reporters in the late 1970s didn’t even use the word “Israel.” We referred to it only as “Dixie” — the region south of Lebanon. Now the airport codes DIA, DXB and TLV were fused together on my luggage for all to see.

A few days later, I hopscotched to three more cities that suddenly seemed closer than ever: early breakfast in Tel Aviv; lunch in Amman, Jordan; and late dinner in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
This journey was unlike anything I’d ever experienced in a region that has long been my second home, and it allowed me to grasp something quite remarkable: how onetime enemies and rivals across the Middle East are on the cusp of becoming so much more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. It’s creating previously unthinkable partnerships, as well as huge internal stresses, as people in the neighborhood are trying to figure out just how modern, secular, open, entwined and democratic they want to be."

2023-06-08,"Over the last year, state legislators concerned about a mental health crisis among the nation’s young people have passed a raft of children’s online safety measures. A new Utah law would require social networks to obtain a parent’s consent before giving an account to a child younger than 18 while a new California law would require many sites to turn on the highest privacy settings for minors.
Now Louisiana lawmakers have passed an even broader bill that could affect access to large swaths of the internet for minors in the state.
The Louisiana measure would prohibit online services — including social networks, multiplayer games and video-sharing apps — from allowing people under 18 to sign up for accounts without parental consent. It would also allow Louisiana parents to cancel the terms-of-service contracts that their children signed for existing accounts on popular services like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Fortnite and Roblox.
The Louisiana civil code already allows parents to rescind contracts signed by unemancipated minors. Laurie Schlegel, the Republican state legislator who spearheaded the new measure, said her bill simply made it clear that the state’s existing contracting rules also covered accounts on online content-sharing platforms.

“This is already the law in Louisiana,” Ms. Schlegel said in an email, noting that young people lacked the capacity to understand and agree to the slew of contract terms that online services often require to open an account. “We are just making it clear to some irresponsible online companies who are contracting with minors without parental consent.”
On Tuesday, the Louisiana State House passed the bill by a vote of 97 to 0. The State Senate had already passed the measure. The bill now requires approval by Gov. John Bel Edwards, who has not taken a public stance on it. If he signs the bill, it will take effect Aug. 1 next year.

The state bill comes two weeks after the surgeon general issued a public advisory warning Americans that social media posed a serious risk to young people’s mental health and urging policymakers to limit access for children. It may be welcomed by many parents worried that their children are being inundated with inappropriate content or spending unhealthy amounts of time online.
TechNet, an industry group whose members include Meta, Snap, Google, Amazon, Apple and Uber, opposed the bill, saying it was overly broad and could cause friction for all users, including adults.

“The bill will require all users to provide proof of their age in order to comply with the law and ask parents to provide proof that they are the minor’s parent in order to access the platform,” Servando Esparza, TechNet’s executive director for Texas and the Southeast, said in an emailed statement. “This could jeopardize privacy and lead to unintended consequences,” he added, noting that Louisiana legislators had recently amended the bill to require research on its potential impact before the measure would take effect.

The Louisiana online contracts bill is part of a new wave of state laws this year regulating internet services that could pose risks to young people. And it underscores an escalating effort among Republican state legislators to give families more control over their children’s online activities.
Last year, Ms. Schlegel spearheaded the passage of a Louisiana law that requires sexually explicit sites to verify that users in the state are 18 or older by checking credentials like a verified digital driver’s license. The law took effect in January.
Since then, at least five states — Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana,Utah and Virginia — have passed similar age-verification laws for pornography sites.
In March, Republican lawmakers in Utah initiated the passage of a restrictive social media bill that would require social networks to verify a user’s age and obtain parental consent for minors to have accounts. The legislation would also give parents access to their child’s online posts and messages. Arkansas enacted a similar measure in April.

In May, the Free Speech Coalition, a group representing adult entertainment sites, sued Utah to try to block the pornography age-verification bill on free speech grounds, saying it violated Americans’ rights to view constitutionally protected information.
Civil liberties groups have raised similar concerns about broader child online safety bills, saying the measures could hinder young people from viewing online information.
The new Louisiana bill does not specifically require social media, multiplayer game and other sites and apps to verify the ages of users in the state. And it does not include specific penalties for companies that fail to comply.
Even so, it may cause some online services that currently ask new users to volunteer their birth dates to institute more stringent age-verification and parental-consent procedures.
Like Ms. Schlegel’s pornography bill, the new online contracting bill could also be widely copied. Civil codes in many other states have similar rules regarding contracts with minors.

2023-06-09,"This summer’s “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” is the latest of seven films in the long-running series of live-action films based on Hasbro’s hugely popular toy franchise; the first since the critically acclaimed 2018 spinoff, “Bumblebee”; and the first mainline installment since the Michael Bay-directed “Transformers: The Last Knight” (2017). Like all of the films in the series to date, “Rise of the Beasts” is based on characters first designed in 1984 as a line of children’s action figures, much like Mattel’s Masters of the Universe or Hasbro’s own G.I. Joe. But this new chapter also pulls from an unusual source: “Beast Wars: Transformers,” a somewhat obscure Canadian television show that ran from 1996 to 1999.

“Rise of the Beasts” takes place largely in New York in the 1990s, and follows the action-packed exploits of a race of powerful robots who live in disguise as cars and trucks, including the series hero Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen, reprising his role as voice actor from all of the previous films). This time around, Prime and his allies are joined by the Maximals, time-traveling Transformers from the distant future who turn into animals rather than vehicles: They include the rhinoceros Rhinox (David Sobolov), the falcon Airazor (Michelle Yeoh), the cheetah Cheetor (Tongayi Chirisa) and the gorilla Optimus Primal (Ron Perlman), a descendant of Prime. All of the new animal Transformers have been faithfully lifted from “Beast Wars,” which featured these characters living on a barren alien planet and doing battle with the nefarious Blackarachnia (a spider) and Scorponok (a scorpion), among other foes with similarly literal names.
“Beast Wars” was produced in Vancouver, British Columbia, by the animation company Mainframe Studios, which had previously developed “ReBoot,” a pioneering computer-animated series from the ’90s, for the popular Canadian children’s entertainment network YTV. Also fully computer-animated — at a time when that technology was still in its infancy — “Beast Wars” looked a little like a starker, more rudimentary version of “Toy Story,” with colorful, bulbous character models moving simply around sparse environments. The series ran for three seasons on YTV (under the more kid-friendly title “Beasties”) and in syndication across the United States, winning a Daytime Emmy for outstanding achievement in animation in 1998 and inspiring a TV sequel, several comic books and two video games — and now, almost three decades after its debut, a feature film (sort of).

Were it not for some of its characters and designs resurfacing this month in “Rise of the Beasts,” it seems likely that “Beast Wars” would have continued to recede into a lasting obsolescence, forgotten to all but the most nostalgic ’90s kids and most dedicated “Transformers” fans. And while the somewhat tangential connection to the source material may prevent the movie from kicking off a sudden torrent of interest in the Canadian series — “Rise of the Beasts” has not been especially billed as a “Beast Wars” movie, and the show has scarcely come up during press for the film — it’s still a good occasion to give the series its long-awaited due. Happily, the entire original run of “Beast Wars” was released on home video by Shout Factory in 2011 and is now available for purchase on Amazon Prime Video."
2023-06-10,"Four Colombian children who survived in the Colombian jungle for 40 days after their plane crashed were eager to play and asked for books to read, officials said on Saturday, one day after the group was rescued.  
The siblings, aged 1 to 13, were recuperating at a military hospital in Bogotá, the capital, and were said to be in good health and spirits on Saturday, when they were visited by President Gustavo Petro and other officials.
The country has been captivated by the children’s story, with many eagerly awaiting news of their fate since their plane crashed on May 1. The children, members of the Huitoto Indigenous community, had been traveling with their mother and an Indigenous leader from the tiny Amazon community of Araracuara, Colombia, to San José del Guaviare, a small city in central Colombia along the Guaviare River.
When rescuers reached the crash site last month, the bodies of the three adults with whom they were traveling were found, but there was no sign of the children.

Officials had said over the past few weeks that they had reason to believe the children survived the crash. When news of their survival and discovery broke on Friday, the country erupted in celebration.
Carlos Rincón, the military doctor who evaluated the children, said they had survived with only mild cuts and scrapes. In photos released by the government on Friday, the children appeared gaunt and the doctor said they were not yet receiving solid food. He said he expected they could be discharged from the hospital in two to three weeks.  
Defense Minister Iván Velásquez, who was among the officials to visit the children,  praised the oldest, Lesly Mucutuy, 13, for ensuring the survival of the group.  
“We have to recognize not only her courage, but also her leadership,” he said. “It was because of her that the three little siblings were able to survive by her side, with her care, with her knowledge of the jungle.”
Lesly’s 9-year-old sister, Soleiny, “talks a lot,” said Astrid Cáceres, director of the nation’s child welfare agency. Tien, 5, is asking for books to read, while the 1-year-old “has a tranquillity to work with the nurses that you cannot imagine,” Ms. Cáceres added.

“Lesly smiled at us, gave us hugs,” she said. “She wants to play, she is bored in bed.”
Two of the children’s birthdays passed during their time in the jungle. Tien turned five and the youngest, Cristin, turned one.
“The celebration of the birthdays is overdue,” Ms. Cáceres said at the news conference. “So we invite the country at this time to celebrate.
She added that the four children “have an assured education” because of “commitments with the president to protect and care for these children for their entire lives.”
The government has provided few details on how the children were located.
Special forces troops found the children late Friday afternoon by following footprints and traces of food, according to a military spokesman.
The children were “very weak,” he said. “I think if a few more days had passed we wouldn’t have found them alive.”

“Miracle, miracle miracle was the key word to report that they had found them,” he added.
In a coordinated search effort called Operation Hope, soldiers and Indigenous people covered approximately 1,650 miles while looking for the siblings.
After visiting the hospital along with his wife and two daughters, President Petro praised the cooperation between the military and Indigenous groups and the “respect for the jungle” on Twitter.
“Here is a different path for Colombia,” he wrote. “I believe that this is the true path to peace.”"

2023-06-12,"When Winnie and Alex Kemp submitted their first original fiction podcast “The Imperfection” to the 2021 Tribeca Festival, they set their expectations near the curb.
The couple, co-founders of the podcast studio Wolf at the Door, believed in the project. Making the nine-episode series — a surrealist caper about two impaired friends whose psychiatrist goes missing — had been a nearly yearlong labor of love, but early signals from the market had been humbling. An agent the couple hired to find distribution for the show had come back empty-handed, and emails to 200 journalists generated just one reply — a rejection.
At the Tribeca Festival, which dropped the word “film” from its name that year and expanded its focus on video games, virtual reality, music and audio, “The Imperfection” received a warmer reception. It was among the inaugural slate of 12 officially selected podcasts to premiere at the festival.
Being chosen by Tribeca meant “The Imperfection” was featured with the other festival selections on the Apple Podcasts and Audible home pages, helping it reach the top 20 of Apple Podcasts’ fiction chart. The show was later nominated for best podcast of the year and best fiction writing at The Ambie awards, the industry’s answer to the Oscars. And the Kemps got new representation with the Creative Artists Agency; last year, they sold the television rights to the show, and they will co-write the pilot script.
“It was a huge boon to us helping our first show get found,” Winnie Kemp said. “There are so many shows out there; the hardest thing to figure out is, ‘How do I cut through the noise?’”

Though it has never equaled the most prestigious galas of the film world, the Tribeca Festival, which began last Wednesday and will feature audio selections this week, has emerged as a uniquely appealing showcase for podcast creators. The demand for credible curatorial organizations is high in podcast land, where an explosion of titles — over two million have been created since the start of 2020, according to the database Listen Notes — has made it hard to break out even as overall listenership has increased.
While other festivals exist specifically for audio storytelling, and some documentary festivals include podcast selections, Tribeca’s history — it was founded in 2002 by Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff — and association with Hollywood talent have made it an instant player in the audio community.
“This is the next frontier of interesting, creative, independent storytelling — so much so that discoverability has been a challenge for audiences,” said Cara Cusumano, the director and vice president of programming at the Tribeca Festival. “That’s our forte; there was a place for us to play a role in this ecosystem and deliver an experience that you won’t find anywhere else.”

This year, 16 podcasts are competing for various awards in fiction and nonfiction categories. The selections include Alissa Escarce, Nellie Gilles and Joe Richman’s “The Unmarked Graveyard,” a documentary series about the anonymous dead of New York’s Hart Island cemetery; Georgie Aldaco’s “These Were Humans,” a sketch comedy series that imagines the artifacts of an extinct human race; and Glynnis MacNicol, Emily Marinoff and Jo Piazza’s “Wilder,” a nonfiction series about the life and legacy of the “Little House on the Prairie” author Laura Ingalls Wilder.
The festival will also host live tapings and premieres of several podcasts that are not in competition, including “Pod Save America,” Crooked Media’s popular political talk show; “Just Jack & Will,” the actors Sean Hayes and Eric McCormack’s new “Will & Grace” rewatch podcast and “You Feeling This?” an Los Angeles-centric fiction anthology from James Kim.
Davy Gardner, the curator of audio storytelling at Tribeca, said the festival aims to demonstrate that podcasts deserve a comparable level of “cultural recognition” to films.
“Tribeca is giving these creators the full red-carpet treatment,” he said. “This is its own art form and we want to help elevate it and push it forward.”
Film festivals have long been the envy of audio artists. In the early 1990s, Sundance helped create a vogue for independent and art-house films that blossomed into a booming market. Filmmakers who entered the festival with few resources and no name recognition could exit it with the backing of a major studio and a burgeoning career.
No similar infrastructure exists for independent podcasters. As major funders like Spotify and Amazon have consolidated around easy-to-monetize true-crime documentaries and celebrity interview shows — a trend that has intensified amid industrywide economic woes and a series of layoffs — many artists have struggled to find support for less obviously commercial work.

“If you don’t have a promotional budget or aren’t attached to a big network it’s really hard to find an audience,” said Bianca Giaever, whose memoiristic podcast “Constellation Prize” was featured by the Tribeca Festival in 2021. (She is also a former producer of the Times’ podcast “The Daily”). “It’s a vicious cycle, because then less of that work gets made.”

Of course, even award-winning films at the biggest festivals don’t always become hits. And podcast creators at Tribeca have to compete for audiences and prospective business partners accustomed to filling their schedules with movie premieres.
Johanna Zorn, who co-founded the long-running Third Coast International Audio Festival and presented audio work at multiple documentary film festivals in the 2010s, said the payoff sometimes fell short of the promise.
“We went to some fabulous film festivals and we were happy to be there,” she said. “But did they help us get real press coverage? Get us into a room with people who could lead us to the next thing? Give us something that we could really build on? Not so much.”
To cast the podcast selections in an optimal light, Gardner and his colleagues have had to learn how to exhibit an art form not customarily experienced in a communal setting. They have planned around a dozen events at theaters and other venues around Manhattan that will pair excerpts from featured work with live discussions or supplementary video.
One thing they won’t include? Quiet rooms with only an audio track and an empty stage.
“I’ve tried it,” Gardner said wearily. “It’s incredibly awkward.”"

After connecting on the dating app Hinge, the two agreed to meet on March 22, 2018 at Goodnight Sonny, a bar in Manhattan’s East Village.
“We instantly bonded while consuming spicy margaritas and laughing,” said Ms. Ming, 30, a vice president for business operations at the Global Atlantic Financial Group, an insurance and annuities provider in New York. She had graduated from Dartmouth with a bachelor’s degree in government and public policy.
“He was interested in me and curious about what kept me busy,” she said.
Mr. Gold, 31, a software engineer at Amazon, found Ms. Ming gregarious and engaging, as well as intellectual and kind. “I was impressed by her and hoped she felt similarly about me,” said Mr. Gold, who has a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in computer science from Stanford.

At 1 a.m., they had closed the bar down. Then she followed Mr. Gold to the roof deck of a friend’s apartment, for which he had the entry code, just two blocks away. They shared their first kiss on the deck, which overlooked Tompkins Square Park.
“I wanted to keep talking to him,” said Ms. Ming, adding that she had found Mr. Gold refreshing and different and “felt giddy and sparked by him.”
She got her wish. Just hours later, he texted Ms. Ming and asked her out to dinner.
Their relationship moved quickly. The two spent the next six months falling in love by seeing New York City through each other’s eyes. This included hundreds of bike rides, hot yoga classes, Yankees games, food tours through Astoria, Queens, and batting cages in the Bronx.

2023-06-17,"In the summer of 2019, Jacqueline Lobel, a 33-year-old TV producer, was scrolling through Craigslist, optimistically hoping to buy a dining room table that would fit into a slightly dark space in the large studio apartment she had just moved into in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn.
“When I saw how this apartment was staged before I rented it, I was inspired to do the same layout, so I knew what kind of table I needed,” she said.
Two months into her search, she saw a post that promised a gorgeous, 42-inch walnut wood and brass dining room table in good condition. It was part of the décor at Günter Seeger, a Michelin-starred restaurant that was closing in the West Village. The custom-made table retailed for $3,000. The proprietors were offering it for $500. She bought it for that price.
“I met the owners and could tell they were sad about selling these pieces. There’s romanticism and story behind them,” said Ms. Lobel, who has learned that anything and everything is findable — and sellable — on e-commerce sites, especially Facebook Marketplace.

So naturally Ms. Lobel turned to Facebook Marketplace two years later when that same table fell out of favor.
“I loved it, but I was too precious about damaging it to use it,” she said. “I think I had two or three dinners on it before it became a visual clutter and dumping ground for packages.”
Despite the awkwardness Ms. Lobel said she feels when interacting with strangers, she loves enthusiastic buyers who will give her furniture “a happy place” to live. “I’m continuing a cycle. I’m getting rid of something to bring something else in.” (Last year she scored an impressive vintage camel leather couch for $50.)
She posted photos and descriptions of the table in November 2022, but it sat unclaimed for a month before she refreshed the posting. The following day, the table was spotted by Ruth Gallogly, 51, a freelance writer and consultant who lives in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn.
After a few messages and some texts, Ms. Gallogly said she sent over “a guy with a van that I use when something needs to be picked up.” The mover measured the piece, confirmed it was the right size, and Ms. Gallogly paid Ms. Lobel $500 by Venmo.

An hour later it glowed in Ms. Gallogly’s kitchen in her one-bedroom co-op. “Now it’s become this warm, welcoming hosting spot,” said Ms. Gallogly, who had been trying to fill the space since she renovated her apartment in 2021. “I loved the table, but I also loved the back story and the history this piece of furniture had to tell,” she said. “I share it with everyone who visits.”
And so it goes. A furniture handoff sparking an unexpected relationship.
“People are looking for connection. Through this transaction you’re continuing a thread through a shared piece of furniture,” said Charles Lindsey, an associate professor of marketing at University at Buffalo School of Management, whose focus is on the psychology of consumption and consumer behavior.
“That’s how you can share a piece of someone’s life,” Mr. Lindsey added. “It’s also the new story you’re creating by extending the history of something that someone owned by how you display it and embrace that item. It makes buying something from someone else psychologically attractive.”
E-commerce sites offer that attraction to millions of consumers, from the amateur sleuth to the full-blown shopping addict.

Ms. Gallogly, who likes the hunt, has furnished her home over the past year with more than 20 items from Marketplace. “I’m one of those people who knows what I like once I see it but who has a hard time visualizing how things will look in a space or what colors will work well together,” she said.

Sylvain Sénécal, a marketing professor at the business school HEC Montreal who specializes in digital marketing and consumer behavior, said Ms. Gallogly was not alone.
“The social proof and inspiration these items create when someone sees how one person highlighted it in their apartment and how someone else can do the same in their home is part of the draw,” he said. “For potential buyers, that becomes aspirational. It triggers something that increases their willingness to buy something.”
Last year, Mr. Sénécal conducted an online experiment. He showed 335 participants a dozen photos from a pool of 60. In some, the photos showed only a bare table or bed. Others were staged to reflect a lived-in environment or an indication that a person had a personal connection to it.
“The staged shots increased the person’s emotions, motivation or intention to buy the product,” he said. “They have an easier time imagining that item in their home, especially if they think the item was connected to happiness.”

Like many shoppers, Ms. Gallogly doesn’t identify as just a buyer, she also quickly became a seller, adding to the momentum of a continuous furniture circulating chain. In 2019 she purchased a gray and white marbleized oval coffee table from CB2, which she adored. That feeling never changed, but her surroundings did. After the renovation, it no longer went with the décor.
“The idea that this was in my home and I loved it, and that I’m able to pass this along to someone else who will love it is very settling,” she said.
She posted the oval table at the end of December 2022. At $400, it wasn’t getting any inquiries. She lowered the price to $350. Then $300.
When Kristen Daibes and her husband moved from their small one-bedroom rental in Edgewater, N.J., in 2020 into a 1920s colonial-style three-bedroom house in Harrington Park, N.J., they suddenly had extra rooms to furnish.
Ms. Daibes, a 30-year-old elementary teacher, wanted something oval that was white and gray to complete a family room, and spent six months scrolling on Marketplace. She was instantly smitten with Ms. Gallogly’s table, but it was out of her budget until the price dropped. When it went to $275, she pounced. In January of 2023, she stood alongside her husband, Ghanem Daibes, in Ms. Gallogly’s hallway.

“Once I saw it, I started envisioning it in our room, with a candle placed on it, and yelling at my husband for not using a coaster,” she said. “I’m a big secondhand person, my husband is not. I had to sell him on this concept, and the coffee table.”
The piece now resides alongside a piano and two couches, under a skylight in their family room. “As unsentimental and boring as a coffee table is, there’s an acknowledgment that someone loved this item in their home and it is now in mine. I’m giving it a second life,” she added.
Ms. Daibes’s satisfaction and sentimentality, which seemed rather passionate in the beginning, was surprisingly short lived.
“None of these pieces last in our home forever,” she added. “I’ll probably sell it in a few years.”
Her ability to maintain detachment is what led her to sell a full-length mirrored door, that when opened, revealed drawers, compartments and countless slots to hold jewelry, which she bought on Amazon in 2017 for over $200.
“It was important to have at the time. When we moved, it didn’t fit with our home  and I didn’t have the jewelry to fill it.”

No worries. Mary Jo Birrittieri-Parente had plenty of jewelry.
Early in the pandemic, Ms. Daibes and Ms. Birrittieri-Parente  met in a busy Target’s parking lot in Closter, N.J., to do a handoff, three days after Ms. Daibes posted it on Marketplace.
“I got involved in Marketplace during Covid because stores were closed or they didn’t have inventory,” said Ms. Birrittieri-Parente, a 51-year-old, former medical receptionist, who lives in a two-bedroom condominium in Bergen County, N.J., with her daughter.
Ms. Birrittieri-Parente, a single parent who appreciates the bargains offered by sites like Marketplace, has accumulated more than 90 pieces of costume jewelry. “I needed something that would organize them all in one place and I needed a full-length mirror,” she said.
The exchange in the parking lot lasted only a few minutes, and after Ms. Birrittieri-Parente determined the piece reflected what the photos promised, handed over the negotiated price: $30 in cash, down from the original ask of $60. The multitasking armoire fit into her black SUV. Minutes later it was propped up in her bedroom.
“This breathed new life into me and this room while making it more modern,” she said. “Everything has its own place now. I love that it’s white and goes with my furniture. It doesn’t matter that it was someone else’s. It’s brand-new to me and my home.”

The furniture tango is always moving and constantly changing partners. Sometimes the dance is  easy, other times, not so much.
Ms. Lobel, who felt an emotional loss at selling the round table, was soothed by quickly filling the once empty space with a bookshelf, chest and reading chair — all bought secondhand, and by the fact that Ms. Gallogly was so thrilled at the find, and purchase.
“It was a beautiful piece. But I empathized with Ruth deeply,” she said. “I was her three years ago looking for a beautiful round table. Knowing I helped her find that made it more sweet than bitter.”"
2023-06-18,"When the world’s business and political leaders gathered in 2018 at the annual economic forum in Davos, the mood was jubilant. Growth in every major country was on an upswing. The global economy, declared Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, “is in a very sweet spot.”
Five years later, the outlook has decidedly soured.
“Nearly all the economic forces that powered progress and prosperity over the last three decades are fading,” the World Bank warned in a recent analysis. “The result could be a lost decade in the making — not just for some countries or regions as has occurred in the past — but for the whole world.”
A lot has happened between then and now: A global pandemic hit; war erupted in Europe; tensions between the United States and China boiled. And inflation, thought to be safely stored away with disco album collections, returned with a vengeance.
But as the dust has settled, it has suddenly seemed as if almost everything we thought we knew about the world economy was wrong.

The economic conventions that policymakers had relied on since the Berlin Wall fell more than 30 years ago — the unfailing superiority of open markets, liberalized trade and maximum efficiency — look to be running off the rails.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, the ceaseless drive to integrate the global economy and reduce costs left health care workers without face masks and medical gloves, carmakers without semiconductors, sawmills without lumber and sneaker buyers without Nikes.

And increasing bouts of extreme weather that destroyed crops, forced migrations and halted power plants has illustrated that the market’s invisible hand was not protecting the planet.
Now, as the second year of war in Ukraine grinds on and countries struggle with limp growth and persistent inflation, questions about the emerging economic playing field have taken center stage.
Globalization, seen in recent decades as unstoppable a force as gravity, is clearly evolving in unpredictable ways. The move away from an integrated world economy is accelerating. And the best way to respond is a subject of fierce debate.
Of course, challenges to the reigning economic consensus had been growing for a while.
“We saw before the pandemic began that the wealthiest countries were getting frustrated by international trade, believing — whether correctly or not — that somehow this was hurting them, their jobs and standards of living,” said Betsey Stevenson, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration.
The financial meltdown in 2008 came close to tanking the global financial system. Britain pulled out of the European Union in 2016. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on China in 2017, spurring a mini trade war.

It was the ‘end of history.’
Today’s sense of unease is a stark contrast with the heady triumphalism that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991. It was a period when a theorist could declare that the fall of communism marked “the end of history” — that liberal democratic ideas not only vanquished rivals, but represented “the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution.”

Associated economic theories about the ineluctable rise of worldwide free market capitalism took on a similar sheen of invincibility and inevitability. Open markets, hands-off government and the relentless pursuit of efficiency would offer the best route to prosperity.
It was believed that a new world where goods, money and information crisscrossed the globe would essentially sweep away the old order of Cold War conflicts and undemocratic regimes.
There was reason for optimism. During the 1990s, inflation was low while employment, wages and productivity were up. Global trade nearly doubled. Investments in developing countries surged. The stock market rose.
The World Trade Organization was established in 1995 to enforce the rules. China’s entry six years later was seen as transformative. And linking a huge market with 142 countries would irresistibly draw the Asian giant toward democracy.

The favored economic road map helped produce fabulous wealth, lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and spur wondrous technological advances.
But there were stunning failures as well. Globalization hastened climate change and deepened inequalities.
In the United States and other advanced economies, many industrial jobs were exported to lower-wage countries, removing a springboard to the middle class.
Policymakers always knew there would be winners and losers. Still, the market was left to decide how to deploy labor, technology and capital in the belief that efficiency and growth would automatically follow. Only afterward, the thinking went, should politicians step in to redistribute gains or help those left without jobs or prospects.

Companies embarked on a worldwide scavenger hunt for low-wage workers, regardless of worker protections, environmental impact or democratic rights. They found many of them in places like Mexico, Vietnam and China.
Television, T-shirts and tacos were cheaper than ever, but many essentials like health care, housing and higher education were increasingly out of reach.
The job exodus pushed down wages at home and undercut workers’ bargaining power, spurring anti-immigrant sentiments and strengthening hard-right populist leaders like Donald Trump in the United States, Viktor Orban in Hungary and Marine Le Pen in France.
In advanced industrial giants like the United States, Britain and several European countries, political leaders turned out to be unable or unwilling to more broadly reapportion rewards and burdens.
Nor were they able to prevent damaging environmental fallout. Transporting goods around the globe increased greenhouse gas emissions. Producing for a world of consumers strained natural resources, encouraging overfishing in Southeast Asia and illegal deforestation in Brazil. And cheap production facilities polluted countries without adequate environmental standards.

It turned out that markets on their own weren’t able to automatically distribute gains fairly or spur developing countries to grow or establish democratic institutions.
Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said in a recent speech that a central fallacy in American economic policy had been to assume “that markets always allocate capital productively and efficiently — no matter what our competitors did, no matter how big our shared challenges grew, and no matter how many guardrails we took down.”
The proliferation of economic exchanges between nations also failed to usher in a promised democratic renaissance.
Communist-led China turned out to be the global economic system’s biggest beneficiary — and perhaps master gamesman — without embracing democratic values.
“Capitalist tools in socialist hands,” the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said in 1992, when his country was developing into the world’s factory floor. China’s astonishing growth transformed it into the world’s second largest economy and a major engine of global growth. All along, though, Beijing maintained a tight grip on its raw materials, land, capital, energy, credit and labor, as well as the movements and speech of its people.

Money flowed in, and poor countries paid the price.
In developing countries, the results could be dire.
The economic havoc wreaked by the pandemic combined with soaring food and fuel prices caused by the war in Ukraine have created a spate of debt crises. Rising interest rates have made those crises worse. Debts, like energy and food, are often priced in dollars on the world market, so when U.S. rates go up, debt payments get more expensive.
The cycle of loans and bailouts, though, has deeper roots.
Poorer nations were pressured to lift all restrictions on capital moving in and out of the country. The argument was that money, like goods, should flow freely among nations. Allowing governments, businesses and individuals to borrow from foreign lenders would finance industrial development and key infrastructure.
“Financial globalization was supposed to usher in an era of robust growth and fiscal stability in the developing world,” said Jayati Ghosh, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. But “it ended up doing the opposite.”

Some loans — whether from private lenders or institutions like the World Bank — didn’t produce enough returns to pay off the debt. Others were poured into speculative schemes, half-baked proposals, vanity projects or corrupt officials’ bank accounts. And debtors remained at the mercy of rising interest rates that swelled the size of debt payments in a heartbeat.
Over the years, reckless lending, asset bubbles, currency fluctuations and official mismanagement led to boom-and-bust cycles in Asia, Russia, Latin America and elsewhere. In Sri Lanka, extravagant projects undertaken by the government, from ports to cricket stadiums, helped drive the country into bankruptcy last year as citizens scavenged for food and the central bank, in a barter arrangement, paid for Iranian oil with tea leaves.
It’s a “Ponzi scheme,” Ms. Ghosh said.
Private lenders who got spooked that they would not be repaid abruptly cut off the flow of money, leaving countries in the lurch.
And the mandated austerity that accompanied bailouts from the International Monetary Fund, which compelled overextended governments to slash spending, often brought widespread misery by cutting public assistance, pensions, education and health care.
Even I.M.F. economists acknowledged in 2016 that instead of delivering growth, such policies “increased inequality, in turn jeopardizing durable expansion.”

Self-reliance replaces cheap imports.
While the collapse of the Soviet Union cleared the way for the domination of free-market orthodoxy, the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation has now decisively unmoored it.
The story of the international economy today, said Henry Farrell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, is about “how geopolitics is gobbling up hyperglobalization.”
Old-world style great power politics accomplished what the threat of catastrophic climate collapse, seething social unrest and widening inequality could not: It upended assumptions about the global economic order.

Josep Borrell, the European Union’s head of foreign affairs and security policy, put it bluntly in a speech 10 months after the invasion of Ukraine: “We have decoupled the sources of our prosperity from the sources of our security.” Europe got cheap energy from Russia and cheap manufactured goods from China. “This is a world that is no longer there,” he said.
Supply-chain chokeholds stemming from the pandemic and subsequent recovery had already underscored the fragility of a globally sourced economy. As political tensions over the war grew, policymakers quickly added self-reliance and strength to the goals of growth and efficiency.
“Our supply chains are not secure, and they’re not resilient,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said last spring. Trade relationships should be built around “trusted partners,” she said, even if it means “a somewhat higher level of cost, a somewhat less efficient system.”
“It was naïve to think that markets are just about efficiency and that they’re not also about power,” said Abraham Newman, a co-author with Mr. Farrell of “Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy.”
Economic networks, by their very nature, create power imbalances and pressure points because countries have varying capabilities, resources and vulnerabilities.

China has retaliated against trading partners by restricting access to its enormous market.
The extreme concentrations of critical suppliers and information technology networks has generated additional choke points.

China manufactures 80 percent of the world’s solar panels. Taiwan produces 92 percent of tiny advanced semiconductors. Much of the world’s trade and transactions are figured in U.S. dollars.
The new reality is reflected in American policy. The United States — the central architect of the liberalized economic order and the World Trade Organization — has turned away from more comprehensive free trade agreements and repeatedly refused to abide by W.T.O. decisions.
Security concerns have led the Biden administration to block Chinese investment in American businesses and limit China’s access to private data on citizens and to new technologies.
And it has embraced Chinese-style industrial policy, offering gargantuan subsidies for electric vehicles, batteries, wind farms, solar plants and more to secure supply chains and speed the transition to renewable energy.
“Ignoring the economic dependencies that had built up over the decades of liberalization had become really perilous,” Mr. Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, said. Adherence to “oversimplified market efficiency,” he added, proved to be a mistake.

In the 2020-21 academic year, Black students accounted for just under 3 percent of the economics doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, according to the U.S. Department of Education. That was even lower than their 4.8 percent share of doctorates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, according to the federal data. And there’s been no visible improvement in records going back to 1995. Women, Hispanics and Native Americans are also underrepresented, but I’m going to focus on African Americans in this newsletter in recognition of the Juneteenth federal holiday.
Image
“The root cause of this underrepresentation is unknown,” a report this year by the American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession said. It offered some tentative explanations, which included: There are few role models for Black students and other minorities on economics faculties; some instructors may hold “low expectations and negative implicit stereotypes”; some minority students lack confidence in their abilities or lack “information about economics and what economists do.”
For another perspective, I interviewed Samuel L. Myers Jr., a Black economist at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, about the efforts he and others are making to educate younger generations of minority scholars to become Ph.D. economists. He gave a keynote speech on Friday at an annual gathering in Washington of minority scholars and their mentors under the auspices of the American Economic Association.

Myers has his own theories for the dearth of Black scholars with doctorates in economics. One is the closing of economics departments at historically Black colleges and universities. Another is that economics, in his view, has “gotten so far away from the type of analysis that is germane” to issues that matter to many Black people, such as police brutality. He also said economists focus too much on advanced statistical techniques to try to draw inferences from incomplete or faulty data and too little on “institutional dynamics,” such as those that led to the housing bubble and bust of the 2000s.
The conference in Washington last Thursday through Saturday combined two groups of students: undergraduates who are taking courses at Howard University that will prepare them for possible entry into doctoral programs and older students who are close to completing their doctorates or recently completed them and need help getting jobs."

Hope but few details
Worries about China’s economic recovery sent stocks and U.S. futures lower on Tuesday morning, despite a promising meeting on Monday between the country’s top leader, Xi Jinping, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Beijing.
The discussions raised hopes that the world’s two biggest economies might stabilize relations, but the market reaction points at the deeper challenges for policymakers and business.
The mood music was positive. Xi said the two sides had “made progress” and President Biden told reporters in California that Blinken had done “a hell of a job.” But that just talking generated such excitement is a sign of how tense relations have become. There was no agreement or detail on the most contentious issues: restrictions on Chinese access to advanced technologies; accusations that the U.S. and its allies want to contain Beijing’s ambitions; Taiwan; the war in Ukraine.
“Distrust remains high,” said Noah Barkin, a specialist on China relations at the research firm Rhodium Group. “For international investors, this is not enough to trigger any sort of rethink with regard to the Chinese market.” The Biden administration, he said, would continue screening strategic investments into China and Beijing showed no signs of easing pressure on foreign firms operating in the country.
Business is de-risking rather than decoupling. Raytheon’s C.E.O., Greg Hayes, said it was “impossible” to break away entirely from China because of the complexity of supply chains and the level of U.S. trade with the country, while the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is reportedly looking to spin off its China unit, according to The Financial Times.
China has big domestic concerns, too. The country’s central bank cut its prime lending rate today and Goldman Sachs lowered its growth outlook for the country over the weekend. “For business, the issue is not so much China-U.S. relations per se, but the very worrying state of the Chinese economy at present. Awareness of how challenged that is was probably one of the main issues that created a more communicative China, one that is willing to show just a bit of compromise at the moment,” said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese studies at King’s College London and a former British diplomat in Beijing.
Yu Jie, a China expert at Chatham House, a British think-tank, added that Xi still hoped “that Western business could be part of his plan to generate much-needed growth and employment.”

The stakes of the submersible rescue effort
Rescuers are still searching for a submersible that disappeared near the wreckage of the Titanic on Sunday, racing against time to find the vessel in the vastness of the sea.
The submersible’s disappearance is a reminder of the risks associated with the extreme tourism business — especially as space exploration companies like Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin take flight.

Time is ticking. Coast Guard officials estimated that the Titan submersible, which disappeared Sunday morning, theoretically had between 70 to 96 hours of air as of late yesterday afternoon. (That is, if its hull is intact.) Among the five people on board are Hamish Harding, a wealthy British adventurer and aviation executive, and Paul Henry Nargeolet, a French expert on the Titanic.

American and Canadian aircraft, as well as commercial vessels, were looking for the Titan, while sonar buoys had been deployed. But here’s a good explainer about how difficult it may be to find the vehicle and rescue its occupants.
The business of exploring the extremes is booming. OceanGate Expeditions, which operates the Titan, has been charging up to $250,000 a seat since 2021 to tour the undersea remains of the Titanic.
While well-heeled vacationers have long paid to take glamorous risks — hiking up Mount Everest or swimming with great whites — the most wealthy have increasingly flocked to the frontiers offered by space travel. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic (not to be confused with the failed Virgin Orbit) is selling tickets for suborbital flight for $450,000 apiece, while one ticket on a Blue Origin flight last year reportedly went for $1.25 million.

UTA makes an even bigger sports bet
United Talent Agency, whose A-list clients range from the actor Timothée Chalamet to the singers Post Malone and Lizzo, is expanding further into media and sports by acquiring James & Co., an executive search firm specializing in the sector, for an undisclosed amount, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch is first to report.
Talent agencies have been diving into sports, echoing moves by technology giants to throw cash at one of the few sectors still driving eyeballs to live television. Last year, Creative Artists Agency, which represents Dwyane Wade, Steven Spielberg and Zendaya, bought its rival ICM, in part to push further into sports. CAA’s clients include the football star Aaron Rodgers, basketball’s Chris Paul and the Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo.
UTA acquired a majority stake in 2019 in Klutch Sports Group, which represents the NBA’s LeBron James. This year UTA named Andrew Thau, its chief operating officer, as its head of sports, alongside Klutch’s founder, Rich Paul.
UTA and its rivals are seeking scale to strengthen their negotiating power with streaming powerhouses like Amazon, Netflix, and Apple. UTA bought the literary agency Fletcher & Company in January after acquiring the London-based Curtis Brown last year. Those deals strengthened its roster of contemporary novelists and nonfiction writers, giving it more intellectual property that could be turned into films or TV series.

2023-06-21,"After more than 30 years as a producer and engineer, Brad Wood wasn’t sure if he still had a future in music.
Wood, a classically trained saxophonist, had gotten his start in Chicago’s early ’90s music scene, helming breakthrough albums for Liz Phair and Veruca Salt, and platinum records for Smashing Pumpkins and Placebo. In 2000, he moved to Southern California, where he thrived for a time — and then merely survived, as the downloading era sank recording budgets just as the brand of guitar rock he specialized in lost cultural relevancy.
While many of his colleagues gave up, Wood kept going, working harder while earning less. “I probably got to the point where I was making the same rate as when I started,” he said.
Then, in 2021, an emergent technology ushered Wood — and thousands of recording professionals like him — into an unexpected boom time.

Over the past two years, Wood has been busy mixing old and new records in Dolby Atmos, an audio format that lets engineers create a listening experience more immersive than traditional stereo by placing sounds around and above the listener. Working for a variety of labels, Wood has done Atmos mixes for the Supremes, the Pogues, Jennifer Lopez, Modest Mouse, Gwen Stefani and Soul Asylum — some 300-plus tracks in total, the equivalent of two dozen albums.
“The whole thing has been pretty unexpected and thrilling,” he said.
For Dolby, the audio company that developed Atmos, and Apple Music — which has invested heavily in it — the technology could lead to the most dramatic shift in audio in 65 years.
“The recording industry went from mono to stereo decades ago, and it didn’t move from there,” John Couling, senior vice president of Dolby Laboratories, said in a phone interview.
There have been efforts to convince the public to adopt new advanced technologies in the years since, ‌including Quadraphonic sound in the ’70s ‌and 5.1 surround sound in the ’90s, but with little success. “We’ve changed formats, we’ve changed delivery methods, we’ve changed all sorts of things,” Couling said, “but it was still fundamentally the same sound. Atmos is a completely new experience.”
Oliver Schusser, a vice president at Apple Music, said that his company, which has incentivized record labels to deliver catalog material in Atmos, sees it as a way to bring sonic value back to music — something that’s been lost among a whole generation that has come up during the streaming era.

“There was no appreciation of the art and work of sound engineers and mixing and mastering,” Schusser said over a video call this spring. “That really pained us. We wanted to fix that.”
Today, all three major record labels and hundreds of independents are delivering tracks in Atmos. Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal and QQ Music are among the 15 streaming services bringing Atmos to 160 countries and over 500 million listeners.
“But mention the word ‘Atmos’ to anyone in the general public and they don’t know what the hell you’re talking about,” said the veteran engineer and producer Bob Clearmountain. One of the most respected and influential figures in the recording world, Clearmountain was initially dubious of Atmos’s staying power, but he has come to believe in its future.
“Music has become background noise for most people. It’s something in your headphones while you’re out doing other stuff,” he said during a call last month. “When I was a teenager, I used to listen to an album three, four times through just sitting in front of my speakers, entranced.” That way of listening has disappeared, he said, but he’s hopeful that Atmos can bring it back, “if we’re able to get people to understand what it is and hear it the right way.”
From the outside, it appears Atmos is entering a critical period that could determine whether it will kick off a sonic revolution or become just another tech lost to time.

DOLBY ATMOS, INTRODUCED in 2012, was initially developed for movie theaters and the home theater market. Because it offers a wider palette than stereo, and differs from traditional 5.1 and 7.1 channel setups, Atmos allows engineers — typically mixing across a dozen or more speakers — to put sound sources in front, to the side, behind and even above the listener.

“When you take sounds and you separate them from each other,” Couling said, “you will be able to hear those sounds independently much more clearly than if they are on top of each other. By creating space, we also create depth and clarity — and we found that’s what content creators really wanted.”
For artists like Chic’s founder, Nile Rodgers, immersive audio is the closest thing to the musician’s experience. “When I’m making a record, I’m sitting in a room with the band,” Rodgers said during a video chat, “we’re playing and jamming and what happens is the sound is bathing us. That’s what music sounds like to me.”
Listening to Dolby Atmos mixes in a professional recording studio can be a powerful experience. “It’s remarkably seductive,” said Clearmountain, who’s done Atmos projects for Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones and others. “I’ve played Atmos tracks for so many people who say, ‘I can never listen to stereo again.’ People have been in tears, moved by what they were hearing. It has an incredible effect.”
Opinions among recording professionals on any subject are rarely uniform, and there are some who have reservations about Atmos.
Susan Rogers, a longtime engineer for Prince, left the music industry in the late ’90s to become a cognitive neuroscientist. Last fall, Dolby invited her to the company headquarters in San Francisco to listen to a new Atmos mix of Prince’s “When Doves Cry,” a track she originally worked on.

“As both an engineer and as a psychoacoustician, I have mixed feelings about whether it’s an improvement,” Rogers said in a phone interview.
She noted that there are evolutionary and biological reasons that sound sources coming from behind and above listeners can be unsettling or anxiety inducing. She also observed that music is a potent form of communication in large part because the consummatory phase happens entirely in the listener’s head. Having clearer and more sound sources can actually make it harder to know what to pay attention to.
“That was what I noticed listening to ‘When Doves Cry’ in Atmos,” Rogers said. “It sounded amazing, but it was more difficult to assemble it into a unified whole in that private place I listen to music. I found it distracting.” Her “knee-jerk reaction was ‘do not want,’” she said. “But over time I may learn to like it.”
APPLE MUSIC IS betting heavily that the public will, by and large, come to love Atmos. Although other companies, including Amazon, had flirted with the technology, in 2021 Apple decided to commit itself fully to Atmos, putting its own proprietary and branding spin on the tech, dubbing it “spatial” audio.
Strategically, Atmos offers Apple Music a way to further distinguish itself from streaming competitors like Spotify — which has historically ignored high resolution or advanced audio options — and siphon market share from the industry’s dominant music service, YouTube.
“We wanted something where people would notice a difference immediately,” said Schusser, the Apple Music executive. “Maybe not 100 percent would love Atmos or spatial audio right away, but everyone would know this sounds different, and the hope is the majority would come to appreciate the upgrade.”

Initially, Apple’s biggest challenge was that there was very little Atmos content available. In 2017, R.E.M.’s “Automatic for the People” became the first album mixed for Atmos, and over the next few years, several notable Atmos releases — from Elton John, Queen and the Beatles — showcased the format’s possibilities.
To achieve its broader aims, Apple needed to make Atmos content both viable and plentiful. It began by partnering with Dolby to encourage recording studios to upgrade to the format. There are now some 800 officially recognized Dolby Atmos studios in over 40 countries, a 350 percent increase in just two years. (Dolby estimates there are two or three times that number of other studios capable of delivering music in Atmos.)
Apple Music also drew up wish lists of artists, albums and tracks and presented them to record labels, along with funding and deadlines, to help quickly expand the library of titles available in Atmos. Over the past few years, this effort to refit 50 years of pop music has heralded a rush of work for engineers and mixers, who’ve suddenly found themselves doing volume business in the format.
Wood, initially dismissive of learning to work in Atmos, said he changed his mind once he realized the inevitability of its rise. “It was clear that records I’d made were going to get mixed in Atmos,” he said, “and if I didn’t learn how to do it, somebody else would, and I’d be ceding that control.” Wood’s first Atmos mix was for Liz Phair’s “Soberish,” an album he’d originally produced. “And, also, I realized there would be a good payday in learning,” he added.
While contemporary pop and hip-hop artists were quick to adopt the format for new releases, convincing veteran rock acts to enter the Atmos fray proved more of a challenge. “The first six months, those artists had a lot of questions,” Schusser said.
Some groups, like the Doors, embraced the format, overhauling their entire catalog in Atmos all at once; others, like Fleetwood Mac, have proceeded more cautiously, doing one album at a time. More and more though, top legacy artists have been putting out Atmos mixes with increasing regularity, with recent releases including landmark albums like Pink Floyd’s‌ ‌“The Dark Side of the Moon‌‌” and ‌the Beach Boys’‌ ‌“Pet Sounds.”

Given the sheer volume of Atmos catalog work and the still evolving understanding of the format, not all mixes are created equal.
“The labels seem to be farming this stuff out and it isn’t always being done with the original artist or production team involved,” Clearmountain said. “I know that’s not always possible. But sometimes what comes back are just bad mixes — or strange mixes, anyway.”
Wood — who has done mixes in consultation with the original artists as well as on his own — agrees. “In general, you have to try to put the tracks into a speaker array so it doesn’t sound too jarring or gimmicky,” he said. “The goal is to feel like you’re sitting amongst these musicians as they’re performing. Like all mixing, it’s subjective, and how you approach it really depends on the music itself.”
For some artists, transforming old recordings into Atmos has been challenging. Chic recently had its first three albums mixed in the format. “The process took months and months to get right,” Rodgers said. “The team that was working on it, we gave them notes, we went into different rooms, did rough mixes to show them what we were talking about.”
For others, the overhaul has been relatively painless and even eye-opening. This past spring, Alicia Keys had eight of her albums mixed for Atmos. In a video interview promoting her catalog overhaul, Keys said that engineers working on her albums “completely reimagined every note, every sound, every instrument, every voice. It sounds like you’ve never heard it before. I mean, I never even heard it like this before. It really is a new experience.”

ONE OF THE reasons other highly touted surround sound technologies like 5.1 and 7.1 failed to catch on is because they required a specific speaker configuration. Dolby Atmos, however, is scalable and can adapt to a variety of setups.
Given its success in the headphones market, Apple has emphasized playback on its AirPods and Beats Fit Pro devices, which all offer a version of the Atmos experience with dynamic head tracking (where the sound shifts along with a user’s movement) in the $200 to $500 range. A number of other manufacturers, including Audeze, RIG, Corsair and LG, also offer Atmos headphones and earbuds.
The options for affordable home music systems, ones purpose-built for Atmos audio, have been limited. Amazon and Apple have long offered their own Atmos-enabled smart speakers, but neither really conveyed the full range of sound possible.
In March, Sonos introduced a first of its kind sub-$500 speaker, the Era 300, which more successfully packages the Atmos experience into a single compact unit, equipped with a half-dozen drivers that direct sound left, right, forward and upward.
The Grammy-winning mixing and mastering engineer Emily Lazar, who helped test and fine tune the Era 300, hopes it will be the start of tech companies bringing more viable Atmos options to market.
“No one who’s listened to Atmos in a properly tuned, beautiful-sounding studio can deny what it offers,” she said. “How now can we deliver that in a smaller package so everybody can afford it and have that same kind of experience is going to be key moving forward.”

If Atmos does ever achieve critical mass, it might come through automobiles. Most cars come equipped standard with a dozen-plus speakers, making them a natural environment for immersive audio. So far, a handful of major automakers including Mercedes-Benz and Volvo have introduced plans to put Atmos in their vehicles. It’s a market Dolby and Apple both say they are determined to expand further.
“But those kind of tech changes don’t happen in a year or two — and that’s really what it’s been so far,” Schusser said. “There’s obviously more work to be done. But we’re all optimistic we’ll get there with Atmos.”
In the meantime, recording pros like Wood will keep working and mixing, hoping the Atmos bump will last a little while longer.
“I don’t know that I could have written a better chapter for this phase of my career,” he said. “If you told me three years ago, I was going to get paid my day rate to listen and work on some of the greatest recordings in history, I would’ve said, ‘Sign me up — that sounds amazing.’”"
2023-06-22,"The first day of a weeklong hearing that could determine the outcome of Microsoft’s $70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard opened Thursday with a promise from Microsoft: If a federal judge grants an injunction that would delay the deal’s closing, Microsoft could abandon the deal altogether.
“This is going to decide whether the deal goes forward,” said Beth Wilkinson, Microsoft’s lead lawyer. She added that a loss could force the company into a “three-year administrative nightmare” that would sink the transaction, which it hopes to close by July 18.
That set the stakes for the hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where the Federal Trade Commission began laying out its case that Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision — and its popular games like Call of Duty — would be devastating for the video game industry.
The F.T.C. is asking Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a preliminary injunction, which would bar Microsoft from completing the deal before the F.T.C. had the chance to argue the case in its internal court.

The clash is broadly seen as a test of whether recent efforts to more aggressively curb the power of tech giants around the world will succeed. Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., has argued that big tech companies have vast influence over online commerce and communication, allowing them to engage in anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.
“If this deal is completed, the combined company will have and is likely to have the ability and incentive to harm competition in various markets related to consoles, subscription services and cloud,” James Weingarten, the F.T.C.’s lead lawyer, said in court on Thursday.
Mr. Weingarten said Microsoft could make Activision’s games exclusive to its Xbox console, or degrade their quality on other platforms to make the Xbox more appealing to gamers. He pointed to Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media and its slate of game studios in 2020, after which Microsoft made some of those games exclusive to Xbox. The F.T.C. pointed to an agreement made between Disney and ZeniMax to produce a game about Indiana Jones for multiple consoles. After Microsoft bought ZeniMax, the agreement was amended and the game became exclusive to Xbox. It was an indication, the F.T.C. appeared to be arguing, that Microsoft could make future Activision games exclusive to Xbox, even amending existing deals to do so.
The F.T.C. has argued that absorbing Activision’s games into Microsoft’s portfolio would also give it an unfair edge in the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation console, has been a vocal critic of the deal, and has said that PlayStation gamers could lose access to Call of Duty — an enormous franchise that has earned more than $30 billion in lifetime revenue — if Microsoft decided to make the game exclusive to Xbox. Microsoft has denied that it would do so.

Microsoft said the Activision deal would instead be good for consumers, expanding their ability to play Activision’s games through low-cost options like Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, or through the platforms of other companies like Nintendo and Nvidia, with which it has struck deals.
Ms. Wilkinson also argued that it would be nonsensical for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty and other titles from PlayStation because the company would lose out on a huge chunk of the game’s revenue. She said Sony had become the “complainer in chief” in the case, and showed an email from Sony’s chief executive, Jim Ryan, suggesting that he did not really believe Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty. Microsoft also pointed to its acquisition of Mojang, which produces Minecraft. It has continued to allow Minecraft to be available across platforms.
The F.T.C. has in another lawsuit accused Meta, Facebook’s parent company, of cutting off nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, it sued Amazon over allegations that the company tricked users into signing up for its Prime subscription service. But the F.T.C. has had setbacks: Its challenge to Meta’s purchase of a virtual reality start-up fell apart this year after a judge declined to stop the deal from closing.
The F.T.C. initially challenged Microsoft’s bid for Activision using an in-house court. But that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal. The F.T.C. asked the federal court to step in this month, saying it feared Microsoft would try to complete the deal despite the legal challenges.
The hearing in Judge Corley’s courtroom could be a decisive test for the F.T.C. If Microsoft wins, it will signal that there are weaknesses in the F.T.C. case and could cause the agency to drop its challenge to the deal. But a win for the F.T.C. would be a sign that its broader challenge has legs, and could put new pressure on Microsoft and Activision to reconsider the multibillion-dollar corporate marriage.

Though most governments around the world, including the European Union, have approved the acquisition, Microsoft was dealt a setback in April when a British regulatory authority blocked it. That decision is under appeal.
The high-profile list of witnesses expected to testify before Judge Corley over the next week includes Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision. Mr. Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, will appear via a prerecorded video deposition."

Rent it on Amazon.
In Joaquín del Paso’s new gut punch of a morality tale, a group of teenagers master machismo at an exclusive summer camp in the Mexican countryside. The true-believer counselors are devoted to training the boys to become Christian tough guys, and if that means looking the other way as the kids bully the possibly gay kid, so be it.
Not that the men aren’t watching the teens carefully because they are — through binoculars as they roughhouse shirtless. When the campers find a hole in a fence that divides them from the impoverished town outside, and one of the boys goes missing, it sets in motion a sinister force — of human, not supernatural, origin — with “Lord of the Flies”-style consequences.
Emotionally gripping and formally icy, this is horror of the uncomfortable kind, thanks to a script by del Paso and Lucy Pawlak, that’s an exercise in brutality. Take the scene in which two of the teens sense an attraction brewing, and for seconds the camp’s demented lessons in manhood disappear and tenderness takes their place. Their bliss doesn’t last long, because that would get in the way of this skin-crawling film’s expedition to excoriate toxic masculinity, religious radicalism and class and racial entitlements.

‘Pastacolypse’

Animated horror films intended for adults don’t come around often these days, so I’m stoked to shout hallelujah for this very funny, stupidly gory horror-comedy from the “Aqua Teen Hunger Force” co-creator Matthew Maiellaro.
The story is set in a “pastademic” world where gluten is banned. After being disqualified at the Global Pasta Championship for using bootleg gluten, the billionaire pasta maker Alfredo Manicotti (Dana Snyder) tracks down a hidden gluten reserve. But when he and a security guard, Al Dente Bob (William Sanderson), accidentally fall into a toxic vat of the stuff, it turns them into pasta monsters and gives Alfredo the ability to summon bow-tie demons. Drunk on power and blind to the needs of his spoiled daughter, Emma (Lauren Holt), Alfred sets out to install a “newdle world order” where gluten reigns.
That paragraph barely scratches the surface of the cuckoo course this witty, boisterously animated (and free!) film takes. Snyder and Sanderson have stellar comic timing, and their performances elevate the potty-punny humor to whip-smart levels. Sorry, but not sorry: This movie will mac you smile.

Newt (Timothy Morton) and his wife, Ollie (Audra Todd), show up one day at a small church in 1930s Kentucky to ask James (Ted Ferguson), the cranky old pastor, to bless the house they just moved into, claiming it’s inhabited by a dark spirit. James begrudgingly agrees, but on his first attempt all he finds is a ramshackle house and a dead raccoon. But when James returns, he faces an evil entity that makes him question who, exactly, is the real monster in the house.
If it’s haunted house mayhem you want, see “The Boogeyman”; this film walks in the opposite direction. The writer-director Dane Sears delivers a tender but chilling parable about the consequences of unexamined grief and loss; he’s as confident keeping his camera still for long stretches to let darkness do its thing, even if his actors are often too pitched or muted, as he is racing it around. Some horror fans may find the film too spare to be scary, but I savored its austere unfussiness. The real star is the landscape of rural Bourbon County, Ky., where Sears was raised and where he shot parts of his film.

As Jessica wanders the darkened hallways and keeps an eye on the deranged man she locked up in a holding cell, she discovers she’s not alone in a place that may itself be under Malum’s sinister supernatural spell.

According to its production notes, Anthony DiBlasi’s movie is an “expanded reimagining” of “Last Shift” (2014), his smaller and scrappier (and to me, superior) film. This version is a similar and equally intense fever dream that reminded me of the terrifying where-are-we mysteries of “The Void.” It’s good-looking too, thanks to Sean McDaniel’s menacing cinematography and Russell FX’s extra-gory makeup effects. Hats off to DiBlasi and his co-writer, Scott Poiley, for being so ambitious with genre; they serve cultism, occultism, a monster, a ghost, comedy, sci-fi and family drama. By the end of the film I was stuffed, but horror fans with more maximalist tastes will be satiated.
‘Creepypasta’
Stream it on Screambox.
Creepypasta, for those unfamiliar with the term, describes online horror stories that depict uncanny nightmare realms; some go viral, like Momo and Slender Man.
This entertaining anthology compiles 10 creepypasta fictions from eight directors folded into a framing device about a man who finds a mysterious thumb drive in a house of horrors. The films vary in polish, fright and budget, but they’re generally eerie and all short, in some cases just a few minutes long — a nice departure from some of the bloatedness in the “V/H/S” franchise.
My favorite is Tony Morales’s “BEC,” a macabre meditation on mortality. Filmed in blue-tinted black and white (and told in Spanish), it’s about an older woman who wanders her home with her mouth covered in a filthy CPAP mask as a record player plays a warped rendition of “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” You don’t need me to tell you that a wolf isn’t what she should be afraid of."
2023-06-24,"The tragic deaths of five people on a tour to see the Titanic shipwreck this week have put the risks of extreme travel into focus. But despite the dangers, travel to out-there locations like the South Pole, remote mountaintops, shark-infested waters and space is becoming more popular.
Adventure tourism is expected to bring in more than $1 trillion of revenue globally by 2030, up from an expected $316.6 billion in 2022, according to the market research firm Grand View Research.
And as interest grows, so, too, will the number of search and rescue missions, says Mikki Hastings, president of the National Association for Search and Rescue. “Whether it’s space or Everest, every person deserves to be found,” she said.
The number of businesses aiming to mitigate the danger and potential emergency costs of extreme travel are starting to rise. Some offer rescue and medical evacuation from remote locations. Others are working out new types of insurance policies for pursuits like space travel.

Traditional travel insurance won’t swoop in with paramedics, even though it typically covers the cost of an emergency. Dan Richards, the chief executive of Global Rescue, told DealBook that he wanted to fill that gap when he founded  the emergency travel management company in 2004. For a $360 annual fee, it provides members with evacuation services. Upgrades, including one that promises “military special operations veterans” will retrieve you from dangerous locations like war zones, can raise the fee to about $1,800. Similarly, Medjet, a medical evacuation service, sells annual memberships, and companies like AirMed International, SkyMed and others offer emergency extractions.
Travel insurance is going to space. With companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic selling tickets for trips, the market for space tourism is expected to grow to about $3 billion by 2030, according to estimates from UBS. The space travel insurance market is still small, but Lloyd’s of London, which insures space businesses, began underwriting space travel insurance in 2021, and last year the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance said they would jointly develop space insurance offerings.
Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for some rescues. The cost of search and rescue typically falls on state and local agencies, Ms. Hastings said. About a half-dozen states have laws that allow agencies to charge a rescue recipient, though few do, and there is no cost to those rescued by the federal park services, for example. Last year, lawmakers from Hawaii and Utah introduced legislation to allocate federal funds to help states pay for search and rescue operations, a burden that the drafters said disproportionately fell on less populous places, but the bill failed to gain traction.
The search for the submersible this week most likely cost millions of dollars. The Coast Guard, which led the rescue effort, has jurisdiction over search and rescue in navigable waters in the United States and beyond. “But that’s just the definition of their mission,” Ms. Hastings argues. “We don’t encourage charging for search and rescue because we want people to seek help regardless of socioeconomic status.”
Mr. Richards said a client of Global Rescue had signed up for the Titan trip this week, but withdrew his deposit because of safety concerns. Though his team would have worked with international rescuers if the customer had followed through with his plans, the company would not have had the requisite deep sea capabilities. There are some journeys where risk can’t really be mitigated yet, he said, adding, “If there’s an emergency in space, no one will be able to necessarily reach people.” — Ephrat Livni

India’s soft power secret
An all-star team from corporate America was in Washington this week for the state visit of India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. And the high number of Indian-American chief executives involved was a demonstration of how the country’s diaspora has found a unique place at the nexus of business and political power — and helped boost the country’s image.

The White House dinner was a roll call of top talent. The invite list included the Microsoft chief Satya Nadella; Sundar Pichai, the boss of Alphabet; Arvind Krishna, the head of IBM; the Micron chief Sanjay Mehrotra; and Netflix’s chief content officer, Bela Bajaria. Alongside the business leaders were a number of senior government officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was from South India.
Mr. Modi has made tapping into the diaspora a priority. He has held two huge stadium rallies in the United States since becoming prime minister in 2014 — at Madison Square Garden that year and the NRG Stadium in Houston in 2019 — and another in Australia last month. Still, his politics are controversial, and he has been blamed for stoking sectarian violence; in 2005, he was denied a visa to enter the United States when he was chief minister of Gujarat State.
But even if views on Mr. Modi are mixed, the view of India is largely positive. A Pew Research Center survey found 37 percent of Indian Americans had little or no confidence in Mr. Modi compared with 21 percent who did. But more than half of Indian Americans have a more positive view of the country.
Targeting the diaspora is an astute move. Indians are the second biggest immigrant group in the United States and seen as a success story. They have a median household income of almost $150,000 a year, the highest of any immigrant groups, and account for a majority of H-1B visas for highly-skilled workers. They also maintain strong links to India, through remittances that surpassed $100 billion in 2022, and contacts, cross-border trade and investment.
And their success is a useful form of soft power. Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term, told The Economist that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist politics pose a risk to India’s reputation, but “if you have people in diaspora who are successful and create a positive image of the country from which they came, that helps their native country.”

SoftBank
SoftBank is known for big moves like introducing the iPhone in Japan and its outsized, and not always successful, bets on start-ups. But its founder, Masa Son, is also famous for his excitable, elaborate and, sometimes, unusual presentations.
His colorful style has been missed in the past year as the chief executive laid low amid the conglomerate’s struggling performance. But this week, Mr. Son returned to the public stage at SoftBank’s annual shareholder meeting with a new slide deck.
His presentation featured slides that asked big questions — including “What is Mankind?” — and the billionaire’s story of how he brainstormed investment ideas with ChatGPT at 4 a.m.
Still, to longtime Mr. Son watchers, it’s tough to compete with his previous presentations, which were just as memorably offbeat and unabashedly grandiose. (Son relies on a half-dozen young SoftBank employees to draft his presentations, with his direct input, according to Bloomberg.)
Here are some of DealBook’s favorites from over the years:
Mr. Son depicted SoftBank as “producer of golden eggs,” whose shiny-shelled progeny included investments in Uber, the chip designer Arm and more.
The “valley of coronavirus,” a classic, shows SoftBank’s winged unicorns — that is, the herd of start-ups it has invested in — flying over the economic trough carved out by Covid-19.
Mr. Son explained SoftBank offers “vision capital,” not venture capital. Here, Mr. Son also predicted that A.I. would grow companies’ market caps so much that those numbers … simply couldn’t be charted.
SoftBank predicted a sharp rebound in WeWork’s fortunes, including one of the most hopeful-seeming earnings charts in recent memory.
Mr. Son used pictures of tofu to illustrate SoftBank’s profits. (A footnote explains the analogy.)

Publishers Clearing House, the direct marketing company that uses sweepstakes to sell magazine subscriptions, agreed on Monday to pay $18.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission, which accused the company of using what’s known as dark patterns to trick customers into paying for products or giving up their data.
The company coerced customers through false suggestions that making a purchase was the only way to enter its popular sweepstakes or that doing so would increase their chances of winning, the complaint says. The company is also accused of charging customers hidden fees during purchases, sending deceptive marketing emails and misleading customers about how their data was being used.
Many of the customers who fell victim to these tactics are older and have lower incomes, according to the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On top of paying $18.5 million, which the F.T.C. said it would use to refund customers, the company agreed to adjust its interface to prevent more confusion.
Publishers Clearing House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

As more commerce moves online, dark patterns, which use deceptive design to dupe consumers, are becoming increasingly common, the F.T.C. said in a report released in September.
A common dark pattern is when a company makes it difficult to cancel a subscription or purchase by steering customers away from that option. For example, when companies offer free trials but hide the cancellation button deep in the account settings.
In other cases, a company could present its privacy settings in a way that persuades customers to release the most amount of personal information without their informed consent. The F.T.C. accused Publishers Clearing House of doing this before January 2019 by telling customers that it did not share customer data with third parties when it had.
Publishers Clearing House is also accused of sending deceptive marketing emails — another common dark pattern — with subject lines like “High Priority Doc. W-34 Issued” that led customers to believe they needed to address outstanding tax forms while the content of the email was unrelated marketing content.
Background: Amazon has been accused of similar practices.
The F.T.C. sued Amazon on Wednesday over similar dark patterns that the regulator said illegally coerced consumers into signing up for the tech giant’s Prime service and prevented them from easily canceling the subscription. Amazon denied that its website interface broke the law.
That lawsuit is the first one the F.T.C. has filed against Amazon under the leadership of Lina Khan, who has long been critical of Amazon’s market power.
“Firms that continue to deploy deceptive design techniques are on notice,” Samuel Levine, who leads the F.T.C.’s consumer protection branch, said in a statement."

The song defining Pride month this year is Kylie Minogue’s “Padam Padam,” a thumping tease that’s lightly campy and has taken on outsize importance as a gay nightlife anthem and meme-culture staple.
For Minogue, 55 — a bona fide superstar abroad but more of a pop curio here — it’s one of a handful of breakthrough moments that have cemented her embrace among gay listeners. But “Padam Padam” is also part of a longer list of diva anthems — from Lady Gaga, Madonna, and many others — that become, in effect, gay canon.
On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about “Padam Padam” and how songs get inscribed into the gay pop canon, Minogue’s not-quite-stardom in the United States, and how a younger generation of pop aspirants like Rina Sawayama and Charli XCX perform their embrace of their gay fans.

2023-06-28,"The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. Each month, we’ll choose three nonfiction films — classics, overlooked recent docs and more — that will reward your time.
‘The Mystery of Picasso’ (1956)
Stream it on the Criterion Channel, Kanopy, Metrograph and Ovid. Rent it on Apple TV, Google Play, Kino Now, Milestone and Vudu.
Henri-Georges Clouzot’s documentary begins with the proposition that cinema can offer a glimpse into the “secret mechanism” that guides a creator — that it’s feasible, at least with painting, if not with music or poetry, to observe the artistic process as it occurs, to begin to understand what is happening in an artist’s head. To that end, the filmmaker has a shirtless Pablo Picasso engage in a marathon painting and drawing session for the camera. For the majority of the movie, we see only Picasso’s artwork, which fills the frame. Around the half-hour mark, Clouzot reveals how he has achieved this effect: Sitting on the other side of a page from the camera, Picasso is filling sheet after sheet of see-through paper. What the film captures are mirror images of whatever he is sketching.
Picasso says that he could paint all night. When, immediately after that remark, Clouzot informs him that the cinematographer has only five minutes of film left, Picasso replies, “It’ll do,” and proceeds to create what looks like a fish that morphs into a rooster that turns into a faintly feline inkblot face. To see Picasso improvise and revise is to want to shout, “Stop!” whenever the composition begins to look interesting, which is almost always immediately — and then to see the error of wanting to arrest his inspiration. The artworks change radically once he begins adding color and filling in the backgrounds, a progression that reveals a complexity barely hinted at in the initial drafting. The process isn’t necessarily shown in real time — editing speeds up hours into minutes (and makes Picasso’s revisions look faintly like animation). A score by Georges Auric that incorporates elements of classical and jazz gives the movie an appealing rhythm.
For the finale, Picasso tells Clouzot that he wants to work on something more ambitious, and, after he fusses with the face and coloring of a goat, the film switches to CinemaScope and watches as the painter toys with the facial expressions and abdominal contours of a nude woman, among other sights. The secret mechanism undergirding Picasso’s creativity remains a mystery by the movie’s end, but watching his handiwork is still enthralling.

‘Room 237’ (2013)
Stream it on Tubi and Pluto.
Forget Picasso. Is it possible to get inside Stanley Kubrick’s head? Rodney Ascher’s documentary dives deeply into various fan theories surrounding Kubrick’s “The Shining” (1980). Kubrick’s reputation for total control means that absolutely nothing in his movies should be regarded as accidental (even if it is), and “The Shining” opened near the start of a revolution in film watching. Home video suddenly made it possible for obsessives to pore over every image with relative ease.
The theorists themselves narrate, and Ascher, who did his own editing, creates a vortex-like atmosphere that makes it hard not to get hooked on what they’re saying, no matter how ludicrous. They have some persuasive ideas: Passages suggesting that Kubrick conceived the film as an allegory for genocide — filling it with allusions to the Holocaust and to the slaughter of Native Americans — are convincing. Fans invested in the Minotaur and labyrinth imagery, or who attempt to map the floor plan of the Overlook Hotel, or who discover strange connections when they play the movie overlaid backward and forward simultaneously, have at least done interesting spadework. And still other notions here — like the conspiracy theory that the moon-landing footage was faked with Kubrick’s help, and that “The Shining” was his attempt to reveal it to the public — are the sort of pernicious idiocy that ought to be confined to the most obscure pockets of Reddit. (The movie opens with a long legal disclaimer stating that none of the views in it reflect those of Kubrick or the other “Shining” filmmakers.)

That Ascher’s subsequent paranoia-thons (“The Nightmare,” “A Glitch in the Matrix”) have gotten mired in that sort of speciousness suggests he hasn’t yet found another subject as rich or complex as Kubrick. But while “Room 237” may piggyback off another filmmaker’s genius, it proves yet again that “The Shining” is an endlessly fun puzzle to solve.
‘Three Minutes: A Lengthening’ (2022)
Stream it on Hulu and Kanopy. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.
Bianca Stigter’s documentary takes a close reading of a very different sort of film. It centers on three minutes of footage shot in August 1938 by David Kurtz, who had arrived in the United States when he was 4, but was that summer back in Europe touring the continent. He shot those three minutes of footage in his hometown, Nasielsk, Poland, where, according to the documentary, fewer than 100 of the 3,000 Jewish residents would survive the Holocaust.
Stigter, whose book “Atlas of an Occupied City (Amsterdam 1940-1945)” served as the basis for a recent, Cannes-premiered documentary from her husband, the director Steve McQueen, shows the three minutes in full at the beginning and then spends the rest of “A Lengthening” examining them in minute detail, sometimes frame by frame. Taking cues from a book by Glenn Kurtz, David Kurtz’s grandson, who elaborates in voice-over, the documentary explains how the location and even some of the people in the footage were identified. (Eleven, to be precise — out of more than 150 people in the footage. Stigter at one point arrays all the subjects’ faces in a mosaic.)
Maurice Chandler, of the two people in the footage whom Glenn Kurtz was able to locate still living, says that cameras like David Kurtz’s were rare, which explains why different social groups in the town that rarely mingled had all clamored to greet him. Every element of every image of the footage, from the clothes that women are wearing to the shadows on buildings to the shapes of out-of-focus letters, offers a potential clue. Stigter, whose perspective is voiced by the narrator, Helena Bonham Carter, is also concerned with just how much the images leave unseen. During testimony about the December 1939 roundup of Jews in Nasielsk, she slowly zooms in on a frozen image of the calm town square where it happened. Glenn Kurtz says that most contemporary viewers of the footage see it differently from how survivors do, because survivors can see what’s beyond the frame."
2023-06-29,"The Supreme Court broadened protections on Thursday for religious workers in a case that involved a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service who refused to work on his Sabbath.
In a unanimous decision, the justices rejected a test that had long been used to determine what accommodations an employer must make for religious workers, but declined to rule on the merits of the case, sending it back to a lower court to consider under a new standard.
Writing for the court, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that the case gave it the “first opportunity in nearly 50 years” to explain the nuances of how workplaces must adapt to religious requests by employees.
For an employer to deny an employee’s request for a religious accommodation, Justice Alito wrote, it “must show that the burden of granting an accommodation would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business.”

The decision could affect countless workplaces and could require many employers to make substantial changes to accommodate religious workers.
The ruling is the latest in a series by the court that have focused on expanding the role of religion in public life, sometimes at the expense of other values, like gay rights and access to contraception.
In the past few years, the Supreme Court has ruled that a high school football coach had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after his team’s games, that state programs supporting private schools in Maine and Montana must include religious ones, that a Catholic social services agency in Philadelphia could defy city rules and refuse to work with same-sex couples who apply to take in foster children and that the Trump administration could allow employers with religious objections to deny contraception coverage to female workers.
The latest decision may be less divisive than some of the court’s recent rulings on religion, in part because protecting observance of the Sabbath may not split Americans along the usual lines. Indeed, liberal justices have tried in the past to shield workers from discipline and termination for following their faith, and all three on the court signed onto the decision.
The case was brought by Gerald Groff, an evangelical Christian and former missionary who worked as a substitute mail carrier. After the Postal Service made a deal with Amazon in 2013 to deliver packages on Sundays, Mr. Groff said he had to choose between his faith and his livelihood, opting to quit after being disciplined for missing work.

“I felt that I had a decision between what the post office wanted and what God wanted of me,” Mr. Groff said in an interview on Thursday. “I hope that this is inspiring to people because in America we do have these freedoms and they’re protected.”

“I try to make the Supreme Court accessible to readers. I strive to distill and translate complex legal materials into accessible prose, while presenting fairly the arguments of both sides and remaining alert to the political context and practical consequences of the court’s work.”
Learn about how Adam Liptak approaches covering the court.
The Postal Service said in a statement that it was confident that it would prevail once the lower court reconsidered the case.
Mr. Groff was represented by First Liberty Institute, which describes itself as the largest legal organization in the nation focused exclusively on defending religious freedom.
Kelly Shackelford, the president and chief counsel of First Liberty, welcomed the ruling, saying that it restored “religious freedom to every American in the workplace.”
“This decision will positively help millions and millions of Americans — those who work now and their children and grandchildren,” he said.

American Atheists, which advocates secularism in governmental policies and which submitted an amicus brief in support of the Postal Service in the case, Groff v. DeJoy, No. 22-174, said the ruling continued a worrying trend.
“While today’s decision doesn’t give religious employees carte blanche in the workplace, it certainly continues this court’s recent practice of expanding loopholes, accommodations and ‘rights’ for the religious while shifting more burdens onto atheists, humanists and the nonreligious,” said Geoffrey T. Blackwell, litigation counsel for the group.
Mr. Groff had sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that requires employers to “reasonably accommodate” workers’ religious practice so long as they can do so “without undue hardship” to the company’s business.
A 1977 precedent, Trans World Airlines v. Hardison, stood in his way. That decision said that employers need not accommodate workers if the effort imposed more than a trifling, or “de minimis,” burden on their businesses.
Lawyers for the Postal Service argued that Mr. Groff’s refusal to work on Sundays imposed a significant burden on a small post office, was in tension with an agreement with a labor union and was bad for other workers’ morale.

Lower courts ruled against Mr. Groff. Judge Patty Shwartz, writing for a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, said that “exempting Groff from working on Sundays caused more than a de minimis cost on U.S.P.S. because it actually imposed on his co-workers, disrupted the workplace and work flow, and diminished employee morale.”
In dissent, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman wrote that “the majority renders any burden on employees sufficient to establish undue hardship, effectively subjecting Title VII religious accommodation to a heckler’s veto by disgruntled employees.”"
2023-06-30,"CROOKED PLOW (Verso, 276 pp., paperback, $19.95), by the Afro-Brazilian author Itamar Vieira Junior (and translated by Johnny Lorenz), offers a salt-of-the-earth paean to a land where “the blood of history flows like a river.” Life is hard on the Água Negra plantation in northeastern Brazil in the mid-20th century — an endless cycle of drought and floods, the shadows of slavery still hanging heavily on the tenant farmers who eke out an existence. “Suffering was the secret blood running through the veins of Água Negra,” we’re told.

How to break this pattern of squalor and oppression? For Bibiana and Belonísia, two sisters growing up in a family of spiritual healers, different paths emerge. Bibiana will marry Severo, a union organizer “born from the earth,” and move away. Belonísia — who tragically severs her tongue as a young girl with her grandmother’s knife — will remain, a mute witness to her community’s struggles and dreams over the following decades.
One balm for Belonísia will be her faith, a syncretist religion rooted in African spirits, or encantados. Her father, Zeca, in fact, channels the encantados to treat “maladies of the divided spirit — people who had somehow lost their stories, lost their memories, people separated from themselves.”
Bibiana and Belonísia will each get to tell their versions of Água Negra’s story — and so will an encantado itself. And despite the harshness of their lives, there’s a sign of hope: Bibiana and Severo eventually return to help usher in a new era of workers’ consciousness. Even if his book plods at times, Vieira provides a compelling vision of history’s downtrodden and neglected.

Carlos Fonseca, born in Costa Rica and named one of Granta’s Best Young Spanish Language Novelists in 2021, writes novels that are elaborate puzzles, with stories embedded in stories. In AUSTRAL (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 207 pp., $27), translated by Megan McDowell, he has created a multilayered exploration of ideas of belonging, language and erasure that moves from a snowy Ohio campus to the Amazonian jungle and northern Argentine desert.

Julio Gamboa is a literature professor who left Central America as a teenager to pursue an education in the United States. Now, in middle age, he finds himself adrift in a shaky marriage and far from home, “losing his language, and the last traces of his past along with it.” But the past is never far behind; soon he is summoned to Argentina to help edit the unfinished manuscript of a long-lost friend, the novelist Aliza Abravanel, who has died after a protracted illness.

But what, exactly, is her final work — and which parts are fiction and which are memoir? “Austral” is full of tales of cultural collisions and trauma, from the failed New Germany colony in the Amazon to a theater project in Guatemala that attempts to excavate traces of the country’s genocide through the testimony of survivors. There are recurring motifs: silent witnesses, madness and loss, private languages and solitary landscapes. The more Julio immerses himself in Aliza’s enigmatic text, the more a tapestry of connections is revealed. “Austral” is a masterly voyage of discovery, both physical and intellectual.
Laura, the narrator of Guadalupe Nettel’s STILL BORN (Bloomsbury, 207 pp., $26.99), is in her mid-30s and completing a Ph.D in literature — or trying to — while balancing other complicating factors: a strained relationship with her mother, noisy neighbors (a single mother and her tantrum-prone son), Mexico City’s rampant sexism and her dormant romantic life.
Actually, long ago she chose a path of independence and solitude over the more conventional route of marriage and motherhood. And she’s not shy in saying so. “For years I tried to convince my girlfriends that procreating was a hopeless mistake,” she explains. “I told them that children, no matter how sweet and loving they were in their best moments, would always represent a limit on their freedom, an economic burden, not to mention the physical and emotional cost they bring about.”
When her best friend, Alina, becomes pregnant — and then gets a devastating prognosis about her baby’s chance of survival — Laura begins to rethink her assumptions, not to mention life’s other essential mysteries. (She has studied Buddhism.) How do you understand an infant’s will to exist or a parent’s sense of attachment? How does one learn to live each day when it may be a loved one’s last?

Nettel, whose earlier work has at times veered toward the phantasmagoric, is all the more haunting here for her vivid realism. “Still Born,” translated by Rosalind Harvey, is a heart-racingly intense journey, for Laura as much as Alina. “Motherhood changes one’s existence forever,” Laura observes, in ways she never could have imagined.
“What does it mean to be happy?” asks Norman Erikson Pasaribu, a young Toba Batak writer, at the outset of his debut collection, HAPPY STORIES, MOSTLY (Feminist Press, 146 pp., paperback, $16.95), translated by Tiffany Tsao. It’s a difficult question, especially for many of his gay characters searching for connections. In modern-day Indonesia, they find little joy, let alone solace or acceptance.
Pasaribu’s motifs run much darker than Fonseca’s: His stories abound in heavy rain, weepy mothers, confessions and crucifixes, loneliness and suicide. Dreams go unfulfilled and the young, like their country, are often unsure which way to turn.
“If you ask me, is any nation — especially a postcolonial one — ever not at a crossroads?” asks one character in “Welcome to the Department of Unanswered Prayers.” “Even more so if you’re poor. Like I used to be. I was at a crossroads and a dead end all at once, every single day of my life.”

Even when Pasaribu imagines the future, as in “Metaxu: Jakarta, 2038,” things look bleak: a dystopian world of flying cars, karaoke bars and erased memories. Pasaribu’s stories vary widely, mixing realism and fabulism, but frequently return to an emptiness at the core. They are far from happy. Pasaribu, like the short-story writer in “A Bedtime Story for Your Long Sleep,” has nevertheless found a way to construct something new out of tales of loss: “I felt that such a story would prove useful someday — a bottomless pit of sorrow-bricks for me to mine, to build my Babel Tower of misery.”

2023-07-01,"The latest turn of the conference realignment carousel driven by college football took me back to the Pleistocene period of journalism, when I worked as a summer news desk clerk amid the telex machines, pneumatic tubes and desk drawers full of booze at the dearly departed Los Angeles Herald Examiner.
A sign on an editor’s desk caught my eye: “Deadline is a two-syllable word.” Succinct and sly, it mocked one of the newsroom’s most sacrosanct tenets: Don’t blow deadline.
But in the digital era of continuous publishing, the notion of a deadline — which melds two of Merriam-Webster’s more unequivocal words — has somehow become malleable, a transformation that brings me back to the recent maneuverings of San Diego State University.
If the school was going to leave the Mountain West Conference for the Pac-12 in a year, it faced an 11 p.m. Pacific Time deadline on Friday to notify the Mountain West. Otherwise, its exit fee would double to about $36 million.

The problem: San Diego State did not have an offer from the Pac-12 Conference.
The reason: The Pac-12 did not have a media rights deal. (More on that in a moment.)
As the hourglass emptied on Friday, the Pac-12 chancellors and presidents convened to receive another one of their regular updates on the media rights negotiations. Later, San Diego State informed the Mountain West that it would stay put. For now.
That this unfolded on June 30 was fitting.
Last year on that date, Southern California and U.C.L.A., the Pac-12’s football and basketball standard-bearers, stunned the college athletics world by deciding to bolt for the Big Ten when the Pac-12’s television contract expires after the 2023-24 season.
This opened the door of opportunity for San Diego State, which has long pined for a move to the Pac-12 — a switch that would not only confer athletics legitimacy, but also put a California State University school on equal footing with Cal-Berkeley, a flagship school in the more prestigious University of California system.

It would require a three-step process. First, the Pac-12 would secure a media rights deal. Next, the 10 remaining members (the Pac-12 hoped) would sign a grant of rights, binding them to the conference for the duration of the media rights agreement. And finally, the conference would consider expansion.

Yet a year later, the Pac-12 is still in first gear.
The Pac-12, whose current agreement with ESPN and Fox expires after this season, found itself boxed out of several options when the Big 12 surprisingly locked in its media deal with Fox and ESPN last October, two months after the Big Ten announced its deal with Fox, CBS and NBC. The Southeastern Conference’s 10-year contract with ESPN kicks in next year, and the Atlantic Coast Conference’s deal with ESPN runs until 2036.
That leaves few openings on the broadcast schedule to showcase the Pac-12.
“The problem for the Pac-12 is all the other cards have now been dealt,” said Ed Desser, a sports media rights consultant, who noted that the only coveted spot would be Saturday night on ESPN or Friday night on ESPN, Fox, Apple or Amazon.
Negotiations have sputtered for several reasons.
First, the Pac-12 commissioner, George Kliavkoff, tried to persuade the University of California Board of Regents last fall to keep U.C.L.A. from leaving, which would have given the conference the valuable Los Angeles media market to shop around. (In December, the governing board voted not to block the move.)
Also last fall, many media companies began slashing jobs nearly across the board, particularly at Disney, which owns ESPN and said it would shed 7,000 jobs as it dealt with the continuing impact of cord cutting. And while streaming platforms like Apple and Amazon might be attractive, those companies are unlikely to view sports programming (that is not the N.F.L.) as indispensable.

It quickly became apparent that the media industry’s belt-tightening would manifest itself in second-tier rights deals. Shortly after the Big 12’s deal, which was largely considered below-market at $31.7 million per school, the Pac-12 adjusted downward by 10 percent estimates of an agreement it could reach if U.C.L.A. remained.
Then came the delays.
Expectations of an agreement by the start of the Pac-12 men’s basketball tournament led to hopes of a deal by the Final Four. And then by mid-April. And then surely by the start of summer. Now, the assumption is that an announcement will be made before the Pac-12’s football media day on July 21, so that the event’s dominant story line is actually football.
Of course, what is in the agreement will have consequences.
The Big 12, which added Brigham Young, Cincinnati, Central Florida and Houston on Saturday, and could lose Texas and Oklahoma this time next year, is interested in poaching any Pac-12 school that is unhappy enough to jump if the payout is significantly below what the Big 12 is receiving.
In that case, it would not take much — Colorado and Arizona leaving, perhaps, or Utah — for the Pac-12 to disintegrate.
These are the scenarios that San Diego State had to game out. The Aztecs, who came within one final push of winning a men’s basketball championship and who regularly exhibit a quietly competent football team, are in a familiar spot. They agreed in 2011 to jump to the Big East for football, while playing in the Big West for other sports. But two years later, that agreement collapsed and they remained in the Mountain West.

Last month, the San Diego State president, Adela de la Torre, wrote a letter to the Mountain West saying the school intended to leave and asking for more time. A flurry of back-and-forth letters ensued.
In the end, San Diego State determined that its conference exit may well be negotiable, as many before it have been. And so the school concluded that if a move to the Pac-12 were to happen, it would happen in time — deadlines be damned."
2023-07-02,"In the collection of the Getty museum in Los Angeles is a portrait from the 17th century of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid: disheveled, holding up sheets of “Elements,” his treatise on geometry, with grimy hands.
For more than 2,000 years, Euclid’s text was the paradigm of mathematical argumentation and reasoning. “Euclid famously starts with ‘definitions’ that are almost poetic,” Jeremy Avigad, a logician at Carnegie Mellon University, said in an email. “He then built the mathematics of the time on top of that, proving things in such a way that each successive step ‘clearly follows’ from previous ones, using the basic notions, definitions and prior theorems.” There were complaints that some of Euclid’s “obvious” steps were less than obvious, Dr. Avigad said, yet the system worked.
But by the 20th century, mathematicians were no longer willing to ground mathematics in this intuitive geometric foundation. Instead they developed formal systems — precise symbolic representations, mechanical rules. Eventually, this formalization allowed mathematics to be translated into computer code. In 1976, the four-color theorem — which states that four colors are sufficient to fill a map so that no two adjacent regions are the same color — became the first major theorem proved with the help of computational brute force.
Now mathematicians are grappling with the latest transformative force: artificial intelligence.
In 2019, Christian Szegedy, a computer scientist formerly at Google and now at a start-up in the Bay Area, predicted that a computer system would match or exceed the problem-solving ability of the best human mathematicians within a decade. Last year he revised the target date to 2026.

Akshay Venkatesh, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and a winner of the Fields Medal in 2018, isn’t currently interested in using A.I., but he is keen on talking about it. “I want my students to realize that the field they’re in is going to change a lot,” he said in an interview last year. He recently added by email: “I am not opposed to thoughtful and deliberate use of technology to support our human understanding. But I strongly believe that mindfulness about the way we use it is essential.”
In February, Dr. Avigad attended a workshop about “machine-assisted proofs” at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. (He visited the Euclid portrait on the final day of the workshop.) The gathering drew an atypical mix of mathematicians and computer scientists. “It feels consequential,” said Terence Tao, a mathematician at the university, winner of a Fields Medal in 2006 and the workshop’s lead organizer.

Dr. Tao noted that only in the last couple years have mathematicians started worrying about A.I.’s potential threats, whether to mathematical aesthetics or to themselves. That prominent community members are now broaching the issues and exploring the potential “kind of breaks the taboo,” he said.
One conspicuous workshop attendee sat in the front row: a trapezoidal box named “raise-hand robot” that emitted a mechanical murmur and lifted its hand whenever an online participant had a question. “It helps if robots are cute and nonthreatening,” Dr. Tao said.

Bring on the “proof whiners”
These days there is no shortage of gadgetry for optimizing our lives — diet, sleep, exercise. “We like to attach stuff to ourselves to make it a little easier to get things right,” Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said during a workshop break. A.I. gadgetry might do the same for mathematics, he added: “It’s very clear that the question is, What can machines do for us, not what will machines do to us.”
One math gadget is called a proof assistant, or interactive theorem prover. (“Automath” was an early incarnation in the 1960s.) Step-by-step, a mathematician translates a proof into code; then a software program checks whether the reasoning is correct. Verifications accumulate in a library, a dynamic canonical reference that others can consult. This type of formalization provides a foundation for mathematics today, said Dr. Avigad, who is the director of the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics (funded by the crypto entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson), “in just the same way that Euclid was trying to codify and provide a foundation for the mathematics of his time.”
Of late, the open-source proof assistant system Lean is attracting attention. Developed at Microsoft by Leonardo de Moura, a computer scientist now with Amazon, Lean uses automated reasoning, which is powered by what is known as good old-fashioned artificial intelligence, or GOFAI — symbolic A.I., inspired by logic. So far the Lean community has verified an intriguing theorem about turning a sphere inside out as well as a pivotal theorem in a scheme for unifying mathematical realms, among other gambits.

But a proof assistant also has drawbacks: It often complains that it does not understand the definitions, axioms or reasoning steps entered by the mathematician, and for this it has been called a “proof whiner.” All that whining can make research cumbersome. But Heather Macbeth, a mathematician at Fordham University, said that this same feature — providing line-by-line feedback — also makes the systems useful for teaching.

In the spring, Dr. Macbeth designed a “bilingual” course: She translated every problem presented on the blackboard into Lean code in the lecture notes, and students submitted solutions to homework problems both in Lean and prose. “It gave them confidence,” Dr. Macbeth said, because they received instant feedback on when the proof was finished and whether each step along the way was right or wrong.
Since attending the workshop, Emily Riehl, a mathematician at Johns Hopkins University, used an experimental proof-assistant program to formalize proofs she had previously published with a co-author. By the end of a verification, she said, “I’m really, really deep into understanding the proof, way deeper than I’ve ever understood before. I’m thinking so clearly that I can explain it to a really dumb computer.”
Brute reason — but is it math?
Another automated-reasoning tool, used by Marijn Heule, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and an Amazon scholar, is what he colloquially calls “brute reasoning” (or, more technically, a Satisfiability, or SAT, solver). By merely stating, with a carefully crafted encoding, which “exotic object” you want to find, he said, a supercomputer network churns through a search space and determines whether or not that entity exists.
Just before the workshop, Dr. Heule and one of his Ph.D. students, Bernardo Subercaseaux, finalized their solution to a longstanding problem with a file that was 50 terabytes in size. Yet that file hardly compared with a result that Dr. Heule and collaborators produced in 2016: “Two-hundred-terabyte maths proof is largest ever,” a headline in Nature announced. The article went on to ask whether solving problems with such tools truly counted as math. In Dr. Heule’s view, this approach is needed “to solve problems that are beyond what humans can do.”

Another set of tools uses machine learning, which synthesizes oodles of data and detects patterns but is not good at logical, step-by-step reasoning. Google’s DeepMind designs machine-learning algorithms to tackle the likes of protein folding (AlphaFold) and winning at chess (AlphaZero). In a 2021 Nature paper, a team described their results as “advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with A.I.”

Yuhuai “Tony” Wu, a computer scientist formerly at Google and now with a start-up in the Bay Area, has outlined a grander machine-learning goal: to “solve mathematics.” At Google, Dr. Wu explored how the large language models that empower chatbots might help with mathematics. The team used a model that was trained on internet data and then fine-tuned on a large math-rich data set, using, for instance, an online archive of math and science papers. When asked in everyday English to solve math problems, this specialized chatbot, named Minerva, was “pretty good at imitating humans,” Dr. Wu said at the workshop. The model obtained scores that were better than an average 16-year-old student on high school math exams.
Ultimately, Dr. Wu said, he envisioned an “automated mathematician” that has “the capability of solving a mathematical theorem all by itself.”
Mathematics as a litmus test
Mathematicians have responded to these disruptions with varying levels of concern.
Michael Harris, at Columbia University, expresses qualms in his “Silicon Reckoner” Substack. He is troubled by the potentially conflicting goals and values of research mathematics and the tech and defense industries. In a recent newsletter, he noted that one speaker at a workshop, “A.I. to Assist Mathematical Reasoning,” organized by the National Academies of Sciences, was a representative from Booz Allen Hamilton, a government contractor for intelligence agencies and the military.

Dr. Harris lamented the lack of discussion about the larger implications of A.I. on mathematical research, particularly “when contrasted with the very lively conversation going on” about the technology “pretty much everywhere except mathematics.”
Geordie Williamson, of the University of Sydney and a DeepMind collaborator, spoke at the N.A.S. gathering and encouraged mathematicians and computer scientists to be more involved in such conversations. At the workshop in Los Angeles, he opened his talk with a line adapted from “You and the Atom Bomb,” a 1945 essay by George Orwell. “Given how likely we all are to be profoundly affected within the next five years,” Dr. Williamson said, “deep learning has not roused as much discussion as might have been expected.”

Dr. Williamson considers mathematics a litmus test of what machine learning can or cannot do. Reasoning is quintessential to the mathematical process, and it is the crucial unsolved problem of machine learning.
Early during Dr. Williamson’s DeepMind collaboration, the team found a simple neural net that predicted “a quantity in mathematics that I cared deeply about,” he said in an interview, and it did so “ridiculously accurately.” Dr. Williamson tried hard to understand why — that would be the makings of a theorem — but could not. Neither could anybody at DeepMind. Like the ancient geometer Euclid, the neural net had somehow intuitively discerned a mathematical truth, but the logical “why” of it was far from obvious.
At the Los Angeles workshop, a prominent theme was how to combine the intuitive and the logical. If A.I. could do both at the same time, all bets would be off.
But, Dr. Williamson observed, there is scant motivation to understand the black box that machine learning presents. “It’s the hackiness culture in tech, where if it works most of the time, that’s great,” he said — but that scenario leaves mathematicians dissatisfied.
He added that trying to understand what goes on inside a neural net raises “fascinating mathematical questions,” and that finding answers presents an opportunity for mathematicians “to contribute meaningfully to the world.”"
2023-07-03,"Adriana Stefanatos didn’t know how long she’d stay in New York — Three weeks? Three months? — when she moved from Australia. Five years later, she feels like she’s finally made it her own.
Unenthusiastic about early 20s life in Sydney, Ms. Stefanatos decided to give New York a try using a J-1 visa — which allows citizens of other countries to visit the United States to temporarily work in their field of study — and left the rest to fate. “I didn’t really know anyone at all my age in New York, so I thought, yeah, I’ll just see what can happen,” said Ms. Stefanatos, now a senior program manager with Amazon Web Services.
After living with family friends in Chelsea for a couple of months, she moved into a Lower East Side sublet until, thanks to a friend from Australia, she finally found a permanent living situation in a SoHo loft with three other roommates. She lived there for four years, but eventually knew that the end was imminent. The loft, in a cast iron building, was “falling to bits and needed a lot of work,” she said.

It’s all about the architectural details for Ms. Stefanatos, who loves the crown molding, pillars and built-in bookshelves in the studio apartment. Pink was the prevailing accent color of choice when she decorated, along with green touches.

The problems were many: a leak in the bathroom ceiling, construction on the roof and the upstairs apartment at all hours of the day and night, a leaking air-conditioning unit and bits of brick falling off the brickwork.

“In typical New York fashion, our landlord was not particularly attentive,” Ms. Stefanatos said.
Their landlord did warn them, however, that eventually he’d renovate the loft and, when he did, they’d need to move out. “Summer of last year, he called me and he told me, ‘Hey, we’ve got the permits approved, we’re going to do the work. So here’s your three months’ notice,’” Ms. Stefanatos said.
Though she was sad to leave the loft behind, the move presented an upside: Ms. Stefanatos could finally live on her own. Again, she left it to fate. “It was funny because I feel like my attitude to New York is, you put out what you get in,” Ms. Stefanatos said. “If I have an issue, I’m going to tell everyone about it because they might have a solution.”

Ms. Stefanatos mainly uses her kitchen to bake koulourakia (Greek Easter biscuits), a reminder of her home in Australia. “I share them with neighbors and friends but they’re basically the only cooking I do, otherwise I’m a typical New Yorker and often eating out,” she said.

She knew she wanted a one-bedroom or a studio and that it had it to be downtown — and she told everyone she knew in hopes of avoiding StreetEasy, which made her anxious. It just so happened that a former client-turned-friend knew someone renting out their Chelsea studio and a connection was made.

On staying downtown: Living downtown was paramount for Ms. Stefanatos who had spent most of her time in New York renting in SoHo. “Two of my closest friends live on the same street as me, so it’s a big plus,” she said.
On finally living alone: After sharing a loft with three other roommates she was ready to try living on her own. Living in New York is busy, Ms. Stefanatos said, and there’s so much going on. “I’m in a job where I’m speaking to people a lot,” Ms. Stefanatos said. “So it’s really nice to have that sense of self, that sense of space on my own.”
Upon visiting the studio, located on the ground floor of a brownstone, and meeting the landlord, it felt like kismet. “I didn’t look at anything else,”  Ms. Stefanatos said. “I just had a really good feeling about it.” She was charmed by the studio’s architectural details, which included pillars, built-in bookshelves and a desk, as well as a bay window overlooking the street.
Finding the apartment was easy, but then came the co-op board approval process. “That was a bit of a pain, to be completely honest,” Ms. Stefanatos said. On top of the usual credit check and financial documentation, the co-op board also requested five reference letters — and then called a few of the references.
“If anything, I didn’t realize how extensive the co-op process is, even for a tenant,” she said. “It felt personal, but I know it’s not. They just want to make sure someone will pay the rent on time and be a good neighbor.”

Still, sharing financial documents made Ms. Stefanatos the most nervous. She had been in the United States for only five years without much of a credit history and no guarantors to back her up. “It felt bizarre to share every piece of financial information with relative strangers to sign a lease,” she added.
Within a couple of weeks, however, everything was approved and she moved into the studio in October.

It didn’t take long for Ms. Stefanatos to embrace living on her own. “It’s my little dollhouse,” she said of the studio, which she promptly decorated in pink, from the wall art to the area rug. Books and knickknacks now line the built-in shelves.
The studio has a Murphy bed, and the rest of the furniture was sourced secondhand from antique stores or through dealers on social media. “I’ve kind of, over the years, collected a few pieces that I love. So that’s quite colorful,” Ms. Stefanatos said. She also hung a lot of artwork that she’d collected over the years.
The neighborhood itself is quiet and residential, and she appreciates the easy access to the West Side Highway for waterside walks.

Most important, though, is the feeling of home she’s found. It starts with the crown molding in the studio, a detail that nods to the building’s history. “It just makes me feel a little bit more connected to the sense of place. Especially, I think as an outsider living in New York, it feels like I’ve landed and I’m here,” Ms. Stefanatos said.

She’s bonded with the neighbors: Lefty and Sweet Pea, two cats that live across the hall. In the evening, Ms. Stefanatos and her neighbor leave their doors open so the cats stop by for an hour or so to explore her apartment.
Ms. Stefanatos wasn’t a cat person until she met Lefty and Sweet Pea (she grew up with pet chickens in Australia), but she loves them and they’re learning to love her, too. “I think that’s another nice thing that adds to the sense of homeliness and neighborhood-y feel that my building has,” she said.

2023-07-07,"John F. Kelly, who served as former President Donald J. Trump’s second White House chief of staff, said in a sworn statement that Mr. Trump had discussed having the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies investigate two F.B.I. officials involved in the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia.
Mr. Kelly said that his recollection of Mr. Trump’s comments to him was based on notes that he had taken at the time in 2018. Mr. Kelly provided copies of his notes to lawyers for one of the F.B.I. officials, who made the sworn statement public in a court filing.
“President Trump questioned whether investigations by the Internal Revenue Service or other federal agencies should be undertaken into Mr. Strzok and/or Ms. Page,” Mr. Kelly said in the statement. “I do not know of President Trump ordering such an investigation. It appeared, however, that he wanted to see Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page investigated.”
Mr. Kelly’s assertions were disclosed on Thursday in a statement that was filed in connection with lawsuits brought by Peter Strzok, who was the lead agent in the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation, and Lisa Page, a former lawyer in the bureau, against the Justice Department for violating their privacy rights when the Trump administration made public text messages between them.

The disclosures from Mr. Kelly, made under penalty of perjury, demonstrate the extent of Mr. Trump’s interest in harnessing the law enforcement and investigative powers of the federal government to target his perceived enemies. In the aftermath of Richard M. Nixon’s presidency, Congress made it illegal for a president to “directly or indirectly” order an I.R.S. investigation or audit.

The New York Times reported last July that two of Mr. Trump’s greatest perceived enemies — James B. Comey, whom he fired as F.B.I. director, and Mr. Comey’s deputy, Andrew G. McCabe — were the subject of the same type of highly unusual and invasive I.R.S. audit.
It is not known whether the I.R.S. investigated Mr. Strzok or Ms. Page. But Mr. Strzok became a subject in the investigation conducted by the special counsel John Durham into how the F.B.I. investigated Mr. Trump’s campaign. Neither Mr. Strzok nor Ms. Page was charged in connection with that investigation, which former law enforcement officials and Democrats have criticized as an effort to carry out Mr. Trump’s vendetta against the bureau. Mr. Strzok is also suing the department for wrongful termination.

Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page exchanged text messages that were critical of Mr. Trump and were later made public by Rod J. Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney general under Mr. Trump, as he faced heavy criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill who were trying to find ways to undermine him.
The sworn statements from Mr. Kelly are similar to ones he made to The New York Times in November, in which he said that Mr. Trump had told him that he wanted a number of his perceived political enemies to be investigated by the I.R.S., including Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page.

Mr. Kelly told The Times last year that Mr. Trump’s demands were part of a broader pattern of attempts to use the Justice Department and his authority as president against people who had been critical of him, including seeking to revoke the security clearances of former top intelligence officials.
In the sworn statement, Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump had discussed having the security clearances of Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page revoked, although Mr. Kelly did not take action on the idea. Mr. Kelly said that his notes showed that Mr. Trump discussed the investigations of the two on Feb. 21, 2018.
“I did not make a note of every instance in which then President Trump made a comment about Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page,” Mr. Kelly said. “President Trump generally disapproved of note-taking in meetings. He expressed concern that the notes might later be used against him.”
Mr. Kelly said that he never took any steps to follow through on Mr. Trump’s desires to have his enemies investigated.
Mr. Trump has said he knew nothing about the audits of Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe and their spouses. The I.R.S.’s inspector general found last year that Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe had been randomly selected for the audits, though the inspector general’s report acknowledged some deviations from the I.R.S.’s rigorous rules for random selection when the agency made final selections of the returns that would be audited.

Mr. Kelly told The Times last year that Mr. Trump had at times discussed using the I.R.S. and the Justice Department to address others in addition to Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page.

How did you sleep last night? Did you slumber lavishly, temperature and temperament aligned, waking with the sun? Or was it one of those stormy-seas nights, dreams indistinguishable from waking-life worries, tangled covers, eyes on the clock?
Sleep is mysterious, although we try mightily to make it less so. We use metaphors to describe it, diaries to track it, pharmaceuticals to manipulate it. I have spent a good decade trying to find the perfect pillow.
As we age, our needs for sleep change. The forces working against our undisturbed seven to nine hours multiply. In my 20s, I decided that if I was to lead a full and exciting life, I was going to have to be comfortable going to work exhausted. This seemed, at the time, like a workable model. I didn’t think that much about sleep. I thought about waking life, about how to get as much out of it as possible, with only brief pit stops to refuel. I would stay out late, barely sleep, vault awake with the alarm a few hours later.
“By definition, if you’re using an alarm clock to wake up, then you are chronically sleep-deprived,” Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, a sleep specialist at Penn Medicine, told The Times’s Dani Blum. If you’re getting enough sleep, you’ll wake naturally when you’re rested.

Now, in middle age, I’m determined to rely on an alarm only when I’m catching an early flight. Bedtime is sacred, and violating it requires a PowerPoint deck describing risks and rewards and return on investment. I’m always making calculations now, talking about sleep as if it were currency, feeling always a scarcity, greedy for more. “The sleep debt collectors are coming,” Oliver Whang wrote in The Times last year. “They want you to know that there is no such thing as forgiveness, only a shifting expectation of how and when you’re going to pay them back.”
I’ve been asking people lately about how well they sleep. Their responses are complicated. Even though we know we need to practice good sleep hygiene in order to be healthy and effective, I still detect a perverse hint of pride when people tell me they don’t sleep well, as if they’re society’s noble sentinels, up all night scanning the darkness for predators. Those who say they sleep well are a little bashful, as if their easy rest bespeaks a too-cosseted mind, a too-simple life. One person said of sleep in adulthood, “I just love sleep more now than I ever have. Does that make sense?”"

2023-07-10,"A dissident group within the Amazon Labor Union, the only certified union in the country representing Amazon employees, filed a complaint in federal court Monday seeking to force the union to hold a leadership election.
The union won an election at a Staten Island warehouse with more than 8,000 employees in April 2022, but Amazon has challenged the result and has yet to begin bargaining on a contract.
The rise of the dissident group, which calls itself the A.L.U. Democratic Reform Caucus and includes a co-founder and former treasurer of the union, reflects a growing split within the union that appears to have undermined its ability to pressure Amazon. The split has also threatened to sap the broader labor movement of the momentum generated by last year’s high-profile victory.
In its complaint, the reform caucus argues that the union and its president, Christian Smalls, illegally “refuse to hold officer elections which should have been scheduled no later than March 2023.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The complaint asks a federal judge to schedule an election of the union’s top officers for no later than Aug. 30 and to appoint a neutral monitor to oversee the election.
Mr. Smalls said in a text message Monday that the complaint was “a ridiculous claim with zero facts or merit,” and a law firm representing the union said it would seek legal sanctions against the reform group’s lawyer if the complaint was filed.
The complaint states that under an earlier version of the union’s constitution, a leadership election was required within 60 days of the National Labor Relations Board’s certification of its victory.
But in December, the month before the labor board certification, the union’s leadership presented a new constitution to the membership that scheduled elections after the union ratifies a contract with Amazon — an accomplishment that could take years, if it happens at all.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
On Friday, the reform caucus sent the union’s leadership a letter laying out its proposal to hold prompt elections, saying it would go to court Monday if the leadership didn’t embrace the proposal.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
The reform group is made of up more than 40 active organizers who are also plaintiffs in the legal complaint, including Connor Spence, a union co-founder and former treasurer; Brett Daniels, the union’s former organizing director; and Brima Sylla, a prominent organizer at the Staten Island warehouse.
The group said in its letter that enacting the proposal could “mean the difference between an A.L.U. which is strong, effective, and a beacon of democracy in the labor movement” and “an A.L.U. which, in the end, became exactly what Amazon warned workers it would become: a business that takes away the workers’ voices.”
Mr. Smalls said in his text that the union leadership had worked closely with its law firm to ensure that its actions were legal, as well as with the U.S. Labor Department.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Jeanne Mirer, a lawyer for the union, wrote to a lawyer for the reform caucus that the lawsuit was frivolous and based on falsehoods. She said that Mr. Spence had “improperly and unilaterally” replaced the union’s founding constitution with a revised version in June 2022, and that the revision, which called for elections after certification, had never been formally adopted by the union’s board.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Retu Singla, another lawyer for the union, said in an interview that the constitution was never made final because there were disagreements about it within the union’s leadership.
Mr. Spence said he and other members of the union’s board had revised the constitution while consulting extensively with the union’s lawyers. A second union official involved in the discussions corroborated his account.
The split within the union dates from last fall, when several longtime Amazon Labor Union organizers became frustrated with Mr. Smalls after a lopsided loss in a union election at an Amazon warehouse near Albany, N.Y.
In a meeting shortly after the election, organizers argued that control of the union rested in too few hands and that the leadership should be elected, giving rank-and-file workers more input.
The skeptics also complained that Mr. Smalls was committing the union to elections without a plan for how to win them, and that the union needed a better process for determining which organizing efforts to support. Many organizers worried that Mr. Smalls spent too much time traveling the country to make public appearances rather than focus on the contract fight on Staten Island.

Mr. Smalls later said in an interview that his travel was necessary to help raise money for the union and that the critics’ preferred approach — building up worker support for a potential strike that could bring Amazon to the bargaining table — was counterproductive because it could alarm workers who feared losing their livelihoods.
He said a worker-led movement shouldn’t turn its back on workers at other warehouses if they sought to unionize. A top union official hired by Mr. Smalls also argued that holding an election before the union had a more systematic way of reaching out to workers would be undemocratic because only the most committed activists would vote.
When Mr. Smalls unveiled the new union constitution in December, scheduling elections after a contract was ratified, many of the skeptics walked out. The two factions have operated independently this year, with both sides holding regular meetings with members.
In April, the reform caucus began circulating a petition among workers at the Staten Island warehouse calling on the leadership to amend the constitution and hold prompt elections. The petition has been signed by hundreds of workers at the facility.
The petition soon became a point of tension with Mr. Smalls. In an exchange with a member of the reform caucus on WhatsApp in early May, copies of which are included in Monday’s legal complaint, Mr. Smalls said the union would “take legal action against you” if the caucus did not abandon the petition.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The tensions appeared to ease later that month after the union leadership under Mr. Smalls proposed that the two sides enter mediation. The reform caucus accepted the invitation and suspended the petition campaign.
But according to a memo that the mediator, Bill Fletcher Jr., sent both sides on June 29 and that was viewed by The New York Times, the union leadership backed out of the mediation process on June 18 without explanation.
“I am concerned that the apparent turmoil within the ALU E. Board means that little is being done to organize the workers and prepare for the battle with Amazon,” Mr. Fletcher wrote in the memo, referring to the union’s executive board. “This situation seriously weakens support among the workers."

The only books I remember that were connected to California were the children’s novel “Island of the Blue Dolphins,” based on the life of a Native American girl who became stranded on one of the Channel Islands, and two of John Steinbeck’s classics, “Of Mice and Men” and “The Grapes of Wrath.”
My true California education has come from working as a reporter here, and from making my own way through fiction and nonfiction about our vast and complex state. (I just finished “The Library Book,” by Susan Orlean, which offers a compelling history of the Los Angeles Public Library and libraries in general.)
Today I’m introducing what I’m calling the California Reading List, a project of this newsletter that’s intended for everyone who’s looking for their next great book about California.

Readers have sent in hundreds of wonderful recommendations for the list, and I’ve been sorting through them (and requesting them from the library).
We’re starting the list with the 10 works suggested most often by readers. Among them are:
Wallace Stegner’s novel “Angle of Repose,” which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1972.
“The Octopus,” by Frank Norris (1901), the story of a conflict between California wheat growers and a railway company.
“The Dreamt Land,” from 2019, a deeply reported account by the journalist Mark Arax of California’s complicated relationship with its most precious resource: water.
“Tales of the City,” by Armistead Maupin, a 1978 novel (the first in a series of nine books) that The New York Times has called a “love letter to San Francisco.”
“The Grapes of Wrath,” which was published in 1939 and, as many high schoolers know, follows a Depression-era family of Oklahoma farmers hoping to find a better life in California.
In the coming months, I’ll keep adding to the list, so feel free to email me at CAtoday@nytimes.com with your choices and why you think they deserve to be included.

Smartphone Ban: Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a statewide ban on smartphone use in schools, joining a growing national effort to curb cyberbullying and classroom distraction by limiting access to the devices.
A Foreboding Fire: A wildfire that quickly consumed more than 14,000 acres northwest of Los Angeles signaled the start of what experts warn could be a dangerous and prolonged fire season in the West.
Tiny Homes: As the Supreme Court weighs whether cities can criminalize sleeping outdoors or in tents, Los Angeles is attempting to combat homelessness with tiny homes criticized by some as “inhumane.”
Here are the other five books that made the first cut, along with some of what you shared about them, lightly edited:
“Miracle Country,” by Kendra Atleework (2020)
“This memoir is impossible to pigeonhole. It is part coming-of-age story with heartbreaking family tragedies; it presents the troubling history of the Eastern Sierra, from the exploitation of Native Americans to the theft of precious water rights by an engineer whose work was crucial to the growth of Los Angeles. Kendra brings this beautiful part of California to life with expressive prose and spot on descriptive passages. I read her book after camping for two weeks along Route 395, and she showed me what I missed and primed me to return.” — Gary Moffat, Auburn
“Assembling California,” by John McPhee (1993)
“It’s a must to understand why California is the way it is — geographically, historically, culturally and socially. Perhaps especially for an Easterner, this book is an eye-opener, both to the past and to the future of this great state.” — Julia Sadtler, Philadelphia
“Mecca,” by Susan Straight (2022)
“I learned so much about the experience of immigrants and Mexican Americans in Southern California from this excellent book. It really exposed the hardships they face in everyday life trying to assimilate and survive.” — Joy Every, Oakland

“Season of the Witch,” by David Talbot (2012)
“I am a third-generation San Franciscan, and this is my forever book suggestion for friends from the city or new to it. It captures the soul of San Francisco and California while informing the reader of the intense history of the area from the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s. It shines light on politics, social issues and the impact our state had on pop culture.” — Katie Vestal, San Francisco
“Two Years Before The Mast,” by Richard Henry Dana Jr. (1840)
“An extraordinary telling of a young Bostonian’s journey as a sailor on a ship bound for California in the late 1830s. The ship was carrying food, goods to barter and finished shoes made from cowhides harvested from California ranchos.
“His descriptions of the early California coastline, with stops at San Diego Bay; Los Angeles (at the time, 30 miles inland, where the sailors picked up cowhides heaved over the cliffs by the locals); Monterey Bay; and San Francisco Bay, among other places, gives a glimpse into the rustic paradise our Golden State once was. In an afterword, Dana returns to a vividly and incredibly changed San Francisco. It’s a heck of a tale and a very worthy read.” — Ann Segerstrom, Sonora

Samantha Joseph’s childhood was scattered with golden trips to California to visit her Aunt Gail. Aunt Gail was the cool aunt. She worked in Hollywood and befriended actors like Robin Williams, Mayim Bialik and the cast of “Friends.” And yet she was still relatable (she’d get on the floor and play like a kid).
One day, those trips to California stopped: Aunt Gail no longer wanted to see Samantha’s family. Samantha was devastated, and several years later, she was devastated again by the news that Aunt Gail had died by suicide.
Today, Samantha shares her search for answers following her aunt’s death and how a conversation with David Schwimmer helped her to heal.

2023-08-03,"The smartphone industry is in a tailspin, with unit sales falling for two straight years, but Apple has escaped the worst of the downturn because wealthy customers continue buying pricey iPhones.
The world’s most valuable tech company, which relies on the iPhone for half its sales, reported on Thursday that revenue fell 1 percent, to $81.8 billion, during the three months that ended in June. Profit increased 2 percent, to $19.88 billion.
While Apple did not experience the rapid growth that investors have come to expect over the years, and the sales decline was the third of its fiscal year, the company narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and profit for the quarter.
Apple’s financial results were the latest indication that tech’s biggest companies have found their footing after last year’s downturn. Last week, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reported double-digit growth in profits driven by a rebound in digital ad sales. Microsoft posted a record quarterly profit behind a surge in cloud-computing sales, and Amazon on Thursday posted nearly twice the profit expected by Wall Street.

The tech industry limped through much of 2022 because of weak digital ad, e-commerce and computer sales. The downturn led Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon to lay off thousands of workers and spurred companies across Silicon Valley to cut back on perks such as free laundry services for employees.
Though Apple avoided layoffs, it is now dealing with how much the pandemic turbocharged its business. Sales of iPads and Macs exploded as people began working from home, but new purchases of tablets and computers have sputtered over the past year. In the latest quarter, iPad sales decreased 20 percent, to $5.79 billion, and Mac sales declined 7 percent, to $6.84 billion, the company said.
Apple’s share price fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the company projected that sales in the current quarter would be similar to the April-to-June period, as accelerating iPhone and software sales are offset by double-digit declines in sales of Macs and iPads.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Apple continues to be buoyed by the resilience of its iPhone business. While smartphone rivals Samsung and Vivo have experienced sharp declines in sales of low-priced phones, Apple has increased its market share and expanded its sales in emerging markets and China. The company is benefiting as tech-savvy customers with deeper pockets opt to spend more on phones with sophisticated features. Monthly payment plans make it easier to pay for those devices.
In the June quarter, the company made $39.67 billion from iPhone sales, down 2 percent from a year earlier. In China, where total smartphone industry sales fell 4 percent during the quarter to their lowest levels since 2014, iPhone sales increased 7 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm. That helped Apple post 8 percent sales growth in China, bucking the broader malaise buffeting the world’s second-largest economy.

“We’ve done a really good job with affordability programs around the world,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, during a call with analysts. “The majority of iPhones are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing.”
The company weathered declines in sales of its devices with continued growth in App Store and watch sales. The company’s services business, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, App Store sales and Apple Pay, posted $21.21 billion in sales, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. The wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, reported that sales rose 2 percent, to $8.28 billion.
Apple will continue to lean on its existing businesses for the bulk of sales in the coming years. In June, the company unveiled its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. But the $3,500 device, the Vision Pro, won’t go on sale until next year. Analysts project that Apple will sell fewer than half a million units, a small fraction of the roughly 200 million iPhones that it sells annually.
In the absence of a major new revenue stream, the company has focused on boosting sales in developing markets. It opened its first stores in India in April and welcomed crowds of eager shoppers. Its sales there have doubled in recent quarters from last year, as more and more Indians buy higher-priced phones. The rise in sales puts Apple in a position to capitalize on a market that is predicted to have a billion smartphone users by 2026.
“While I’m pleased with our growth there, we still have a very, very modest and low share of the smartphone market,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, during the call with analysts. “It’s a huge opportunity for us.”
Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in September, as well as updated models of the Apple Watch. Wall Street and industry analysts who track the company’s supply chain are not expecting any significant design changes or new features. Richard Kramer, partner at Arete Research, a stock research firm, said the 16-year-old iPhone had entered a phase where improvements were becoming “incrementally incremental.”"
2023-08-04,"To pack three seasons’ worth of English soccer stadiums with exasperated or exhilarated crowds, the Apple TV+ comedy “Ted Lasso” turned to dozens of background actors and powerful visual effects technology.
Using a technique known as crowd tiling, the company Barnstorm VFX helped film groups of extras in one alignment before rearranging them and filming them again, and then cutting and pasting the various groupings to fill all the seats. The show’s makers also used crowd sprites, in which actors were filmed individually on green screens and then arranged to appear as part of the crowd. There were even digital doubles: three-dimensional models whose movements were informed by a motion actor.
Innovations in digital technology and artificial intelligence have transformed the increasingly sophisticated world of visual effects, which can ever more convincingly draw from, replicate and morph flesh-and-blood performers into virtual avatars. Those advancements have thrust the issue toward the top of the grievances cited in the weekslong strike by the actors’ union.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors, fears that a proposal from Hollywood studios calling for performers to consent to use of their digital replicas at “initial employment” could result in its members’ voice intonations, likenesses and bodily movements being scanned and used in different contexts without extra compensation.

Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA’s chief negotiator, said it would be impossible for actors to provide informed consent without knowing how their digital replicas would be used in a cinematic universe or, in some cases, unknown future projects.
“That’s really abusive,” he said, “and not an OK way for companies to deal with somebody’s image, likeness or persona. It’s like owning a person.”
In an explanation on its website, the union says its counterproposals include guarantees for “informed consent and fair compensation when a ‘digital replica’ is made or our performance is changed using A.I.”

A spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that negotiates for the studios, disputed the union’s characterization of its proposal. The alliance’s position would “only permit a studio to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed,” the spokesman, Scott Rowe, said in an emailed statement. “Any other use requires the background actor’s consent and bargaining for the use, subject to a minimum payment.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
There were 17,000 active members of the union who performed background work in the last year, and more than 80,000 who have done it at some point in their careers, according to union figures. Background actors receive a daily rate of $187 for an eight-hour day.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Samsung: For the first time, workers at Samsung went on strike, as the company fights to regain its edge in the business of making memory chips, a critical component in artificial intelligence systems that are reshaping tech rivalries.
Mercedes-Benz: A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Disneyland: A majority of Disneyland cast members who perform as characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse and dance at parades voted to unionize with the Actors’ Equity Association.
Jennifer E. Rothman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school who specializes in intellectual property, said that if limits on digital replicas were not hammered out at the bargaining table, lower-profile performers might not realistically be able to say no to studio demands.
“It’s the up-and-comers and the extras who won’t have any leverage,” she said.
Lawson Deming, a visual effects supervisor and a co-founder of Barnstorm, echoed that view. Famous actors will be able to negotiate into their contracts that they own their likenesses, he said, but a vast majority of the SAG-AFTRA membership will not be so lucky.
“It’s not a question of technology,” he said. “It’s a question of who has the power in the relationship.”
That is partly because the technology is already here.
Such scenarios can sound like science fiction, but “performances” by the past selves of aged or even deceased actors have helped carry movies like 2016’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” Aided by motion capture recorded on a different actor, Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, reprised his role as Grand Moff Tarkin from the original 1977 “Star Wars” film. (His estate gave permission.)

“Digital humans have been part of the visual effects process for quite a while now — about 20 years,” said Paul Franklin, a visual effects supervisor at DNEG.

Initially they were created for what Franklin called “digital stunt doubles,” replicas of actors for stunts that were so death-defying or impossible that real-life stunt doubles would not do them. In one case, he helped a digital replica of the actor Henry Cavill fly as Superman in 2013’s “Man of Steel.”
Doing such work often involves a practice known as photogrammetry, in which many photographs of something physically real — like an actor’s head — can be used to digitally reconstruct it in three dimensions.
Technical wizardry is also used to build crowd scenes like the ones in “Ted Lasso.” For 2012’s “The Dark Knight Rises,” Franklin used digital techniques to fill the nearly 70,000 seats at Pittsburgh’s professional football stadium with just 11,000 extras.
Bob Wiatr, a visual effects compositor, was instrumental in filling out crowd scenes for “Daisy Jones & the Six,” a limited series on Amazon that had its debut this year. In one scene in which the camera, angled behind the titular rock band, looks onto the crowd, real background actors occupy the front rows, while computer-generated avatars fill up the rest.
“Sometimes there are people that are recognizable in the front,” Wiatr said, referring to other projects, “and they decide they want to do it from another angle later after they’ve already shot the scene, so they recreate the shot, and then usually you have 3-D-generated people — a lot of software can make it.”

That does not mean, however, that the task is simple or cheap. Deming of Barnstorm cautioned that concerns over reusing actors’ digital scans might be overblown.
“It is very complex to digitally take a scan of someone and make it animatable, make it look realistic, make it functional,” he said, though he allowed that “we’re making very big leaps.”

The biggest leaps are now being made in artificial intelligence. Last month the comedian Sarah Silverman joined class-action lawsuits against the companies OpenAI and Meta, accusing them of using her copyrighted written work to train their artificial intelligence models. SAG-AFTRA is concerned about something similar happening to actors’ performances.
Linsay Rousseau, a voice actor and performance capture artist, said performers were fearful of a future in which artificial intelligence reduces or eliminates roles for humans.
“We’re worried,” she said, “that we go in and record a session, they then take it, synthesize that voice, and don’t call us back. Or they process them to create new voices and thus do not call actors in to do that work.”

One visual effects company, Digital Domain, said in a statement that in the past five years it had used A.I. to “greatly accelerate” and “increase the accuracy” of digital avatars based on background actors.
“Machine learning is used to create a library of all possible facial shapes of a given actor, or the possible deformations of a piece of clothing or a set of muscles,” the statement said. “This library is then used to create a lifelike digital version of what was captured. We also have the technology now where we can create performances of historical figures based on existing footage.”
Franklin, a two-time Oscar winner for his visual effects work on “Inception” and “Interstellar,” said it was clear that technology had advanced beyond the scope of typical industry contracts.
“I think it is a valid concern,” he said. “People think, ‘Well, what’s going to happen to this data? How’s it going to be used in the future?’”"
2023-08-05,"On any given weekday, there is a statistically significant chance that Eric Adams, the mayor of America’s largest city, will be conducting official New York City business next to the upturned tail of the famed “Charging Bull” sculpture, engaging in what appears to be one of his favorite activities: raising flags.
He does it with such frequency that it borders on obsession: Since taking office in January 2022, Mr. Adams has raised flags for at least 31 countries representing 16 percent of the United Nations’ member states. He has honored some places twice: Haiti, Ireland, Ukraine and the Philippines.
His flag-raisings are not limited to countries. He has also raised the flags for one U.S. territory, two transnational organizations and one holiday, Juneteenth.
If he keeps his current pace, Mr. Adams is on track to raise flags for roughly 80 percent of the world’s countries by the end of 2029, should he win a second term in 2025 and serve it to completion.

At these ceremonies, Mr. Adams often extols certain characteristics that he attributes to the nation whose flag he is raising, characteristics that happen to be strikingly similar to each other, and to the mayor’s politically moderate, law-and-order brand.
To Filipino Americans, the mayor said: “You believe in families. You believe in business. You believe in public safety.”
To Croatian Americans, he said, “You believe in family, you believe in business, and you believe in public safety.”
And to Kazakh Americans: “You understand the power of education, you believe in public safety.”
Several top aides to Mr. Adams’s predecessor, Bill de Blasio, could not recall him leading a flag-raising ceremony to honor a foreign country; Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Michael R. Bloomberg, who served three terms as mayor, said the same.

For Mr. Adams, flag-raisings are a proven audience-pleasing tactic, one that he honed over two terms as Brooklyn borough president, a largely ceremonial position. He has embraced the practice as mayor, with an even broader political purpose in mind.

By honoring as many ethnic groups as possible in this city of immigrants with a flag-raising in the city’s oldest park — by the haunches of the nation’s most famous bronze bovine — Mr. Adams can woo voters in advance of his 2025 re-election bid. In 2021, he won the Democratic primary by just 7,200 votes.
“When you do an analysis of how close our election was,” the mayor said at a February flag-raising for Saint Lucia, the birthplace of 10,500 New Yorkers, “you begin to really benefit and understand how 10,000 people unified together can send a powerful message.”
That Mr. Adams’s office devotes so much effort to this sort of thing has become the subject of bemusement among New York’s political class. They acknowledge that the implicit political rationale makes sense, and that it is always fun to attend events where people say nice things about you and honor New York City’s diversity. But they argue that the mayor’s time is limited, and he is facing no shortage of problems: rampant homelessness, an influx of migrants, an affordable housing crisis, the erosion of the city’s tax base.
Indeed, a flag-raising for Belgium was scheduled for an hour after the mayor announced new restrictions on how long asylum seekers could stay in city shelters amid a record-breaking homelessness crisis. A flag-raising for Guyana came the same day the city’s first female police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, abruptly resigned because she felt the mayor had undermined her authority.

“As someone who represents a very diverse district, I understand the desire to make every New Yorker feel like their heritage is valued,” said Jessica Ramos, a state senator who attended a flag-raising for Colombia last year. “However, at some point it starts to feel like an empty gesture when taken in the context of other things the city should be doing — filling potholes, picking up trash, funding education.”
The flag-raisings persist because, the mayor says, symbolism matters. And what are flags, if not rectangular pieces of cloth embroidered with symbolic and emotional meaning for sizable portions of New York City’s electorate.
“He micro-targets,” said Richard David, a district leader from Queens who attended the mayor’s Guyana flag-raising. “Little things like this for some folks might seem superficial, might feel performative, but if you’re a part of this and being seen for the first time, it does mean a lot. And the mayor knows that.”
In a statement, Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the mayor, cited the city’s multiculturalism and Mr. Adams’s career-long dedication to honoring “these different immigrant communities that make up this city.” Mr. Levy said that participation by members of the mayor’s staff in the flag-raisings was voluntary, and that Mr. Adams took pains to highlight the communities’ shared values.

The mayor’s flag-raising routine has an identifiable rhythm.
His team cordons off the area where the ceremony will take place, just 13 blocks south of City Hall. The events are often underway by the time the mayor’s motorcade arrives. They have something of a pep rally feel.
Typically, a mayoral staff member or close ally steps forward to praise the mayor to a crowd of onlookers with ties to the country whose flag the mayor will hoist. That staff member or ally often has ties to the same country.
When he hoisted the flag for the Philippines in June, Maria Torres-Springer, his Filipina-American deputy mayor for economic development, vouched for the mayor. He “has always been and will always be a true champion of the Filipino community,” she said.
When Mr. Adams raised the Bangladeshi flag, his Bangladeshi American chief administrative officer, Mir Bashar, also vouched for the mayor, publicly thanking his boss for “his support and tireless efforts and his commitment to improve the lives of all New Yorkers.”
Generally, a consul general attends, alongside representatives from the local community. They often give the mayor gifts: a bracelet, a scarf, a framed painting, socks. He sometimes gives them a mayoral proclamation. Then he repairs to a set of two flag poles, and as the national anthem rings out, he raises the so-called Betsy Ross flag, its circle of 13 stars representing the original U.S. colonies. The foreign national anthem follows, followed by the flag-raising for that nation.

The two flags are each identical in size — 12 by eight feet. To have flags of different sizes would be a breach of protocol, according to John Hartvigsen, a flag historian and former president of the North American Vexillological Association.
To fly another nation’s flag next to the American flag signifies an alliance and honors New York City’s diversity, Mr. Hartvigsen said. But putting one on top of the other on the same pole would be bad, he added, signifying one nation conquering the other.
On a blazing hot day in June, Tara Seetaram, a Guyanese American who immigrated to the United States 35 years ago, said the mayor’s hoisting of the red-green-and-gold Guyanese flag, known as the Golden Arrowhead, gave her goose bumps.
“It’s beautiful,” said Ms. Seetaram, who was wearing a flag-themed dress her daughter had bought her on Amazon. “It makes me feel that, you know what, we have representation in New York City.”

It was one of the mayor’s eight flag-raising ceremonies in June and July. (The others were for Belgium, the Bahamas, Kenya, the Philippines and Italy, as well as in honor of Juneteenth and The Caribbean Community, a organization of 20 member states.)
On Friday, Mr. Adams raised the Bolivian flag; three more flag-raisings were scheduled for the following week, according to Arthur Piccolo, the chairman of the Bowling Green Association. In his comments on Friday, the mayor seemed eager to defend his presence. He said the events carried a symbolic message to people who left their countries for New York. “I appreciate what you bring to the city,” he said.
Mr. Piccolo said he has been raising flags at the two flag poles since the second flagpole was installed in 1996 — a gift, he said, from the Greek community.
Since then, Mr. Adams has been the only mayor to participate in a flag-raising ceremony at the Bowling Green site, Mr. Piccolo said, asserting that it “was too inconsequential for any previous mayor to care about this.”
After The New York Times contacted Mr. Piccolo, he sent an email to the mayor and his chief adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, praising Mr. Adams for establishing a new tradition he believed future mayors will uphold. Then he forwarded the email to The Times.
“Your dedication and commitment to this simple yet powerful symbolism have not gone unnoticed, and I believe it exemplifies a very, very good use of your time as the mayor of our great city,” Mr. Piccolo wrote."
2023-08-06,"Rex Heuermann, the meticulous architectural consultant who the authorities say murdered three women and buried them on a Long Island beach more than a decade ago, may have been among the last of the dying breed of American serial killers.
Even as serial killers came to inhabit a central place in the nation’s imagination — inspiring hit movies, television shows, books, podcasts and more — their actual number was dwindling dramatically. There were once hundreds at large, and a spike in the 1970s and ’80s terrified the country. Now only a handful at most are known to be active, researchers say.
The techniques that led to the arrest of Mr. Heuermann, who has pleaded not guilty to the crimes, help explain the waning of serial killing, which the F.B.I. defines as the same person killing two or more victims in separate events at different times.
It is harder to hide. Rapid advances in investigative technology, video and other digital surveillance tools, as well as the ability to analyze mountains of information, quickly allow the authorities to find killers who before would have gone undetected.
At the same time, Americans have adopted more cautious habits in their everyday lives — hitchhiking, for example, is less common, and children are driven to and from school. That reduces easy targets. And, some theorize, those bent on killing now opt for spectacular mass murders.
“The ‘perfect crime’ concept is more of a concept than it ever has been before,” said Adam Scott Wandt, an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

2023-08-07,"During the early months of the pandemic, a certain company went suddenly from relative obscurity to the type of popularity that made it a noun, verb and catchphrase.
“Can you set up a Zoom for us?”
“Let’s just Zoom.”
“I have Zoom fatigue.”
Revenue for the video conferencing company soared in 2020 — a jump driven by the millions of people who started working from home. Zoom was also part of the remote work shift that it powered, with most of its employees permitted to work from home.
But now, joining a swell of other tech firms pushing for in-person work, Zoom is requiring many of its 7,400 employees to start showing up at the office.
The company last week asked all employees within 50 miles of an office to work in person on a part-time basis, a plan Zoom said it would roll out in August and September.

“We believe that a structured hybrid approach — meaning employees that live near an office need to be on site two days a week to interact with their teams — is most effective for Zoom,” a company spokesperson said. “We’ll continue to leverage the entire Zoom platform to keep our employees and dispersed teams connected and working efficiently.”
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
During a tense meeting last week about the return to office policy, held on Zoom, Eric Yuan, the chief executive, faced a series of questions from employees who expressed frustration about the time and money they’d waste while commuting, according to an employee who was at the meeting but was not authorized to speak publicly about internal company matters.
In 2020, participants in daily Zoom meetings leaped to over 300 million, from 10 million the year before, as it became the most downloaded free iPhone app of the year. But the company has struggled to maintain its pandemic growth. In February, amid a wave of layoffs across the tech industry, Zoom cut 15 percent of its staff, or about 1,300 people. The company’s work force had grown more than 275 percent between July 2019 and October 2022.
On an earnings call in May, Mr. Yuan said he was confident in the future of workplace flexibility and the benefits it had brought for his company. “I think hybrid work is going to stay,” he said.
Zoom, like many other tech companies, is still holding on to some flexibility, requiring its employees to come in only on a part-time basis.

Hybrid and remote work levels remain far above what they were prepandemic. As of July, nearly one-third of the country’s full-time workers were in hybrid arrangements, spending some days working from home and some in an office, according to researchers at Stanford.
But dozens of companies have joined Zoom in tightening their policies on office attendance this summer, as offices remain at just under half of their prepandemic occupancy levels.
Google, which has asked employees to come into the office three days a week, announced that managers could take unexcused absences from the office into account when doing performance reviews and could use badge records to identify those absences. Salesforce, taking a softer approach, said it would give a $10 charitable donation per day on behalf of any employee who came into the office for a 10-day period in June.
Many companies have faced fierce resistance as they call people back to the office. Hundreds of Amazon’s corporate employees walked off the job for an hour in May, protesting the company’s announcement that they had to return to the office at least three days a week. At Apple, corporate employees signed petitions protesting their return to the office.
At the start of the pandemic, the tech industry was quick to embrace flexible work, which was enabled by the industry’s own products, including Slack (owned by Salesforce), Gmail and Zoom.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But many of those companies realized that they didn’t want their employees to remain permanently scattered. Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist and expert on hybrid work, said the tech industry’s move back to the office was no surprise given the amount these companies spend on office real estate.
Mr. Bloom said Zoom, for example, had all the downsides of fully remote work — some employees feeling disconnected — without the company seeing its financial upsides, like saving money on office space, because the company was still paying for Bay Area real estate and Bay Area employees.
“They’re paying for their office and hiring local people so they get no upside from being fully remote,” Mr. Bloom said. “The most surprising thing to me was they took so long to formally announce this.”
Recent studies have confirmed some benefits to in-person work. A working paper released earlier this year from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the University of Iowa and Harvard found that at one tech firm, remote work decreased the amount of feedback that junior employees received on their work. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that remote work at M.I.T. led to a 38 percent decline in “weak ties,” meaning the loose connections that help advance people’s careers.
Still, more than 90 percent of workers who can do their jobs remotely now want some flexibility in where they work, according to Gallup."
2023-08-08,"The ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, is a key American ally who counts on the United States to defend his country.
But he has traveled twice to Russia over the past year to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin, and in June, his country was celebrated as the guest of honor at the Russian leader’s flagship investment forum. Later this month, the Emirati and Chinese air forces plan to train together for the first time, a notable shift for an oil-rich Gulf nation that has long relied on American fighter jets, weapons and protection.
These deepening relationships show how a Middle Eastern leader viewed by the U.S. government as an important partner is increasingly striking out on his own path. American officials have had limited success in persuading Sheikh Mohammed to align with U.S. foreign policy — particularly when it comes to limiting Chinese military ties and isolating Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.
Instead, the Emirates has thrived on inflows of Russian money, oil and gold, fueling a feeding frenzy in real estate in the glittering metropolis of Dubai. The growing ties with both American rivals and expanding economies like India are all in preparation for a world that may someday be no longer dominated by the United States.

“What we’re seeing in the international order is not necessarily a multipolar world, but we’re seeing a more fluid world where things are changing,” Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to Sheikh Mohammed, told The New York Times recently. In a lecture in Arabic last year, he was much blunter, declaring that Western hegemony was “in its final days.”

Over the past decade, Emirati leaders have grown concerned about Washington’s long-term commitment to the Middle East, which still hosts tens of thousands of American military personnel. They fear a decline in American interest in the region — and the military defense that comes with it — and argue that Washington has not done enough to deter threats from Iran.
But at the same time, they continue to seek greater protection from the United States.
“I think it’s a hard moment,” Dana Stroul, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, told The New York Times’s editorial board in June when asked about the Emirati misgivings. The United States is still present in the region, but is “asking our partners to step up and do more, and that is a shift,” she added.
A federation of seven sheikhdoms perched on the Persian Gulf, the Emirates is roughly the size of South Carolina. Though small, it is one of the world’s leading oil exporters, and its sovereign wealth funds control an estimated $1.5 trillion in assets — more than the market capitalization of Amazon.

As its authoritarian rulers test the boundaries of their relationship with Washington, they are relying on the outsize international influence that they have built through wealth.
Emirati rulers wrote the playbook that other Gulf governments — notably Saudi Arabia — are borrowing from as they try to diversify their economies away from dependence on oil and expand their sway overseas, including through sports.
The Emirates moved earlier than its neighbors to pursue a more independent foreign policy and deal more assertively with the United States — a strategy that Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has since adopted.
It was a shift that developed partly out of a sense of vulnerability.
Until they united in the 1970s, the disparate territories that formed the Emirates had been British protectorates with a combined population of a few hundred thousand people. The new state was sandwiched between larger neighbors — Iran and Saudi Arabia — and some early observers expected it to be subsumed by them.

Instead, the Emirates turned into a regional power center. Today, Dubai is home to one of the world’s busiest airports, the world’s tallest skyscraper and a port company that operates facilities far beyond the Middle East.

Over the past few years, the Emirati leaders have seized opportunities presented by various calamities — including the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine — to cement their nation’s status as a triumphant entrepôt, where British multimillionaires mingle with Russian oligarchs and Indian tycoons.
“The whole world knows us now,” Mohammed Al Gergawi, an Emirati government minister, said in a rare appearance on a Saudi podcast last year. “They know our importance, and they know our influence on the world.”
The country’s bolder foreign policy began to emerge a decade ago, when the Arab Spring revolutions toppled regional strongmen around the same time that President Barack Obama declared a pivot to Asia. As the uprisings rearranged the Middle East’s power structure, the Emirates sent soldiers and weapons into the multiple regional wars that ensued.
In 2014, the country launched airstrikes in Libya without notifying the United States, American officials said at the time. And in 2015, after an Iran-backed militia seized control of Yemen’s capital, Emirati forces joined a Saudi-led military coalition to intervene. That war is still continuing, and it has plunged Yemen into one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.

In 2019, the Emirates declared a withdrawal of their forces in Yemen. That marked the beginning of a period in which the government shifted its rhetoric — if not always its actions — to a softer, economically driven diplomacy and preached peacemaking across a region exhausted by conflict.
The country emphasized de-escalating tensions, particularly with Iran — an approach that Saudi Arabia also embraced when it restored diplomatic relations with Tehran in a deal brokered by China this year.
Emirati frustrations with the United States have continued to simmer, though.
Sheikh Mohammed has not visited the United States since 2017.  A deal to buy American F-35 fighter jets stalled in 2021, and the Emirates has sealed a number of agreements to obtain weaponry from other countries since then, including light attack aircraft from China.
“You really want a firm commitment to your security in a very difficult area,” said Mr. Gargash, the adviser to Sheikh Mohammed, calling this an “existential issue.”

The Emirates’ status as a hub for business and tourism hinges on its relative safety in a volatile region.
But in January 2022, the capital, Abu Dhabi, came under drone and missile attacks claimed by the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen. One attack was thwarted with U.S. help — the Americans deployed Patriot missile defenses from an air base. But another attack killed three people, and Emirati officials argued that the American response had been insufficient, with reassurance taking too long.
“Can the American system actually provide you with what you want?” Mr. Gargash said, signaling that he foresees a longer-term problem. “It’s not about Biden. It’s not about Trump. It’s not about whoever comes later.”
At a conference in the Gulf nation of Bahrain in November, Brett McGurk, a senior White House official handling Middle East policy, said he heard constant concerns about the American commitment to the region.
“We unquestionably are here to stay,” he said.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year brought these tensions to the forefront.

The Emirates, along with many other countries, has made clear that it will not be forced to take sides. And Emirati officials argue they must keep dialogue open with Russia to pursue peace efforts and mediation.
When the Emirates abstained from a U.N. Security Council vote condemning Russia shortly after it invaded Ukraine, critics “came up with this phrase of ‘fence-sitting,’” said Mohammed Baharoon, head of B’huth, a Dubai research center.
“It presumes there is a good side and a bad side — you have to choose one, our way or the highway,” he said.
Nevertheless, the top priority of Emirati leaders is still “to ensure that the U.S. has a greater stake in the region, not a lesser stake,” said Dina Esfandiary, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group for the Middle East and North Africa.

Indeed, some of the Emirati foreign-policy shifts have been firmly in line with the interests of the White House. The Emirates was the Gulf’s earliest proponent of normalizing relations with Israel, which it did in 2020 in a deal brokered by Donald J. Trump.
At the same time, a gradual decline in American soft power is palpable across the Middle East, local scholars and businesspeople say.
A recent survey sponsored by a Dubai-based public relations firm asked Arab youth which country had the most influence over their region. About a third of respondents said it was still the United States. But the second-most-common answer was not China or Russia — it was the Emirates.

2023-08-10,"The wildfires that have killed at least 55 in Maui are burning on an island that also contains the part-time homes of billionaires, including Oprah Winfrey, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos.
The presence of celebrities and tech executives on the island has in the past created tension with locals. Few of the high-profile owners have commented publicly on the status of their homes during the fire crisis.
Representatives for Ms. Winfrey, who has lived in Maui part-time for more than 15 years, did not respond to a request for comment. According to Architectural Digest, her portfolio of roughly 1,000 acres on the island includes 870 acres in Kula, an area southeast of Lahaina where firefighting efforts were underway on Thursday. During brush fires in 2019, she gave Maui County access to a private road on the property to assist with evacuations.
The seclusion and natural beauty of Maui have long attracted celebrities, including Steven Tyler, Owen Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Willie Nelson and Jim Carrey. It has also drawn a suite of tech executives, who have purchased some of the most expensive properties on the island.

In 2011, Thiel, the founder of Pay Pal, paid $27 million for a home in Makena, on the southwest coast of Maui, which The Wall Street Journal reported was then the most expensive purchase of a single-family home in the county. Makena is roughly 10 miles from fires burning in South Maui.
Last year, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, one of the richest men on Earth, purchased a 14-acre estate on La Perouse Bay for an estimated $78 million. The bay is less than 20 miles south of fires in South Maui.
Mr. Bezos’s partner, Lauren Sánchez, posted on Threads, a new messaging app linked to Instagram, that the wildfires were “beyond heartbreaking.” She wrote that “Jeff and I have been on the phone with local residents and officials, and will be making donations to help.”
In 2012, the Oracle executive Larry Ellison bought 98 percent of Lanai, a Maui County island where Bill and Melinda Gates were married in 1994. Lanai does not currently appear to have been damaged by the blaze.
Mick Fleetwood, the drummer for the band Fleetwood Mac, said in a statement posted on Facebook that the restaurant he owned in Lahaina had been destroyed. He did not respond to a request for comment on the status of his home, which is also in West Maui.

The Fed’s new dilemma
The futures market this morning is overwhelmingly pointing to a big pause by the Fed at its rate-setting meeting next month as inflation moderates. But, as some Fed officials warn, it’s too early to declare mission accomplished.
That tinge of uncertainty is muting investor enthusiasm. Stocks initially rallied on Thursday following a Consumer Price Index and core inflation reading that showed price increases moderated again last month, further evidence that the Fed’s 18-month crusade to tame inflation by raising lending rates is showing strong results. (Exhibit A: The last two C.P.I. reports have shown the smallest back-to-back gains in nearly two years.) But later in the day a lackluster Treasuries auction, signaling sluggish demand for U.S. debt, took the air out of the rally in stocks and bonds.
The good news: Inflation has fallen sharply in the past year. The C.P.I. data showed further drops in so-called “core goods” prices, such as new and used cars and household furnishings. That’s a big change from a year ago, when pandemic-related supply-chain bottlenecks made such goods more scarce, pushing up prices. Another promising indicator: Rent inflation is easing.

President Biden was quick to point out the positive, as he looks to woo voters by talking about an improving economic outlook. “Today’s report shows that our economy remains strong,” he said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Several economists seem to agree. In a report on Thursday, Bank of America’s Michael Gapen and Stephen Juneau called the latest C.P.I. figure “encouraging,” adding that “we wouldn’t be surprised to see another soft August print given declines in wholesale used car prices.”
The less-good news: Food and fuel prices remain wild cards. “The recent sharp rise in crude oil, diesel and gasoline prices pose substantial upside risks to headline inflation in August,” Mahmoud Abu Ghzalah, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets, wrote in a client note.
That’s enough to keep the debate open about the future path of interest rates. Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, struck a hawkish tone, saying it would be premature to declare that rate increases should be taken off the table. “It is not a data point that says victory is ours,” Daly, a nonvoting member of the Fed’s rate committee, said following Thursday’s report. “There’s still more work to do.”
Energy prices will be a key data point to watch. “With oil prices and gasoline prices edging higher, the Fed may feel compelled to conclude its rate hike campaign with one last ‘insurance’ rate hike — but could now wait until the November meeting to decide,” Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in a research note.

The Supreme Court pauses Purdue Pharma’s settlement over the opioid epidemic. The justices issued an order to temporarily block a bankruptcy deal that capped the Sackler family’s liability at $6 billion and would have shielded them from more civil lawsuits. The decision will likely delay payment to the thousands who have sued the Sacklers and Purdue, maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin.
The Maui wildfire death toll rises to at least 55, as questions grow about the official response. Survivors have described harrowing escapes, and some said emergency warnings were too slow or nonexistent. President Biden issued a major disaster declaration and state officials are discouraging tourists from visiting Maui.
President Biden calls China a “ticking time bomb” because of economic problems. At a political fund-raiser, Biden pointed to weak growth, high unemployment and an aging work force and warned that countries in trouble often do “bad things.” A day earlier, the president issued an executive order to restrict investments in key tech sectors in China.

A good deal for luxury?
American luxury-goods companies have long wanted to build a multibrand rival to take on the European giants that dominate the industry. Tapestry, the owner of Coach and Kate Spade, said on Thursday that it would pay $8.5 billion to buy Capri, the company behind Michael Kors and Versace, in an attempt to do just that.
But investors were skeptical: Tapestry’s shares closed 16 percent lower.
Tapestry said the deal would be “transformational.” Big luxury conglomerates like LVMH and Kering have relied heavily on scale to outperform smaller groups like Salvatore Ferragamo and Burberry. They’ve used that heft to secure advantages on everything from access to prime real estate to advertising. Tapestry and Capri said the deal could lower their costs by $200 million over the next three years.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
But there are a lot of questions about the all-American tie-up. Tapestry is taking on an $8 billion bridge loan — the largest M.&A. debt financing deal this year. And Capri depends heavily on Michael Kors, which generates 70 percent of its revenue but is not seen as high-end and has been hit by weak demand recently. (Tapestry presumably sees an opportunity after turning around Coach.) By comparison, Versace, Capri’s only real luxury brand, accounts for just a fifth of sales.
Being a public company won’t help either. The European heavyweights benefit from being family-controlled companies, which means they typically have more time to make deals work, The Wall Street Journal points out. Tapestry doesn’t have that advantage.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Are more deals in the offing? M.&A. in the sector is heating up. Kering bought a 30 percent stake in Valentino last month and acquired the perfume company Creed for $3.5 billion in June. And speculation is swirling that Bernard Arnault of LVMH is weighing a bid to buy Bergdorf Goodman from Neiman Marcus.
One bit of potentially good news: China lifted a pandemic-era ban on group travel to more countries, including the U.S. and Britain. The country’s tourists were the biggest spenders overseas before the health emergency shut borders, and Chinese consumers are still a crucial market for the luxury industry.
Womenomics boosts summer spending
Taylor Swift is on pace to make music history as her “Eras” concert tour looks set to top $1 billion in sales, and Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour could make even more than that.
The record-setting musicians add to the narrative that the summer’s “revenge spending” spree is being led by women. The global box-office haul for “Barbie,” directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robie, who was also a producer, last week topped $1 billion.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Beyoncé, Ms. Swift and Barbie have become economic forces. Concert- and moviegoers aren’t just buying billions worth of tickets; they’re splashing out on the wardrobe, nails and, in the case of the music stars, airfare and hotel rooms — a fact noted by economic data-crunchers at the Fed and Sweden’s official statistics agency. The Times’s Jeanna Smialek and Jordyn Holman reveal another mind boggling stat: Swift’s tour could generate $4.6 billion in economic activity, surpassing the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
High inflation and an uncertain economy aren’t fazing these hardcore fans. Economists have noted that we’re witnessing a kind of revenge spending (or “fun-flation”), in which consumers, many of whom were cooped up during the pandemic, spend a big chunk of their income on entertainment and fun nights out — regardless of what the splurge costs them.
That kind of exuberant spending may prop up the economy in surprising ways. “I think Taylor Swift is great for the soft landing,” Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, told The Times.

David Solomon’s tough task
David Solomon became C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs five years ago, and it’s been a slog. The investment bank’s stock lags its peers, profits have fallen and the firm is pulling back from a high-profile effort to get into consumer lending.
Mr. Solomon has received a fair amount of criticism from partners, former executives and investors. He’s launched an overhaul that has included three rounds of layoffs and has led to the departure of senior executives. DealBook was first to report that John Rogers, the bank’s longtime chief of staff, would hand over some of his responsibilities to an associate of Mr. Solomon’s predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein.
In a sign of the displeasure, Mr. Blankfein has even offered to help right the ship, reports The Times’s Rob Copeland:
One day in mid-June, Lloyd Blankfein called David Solomon, chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Solomon had not been expecting it.
Mr. Blankfein, a big Goldman shareholder and Mr. Solomon’s predecessor, had lost $50 million since January on his stake because of the bank’s sinking stock. He made it clear to Mr. Solomon that his patience was waning, according to three people briefed on the conversation. Mr. Blankfein offered to provide him with more hands-on advice, or even return to the firm in any capacity that might help, the people said.
Mr. Solomon, politely but firmly, turned Mr. Blankfein down.

2023-08-12,"At 10 a.m. on a recent Saturday, a line of nearly 50 people — mostly women — stretched down a busy block in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Their eyes were on a pink-painted storefront adorned with pink balloons.
Moments later, sisters Bea Koch, 33, and Leah Koch, 31, emerged with an announcement: “We are open!”
The crowd cheered and applauded. Photos were taken. An hour later, the store was at capacity. And out on the sidewalk, the line kept growing.
It wasn’t a trendy croissant, or an influencer hawking a new video game console, that had generated so much enthusiasm. It was a bookstore: The Ripped Bodice, a shop devoted almost entirely to romance novels. Many fans had planned their weekend around the opening. Some traveled a significant distance to be there.
The store opened just as the Beyoncé tour, Taylor Swift concerts and the “Barbie” movie have dramatically demonstrated the economic power of women. It is the second location of The Ripped Bodice; the first opened in Culver City, Calif., in 2016 after a crowdfunding effort in which the Koch sisters received $90,000 in donations. They credit readers with making it possible to expand.
“The romance community is a force to be reckoned with,” Bea Koch said.

2023-08-16,"With mounting signs that the Federal Trade Commission is preparing to file a lawsuit against Amazon for violating antitrust laws, a group of booksellers, authors and antitrust activists are urging the government to investigate the company’s domination of the book market.
On Wednesday, the Open Markets Institute, an antitrust think tank, along with the Authors Guild and the American Booksellers Association, sent a letter to the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, calling on the government to curb Amazon’s “monopoly in its role as a seller of books to the public.”
The groups are pressing the Justice Department to investigate not only Amazon’s size as a bookseller, but also its sway over the book market — especially its ability to promote certain titles on its site and bury others, said Barry Lynn, the executive director of the Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group focused on strengthening antimonopoly policies.
“What we have is a situation in which the power of a single dominant corporation is warping, in the aggregate, the type of books that we’re reading,” Lynn said in an interview. “This kind of power concentrated in a democracy is not acceptable.”

The letter, addressed to Lina Khan, the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, who leads the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, comes as the F.T.C. appears to be closing in on its decision to bring an antitrust case against Amazon. Amazon representatives are expected to meet this week with members of the commission to discuss the possible suit, a sign that legal action may be imminent.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It’s still unclear whether the government’s case will scrutinize Amazon’s role as a bookseller as part of its investigation of the company. While Amazon got its start nearly 30 years ago as a scrappy online bookstore, it has since mushroomed into a retail giant that has gained a foothold in other industries, with its expansion into cloud computing and its purchase of the grocery chain Whole Foods and the movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
Even as books have become a smaller slice of the company, Amazon has become an overwhelming force in the book market. It accounts for at least 40 percent of physical books sold in the U.S., and more than 80 percent of e-books sold, according to an analysis released by WordsRated, a research data and analytics group. With its purchase of Audible in 2008, Amazon has also become one of the largest audiobook producers and retailers.
The effects of the site’s rise have been profound, Open Markets Institute and the other groups argued, contributing to a steep decline in the number of physical bookstores across the United States, and leaving publishers and authors beholden to the site.
Amazon also has influenced which books readers are exposed to and buy, and has made it more challenging for lesser-known authors to gain exposure on the site, while blockbuster authors and celebrities whose books are likely to sell well are prominently featured.

Some antitrust experts are skeptical that Amazon’s role as a bookseller merits government scrutiny. Erik Gordon, a professor of business at the University of Michigan who studies antitrust, said that while the company’s dominance in the book world might be an element of an overall antitrust suit, the F.T.C will likely focus elsewhere.
“There’s not a great case against Amazon with respect to their book-selling practices,” he said. “Many publishers and authors are making more money than they would have without Amazon.”
Amazon has already been a target of the Biden administration’s stringent regulatory efforts, as it has sought to rein in tech giants like Amazon, Google and Meta.
In June, the F.T.C. brought a separate case against Amazon that argued the company had manipulated users into signing up for its Prime membership program and made it hard for them to get out of it.
The Justice Department has also shown an interest in preventing the consolidation in the book market. Last year, a judge sided with the Biden administration in an antitrust case and blocked Penguin Random House from acquiring its smaller rival Simon & Schuster.

After the deal collapsed, some in the industry saw Amazon as the next logical antitrust target.
Allison Hill, chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, said that she was hopeful that the government was taking a serious look at Amazon’s role in the book world.
“Amazon has been unchecked for so long that our fight for a level playing field has become moot,” she said. “Amazon owns the playing field.”

2023-08-18,"Since 2020, the richest 1 percent has captured nearly two-thirds of all new wealth globally — almost twice as much money as the rest of the world’s population. At the beginning of last year, it was estimated that 10 billionaire men possessed six times as much wealth as the poorest three billion people on Earth. In the United States, the richest 10 percent of households own more than 70 percent of the country’s assets.
Such statistics are appalling. They have also become familiar. Since it was catapulted onto the national stage more than a decade ago by Occupy Wall Street, “inequality” has been a frequent topic of conversation in American political life. It helped animate Bernie Sanders’s influential campaigns, reshaped academic scholarship, shifted public policy, and continues to galvanize protest. And yet, however important focusing on the inequality crisis has been, it has also proven insufficient.
If we want to understand contemporary economic life, we need a more expansive framework. We need to think about insecurity. Where inequality encourages us to look up and down, to note extremes of indigence and opulence, insecurity encourages us to look sideways and recognize potentially powerful commonalities.
If inequality can be captured in statistics, insecurity requires talking about feelings: It is, to borrow a phrase from feminism, personal as well as political. Economic issues, I’ve come to realize, are also emotional ones: the spike of shame when a bill collector calls, the adrenaline when the rent or mortgage is due, the foreboding when you think about retirement.
And unlike inequality, insecurity is more than a binary of haves and have-nots. Its universality reveals the degree to which unnecessary suffering is widespread — even among those who appear to be doing well. We are all, to varying degrees, overwhelmed and apprehensive, fearful of what the future might have in store. We are on guard, anxious, incomplete and exposed to risk. To cope, we scramble and strive, shoring ourselves up against potential threats. We work hard, shop hard, hustle, get credentialed, scrimp and save, invest, diet, self-medicate, meditate, exercise, exfoliate.
And yet security, for the most part, eludes us. That’s because the main mechanisms by which we are told to gain security for ourselves — making money, buying property, earning degrees, saving for retirement — often involve being invested in systems that rarely provide the stability we crave. The stock in our 401(k), if we are lucky enough to have one, all too often supports industries that poison the planet; the tech company we work for undermines democracy; the rising price of the home we own makes it harder for others to stay housed.

2023-08-19,"Christina Murray printed all 53 pages of the document and wrote down her information. There was space to fill in the make and model of her car; her exes and their last known addresses and phone numbers; and any debts she owes.
The document advised including a recent photo of herself (“high resolution, if possible”) and descriptions of tattoos and identifying scars. One page left room for Ms. Murray, a 36-year-old clinical director in New Hampshire, to log her fingerprints and passwords to her social media accounts. She then printed two copies: one that she keeps in her apartment, where she lives alone, and one that she gave to her employer’s human resources department.
The concept of the “If I Go Missing” folder was popularized partly by the juggernaut true-crime podcast “Crime Junkie” in the summer of 2018 when the hosts, Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat, talked about what they keep in theirs, including logins, a written will and a list of “anyone that I think — right now there’s nobody, knock on wood — would have a grudge against me,” Ms. Flowers said.
The proliferation of the “If I Go Missing” folders (sometimes called “In Case I Go Missing” folders), which can be self-made or purchased in e-commerce sites like Amazon and Etsy, reflects the popularity of true-crime documentaries and podcasts.
Some women say the folders are a way to feel control in what can feel like an out-of-control world — but detractors say paranoia and a glamorization of victimhood are at the center of the phenomenon.
Adam Golub, a professor of American studies at Cal State Fullerton who studies true crime and culture, said those well versed in the true-crime world know who or what is going to get the most attention. “This is a way to try to intervene in that,” Professor Golub said. “It’s an attempt to exert some kind of control over your world.”

2023-08-20,"An establishment leftist and a newcomer businessman captured the top two spots in Ecuador’s presidential election on Sunday in a campaign cycle that has centered on voters’ frustration with the country’s soaring gang and drug cartel violence.
Luisa González, who was backed by a former socialist president, and the political outsider Daniel Noboa received the highest percentage of ballots with 84 percent of the vote counted. They will compete in a runoff election on Oct. 15.
The economy and security are likely to be the leading issues going into the runoff, as local prison and street gangs, along with foreign drug mafias, have unleashed a wave of violence unlike anything in the country’s recent history, sending homicide rates to record levels and hurting the vital tourism industry.
Concerns over the declining security were amplified earlier this month when the presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated on the campaign trail.

Ms. González led the election, garnering 33 percent of the vote, with 84 percent counted, followed by Mr. Noboa, the unexpected second-place winner with 24 percent. Just a few weeks ago, Mr. Noboa was polling in single digits.
Ecuador also voted on Sunday to halt drilling in one of the most biodiverse corners of the Amazon in a victory for a decade-long fight by environmental activists to get the binding referendum in front of voters.
Sunday’s first-round vote followed President Guillermo Lasso’s call for snap elections in May amid impeachment proceedings against him over accusations of embezzlement, as well as rising voter dissatisfaction over the nation’s security crisis.
Ecuador, a country of 18 million, was once a tranquil haven compared with its neighbor Colombia, which for decades was ravaged by violence by armed guerrilla and paramilitary groups and drug cartels. As that changed in the past few years after Colombia forged a peace deal, the narco-trafficking industry grew increasingly powerful in Ecuador.

Amid news reports regularly featuring beheadings, car bombs, police assassinations, young men hanging from bridges and children gunned down outside their homes and schools, Ecuadoreans are hoping for new leadership that can restore the peaceful existence they once took for granted.

The González-Noboa matchup means that “there’s still a strong, loyal base for Correísmo that’s enough to get González into the runoff,” said Risa Grais-Targow, the Latin America director for Eurasia Group, referring to the leftist movement of former President Rafael Correa, who governed from 2007 to 2017.
But, she said, “there’s a large share of the population that really wants something completely different — they want a new face.”
The surprise of the night was the second-place victory for Mr. Noboa, who was recently polling toward the bottom of the pool of eight candidates.
“The youth opted for the Daniel Noboa option,” said Mr. Noboa in a news conference Sunday night. “It would not be the first time that a new proposal would turn around the electoral establishment,” he added, referring to himself.

The 35-year-old comes from one of the richest families in Latin America, known to most Ecuadoreans for its banana empire. His father ran for president five times, unsuccessfully, but the younger Noboa’s political career goes back only to 2021, when he was elected to Ecuador’s Congress.
“He has a voting base that is familiar with the Noboa brand, with the Noboa name, and that now has been very successfully energized, refreshed with a new face,” said Caroline Ávila, an Ecuadorean political analyst. “He captures the attention of young people, the main mass of undecided voters. They are the ones who are putting him in the second round.”
Mr. Noboa’s campaign seemed to take off only a week ago, when he impressed many Ecuadoreans with his debate performance.
“He stands out in the debate,” Ms. Ávila said. “He speaks well, he speaks fluently, without complicating himself too much, without fighting. And it has generated a lot of interest in these post-debate weeks.”
As a legislator and member of the National Democratic Action Movement, Mr. Noboa supported bills to attract international investment and cut taxes, said Grace Jaramillo, an Ecuadorean professor of political science at the University of British Columbia.

“It’s a big surprise, especially in the fact that the debate did have an effect,” said Arturo Moscoso, a Quito-based political scientist. But he added, “For many Ecuadoreans he is an unknown.”
Mr. Noboa positioned himself as “the employment president,” even including an employment request form on his website, among other broad commitments to security and the economy. As a businessman and U.S. citizen who grew up in the United States, he is likely to favor American market-friendly interests, said Ms. Grais-Targow.
While analysts predicted security to be the main issue in the election following the assassination, Mr. Noboa’s success shows that in a country where just 34 percent of Ecuadoreans have adequate employment, according to government data, the economy is still top of mind.

One voter, Carlos Andrés Eras, 31, said he supported Mr. Noboa because he saw him as a well-prepared politician with clear proposals.
“It is not improvised; he has been putting together his political project little by little,” said Mr. Eras, who owns a jewelry store in Guayaquil. “He concentrated on giving his points and answered what was raised in the question without attacking anyone.”
Mr. Noboa came in just behind the leftist establishment candidate, Ms. González.
Backed by the powerful party of Mr. Correa, the former president, Ms. González, 45, has appealed to voter nostalgia for the economic and security situation under the Correa administration, when homicide rates were low and a commodities boom helped lift millions out of poverty.
“It is the first time in the history of Ecuador that a woman has obtained such a high percentage in the first round,” said Ms. González in her postelection speech. “We are going to have that homeland again with hope, with dignity, with security.”

Germán Montoya, a voter and the owner of a plastic company in Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, said extortion payments demanded by gangs were hurting his business and had pushed him to vote for Ms. González.
“‘Mr. Montoya, I can’t go there, here, because they charge me a toll,’” he said his employees tell him. The trucks are charged $50 to make deliveries in different parts of Guayaquil, Mr. Montoya, 37, said.
Jordy Gonzales, a 23-year-old construction worker, felt similarly. Mr. Correa’s party, he said, “did things right, and we are going to see if this time, if God allows it, it will be like before.”
If Ms. González wins the election in October, it will show the staying power of Mr. Correa as a dominant political force in Ecuador despite being out of power for six years.
He has lived in Belgium since he left office, fleeing an eight-year prison sentence for campaign-finance violations. But experts predict that in the event of a González victory, he would be likely to return to the country and try to seek office again before the next president’s tenure expires in May 2025.

Beyond Sunday’s presidential election, Ecuadoreans also voted to end drilling in the Amazon, dealing a major blow to the government, which had been lobbying to continue oil operations.
The section of jungle on the ballot, part of Yasuní National Park, is one of the most ecologically rich places on Earth and home to Indigenous people who want no contact with outsiders.
The state oil company, Petroecuador, will have roughly a year and a half to wind up its operations in the area, though experts say shutting down the oil field could take six to 10 years.
According to Andrés Martínez Moscoso, a law professor at the San Francisco de Quito University, neither the president, Congress nor a new referendum can undo Sunday’s results.
The decision is “a very clear signal, especially to the international community, of the population’s desire to turn this extractive economy around,” said Ms. Ávila. It would also force future governments to think of “other ways of generating income that are not exclusively from oil.”

2023-08-22,"Averting a strike that could have shaken the U.S. economy, the union representing more than 300,000 United Parcel Service employees announced Tuesday that its members had ratified a new labor agreement with the shipping giant.
The union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said that its UPS members approved the five-year contract with more than 86 percent support.
The Teamsters have said that the agreement includes wage gains of at least $7.50 an hour for current employees over its five-year term. It also raises the minimum pay for part-time workers to $21 an hour from under $17, and raises the top rate for full-time delivery drivers to about $49 on average.
Under the previous contract, which expired on Aug. 1, full-time drivers made an average of about $42 an hour after four years on the job.

In a statement, the union’s president, Sean O’Brien, said the contract was the most lucrative ever at UPS and would serve as a model for other workers that the union is seeking to organize. “This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,” Mr. O’Brien said.
The Teamsters have made unionizing Amazon a top priority in recent years, and Mr. O’Brien said while running for the union’s presidency in 2021 that doing so would first require big, concrete gains at other companies.
Despite the ratification, the new UPS contract will not take effect immediately. The union said in its statement that a group of workers in Florida voted down a supplement to the national contract that covers about 175 members — one of 44 supplements that the union also negotiated.

The union said its negotiators would immediately meet with UPS to resolve the remaining issues so that those Florida members can vote again. The national contract will take effect once the supplement is approved.
UPS declined to comment beyond a brief news release noting the ratification vote and stating that the Florida supplement would be “finalized shortly.”

The Teamsters had been aggressive in mobilizing members and ratcheting up pressure on the company in recent months, including picket-line practice and training sessions for strike captains. Mr. O’Brien has frequently referred to corporate leaders as a “white-collar crime syndicate” and argued that “this multibillion-dollar corporation has plenty to give American workers — they just don’t want to.”
UPS moves about one-quarter of the tens of millions of packages shipped in the United States each day, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. Its adjusted net income rose more than 70 percent from 2019 to last year, reaching more than $11 billion.
The negotiations on a national contract began in April, and the union announced in mid-June that its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike.
The two sides resolved many key issues by early July, including eliminating a lower-paid category of full-time driver that had angered many UPS employees, and requiring air conditioning in new trucks to improve heat safety. But then negotiations broke down, with the Teamsters arguing that the company had not offered sufficient improvements in pay for part-time workers, who make up more than half of the union’s UPS members.
Mr. O’Brien and the union spent the next few weeks condemning what they sometimes referred to as “part-time poverty” jobs, before the sides resumed negotiating in late July and quickly finalized a tentative deal.
UPS employees represented by the union began voting on the agreement in early August. While some part-time workers continued to argue that the wage gains should have been even larger and urged a “no” vote, the final margin suggested that most were satisfied with the deal."

2023-08-24,"If you’re an author who happens to be a glutton for punishment or, worse, an insomniac — or, disaster scenario: both — you might be familiar with a certain masochistic feedback loop. It begins on Goodreads, which tends to have the gentlest of anonymous criticism, and ends with Amazon’s ratings system, that easily sortable and searchable slam book which doesn’t tread on a writer’s dreams so much as stampede them. Between these poles are all forms of social media; and, on a different continent but still the same planet, reviews printed in the font you’re reading now.
When it comes to all of the above, James McBride takes a page from Herman Melville’s short story “Bartleby, the Scrivener.” Like the titular clerk, McBride prefers not to — in his case, read reviews. “I’m just not strong enough to do it,” he said during a phone interview about “The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store,” his new best seller, which Danez Smith described in their review as “a charming, smart, heart-healing and heart-blistering novel.”
McBride went on: “I’m happy for good reviews. I’m grateful that people read the work. But I’ve always found it healthier not to listen to what other people say.”
He credits his mother — and his background as a reporter — with instilling this attitude. “I went to Columbia for journalism,” McBride said. “I’m still of the mind that for anything good to happen in terms of gathering data, you’ve got to go out and just put your shoes on and hit the sidewalk. If you’re writing about humans, you’ve got to be around humans. The big secret to writing good books is to stay around people, and not stay around what they write on the internet.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
McBride admits that he will occasionally have a paragraph of commentary foisted on him by a well-meaning messenger who insists that he must read it. He won’t say no; it’s nice to receive a bit of praise every now and then. But, McBride said, “I can’t write for what other people expect; I’m just trying to explore the world.”
While he was working on “The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store,” McBride made a number of pilgrimages to Pennsylvania — to Pottstown, where the book takes place; to Norristown State Hospital and “the horrific Pennhurst sanatorium up the road in Spring City,” as he describes it in the book; and, perhaps most important, to the Variety Club Camp in Worcester, where he worked as a counselor when he was a teenager. (To find out how he wove these places together, you’ll have to read the book … or the review.)
“I wrote this book like I wrote all my other books. I went out and talked to people,” McBride said. “Oftentimes I came up with nothing other than an empty tank. But, you know, the gold nuggets are everywhere.”

2023-08-25,"The stock market’s monthslong rally stumbled this month. The thrill of seeing investment gains, with metronomic regularity, is gone.
I miss that feeling: scanning my investments and knowing in advance that the numbers will be larger than they were the last time I looked. But, in an important way, the market’s summer setbacks have been long awaited, and they come as something of a relief.
Don’t misunderstand. It’s not that I want to see the rising stock market stop in its tracks. I’d prefer an endless move upward, making me, and everyone else, richer.
But that’s a fantasy. In the real world, upward stock market thrusts are always temporary. When stocks rise too quickly, they inevitably fall and sometimes crash. The stock market is essentially volatile, and for every big winner, dozens of casualties occur.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That’s why, as a second-best alternative, I hope for something more modest: a choppy market that experiences periodic downturns, but one that trends upward for very long periods.
The Stock Market’s Movements
That is, in fact, a rough description of what the stock market has been like for the past 25 years, according to statistics provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. In that period, the S&P 500 has returned 552.31 percent, or 7.8 percent, annualized, but to garner those handsome returns, an investor would have had to sit tight through countless downturns.
While August has so far been a negative month for the stock market, there have been no major downturns this year. Through July, the S&P 500 rose for five consecutive months. Just seven big tech stocks — Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Tesla and Alphabet (Google) — accounted for more than two-thirds of the S&P 500’s gains.
This year, through July, the S&P 500 rose 19.5 percent, for a total return, including dividends, of 20.7 percent. Those were splendid numbers, but the market had been rising so rapidly on such a narrow base that it seemed to me that it was setting itself up for a fall.
What’s more, from a market bottom on Oct. 11, 2022, through July, the S&P 500 gained 27.9 percent, for a total return of 29.6 percent including dividends. In June, when the market had gained 20 percent from its October low, many commentators declared that the bear market that started on Jan. 3, 2022, was over, and that a new bull market had begun.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Silverblatt did not agree, because the market had not returned to its peak of Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&P 500 stood at 4,796.56, almost 9 percent above its current level. By his definition, it won’t be clear that the S&P 500 is in a bull market until it climbs back to that level. Categorizing the market this way, as either bull or bear, is a straightforward retrospective judgment, not an assertion of the market’s future direction, which no one can forecast accurately.
This cautious way of thinking about the market is one I favor.
I’m not sure what the rally that started in October will amount to, but based on history, the summer swoon could be a good thing.
The stock market’s problems in August stem, at least partly, from shifts in the fixed-income markets: a sharp rise in short-term interest rates underway since the start of 2022, and a surge in long-term rates since June.
The Lure of Fixed Income
Thanks to the rise in short-term rates, it’s possible to get a great return on cash. Money market funds provide yields well above 5 percent.
Bond yields have risen this summer, and they are now high enough to make bonds, with their safer profiles, an attractive alternative to stocks. And many factors driving up yields are negative for stocks, too.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Briefly put, short-term rates — those embodied in money-market funds as well as credit cards — are a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to reduce inflation. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy, mainly by raising the short-term rates it controls, the best known being the federal funds rate.
On Friday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said that until there is conclusive evidence that inflation has been tamed, the central bank will maintain these rate levels or take them higher.
Longer-term interest rates — those for bonds and mortgages — have been rising, too. But these rates are complicated. They are set in the vast bond market.
By bidding down bond prices and raising yields (prices and yields move in opposite directions, as a matter of basic bond-market math), traders have indicated that they consider the economy to be stronger and inflation to be more persistent than had been expected a few months ago. The downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency also contributed to the run-up in rates on Treasury securities. And because Treasuries serve as benchmarks for virtually every other bond and, indeed, for every other investment in the global economy, higher rates have made stocks less appealing in comparison.
In addition, the balance of supply and demand in the bond market has been tilting in a way that is contributing to higher rates. The Treasury has been auctioning an unusually large amount of debt, bulking up its resources after the brinkmanship of the debt ceiling crisis this spring. That increase in the supply of Treasuries coincides with a reduction in demand from several important sources: The Federal Reserve is no longer purchasing bonds, while the appetite for Treasuries from Japan and China has begun to flag, too.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
All these factors have contributed to the run-up in yields, and they are weighing on stocks.
Reading the Economy
Furthermore, one core issue assessed by bond buyers — the prospects for economic growth or recession in the United States and elsewhere around the world — has obsessed stock traders, too. But, at the moment, the U.S. economy is extraordinarily difficult to decipher.
Higher interest rates might have been expected to slow down the economy by now, or throw it into recession. A waning of economic growth in China might also be expected to be a drag on the U.S. economy.
But the U.S. economy and the job market, in particular, have been remarkably resilient, and consumer spending remains strong. As a consequence, corporate earnings in many sectors have exceeded Wall Street’s muted expectations. If a recession were to develop, however, the outlook would be much worse.
All that said, there are many reasons for optimism. In July, the market rally broadened substantially, with the stocks of smaller companies outperforming the giants, and every domestic sector posting gains. It was just what a stock investor would want to see in a market with sustainable upward momentum.
Even the surge in interest rates could turn out to be innocuous. After all, it has returned rates to a level deemed healthy in previous economic cycles. Since January 1962, 10-year Treasury yields have averaged 4.2 percent — not far from where they are now. The appropriate level for interest rates for the rest of this decade is being debated at the Fed and among a broad range of economists.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In short, uncertainty about inflation and the Fed’s response to it are well-founded. The paths of the markets and the economy may meander inconclusively for a while, thwarting anyone who wants to place a decisive bet one way or another.
But it’s a complicated world. Binary distinctions like bull market and bear market reduce complexity to simple notions that investors can grab onto. But I think these, in particular, are the wrong notions.
The bull and bear market labels imply future action.
In a bull market, stocks, for the most part, rise. In a bear market, more often than not, they fall. You might assume that you should avoid bear markets and welcome bull markets. But that’s not a wise course for long-term investors, who are better off buying when prices are low and selling only at moments of their own choosing.
I’m bullish about the stock market for the long haul. But that’s very different from believing that we are in a bull market or a bear right now. I just don’t know and don’t really care.
Instead, I’m investing for the long run, without trying to time market movements or pick individual stocks or bonds. I hold a piece of the world’s entire stock and bond markets — not just the S&P 500 — through low-cost, broadly diversified index funds, and have been hanging in for decades.

Market rallies are fun, and it’s a letdown when they take a breather. But an August pause could be just the thing the stock market needs. I worry about lots of things, but not that. Enjoy the rest of the summer."

2023-08-27,"The first time Erik Allen Ford, a founder of the clothing brand Buck Mason, tried on one of its T-shirts, it fit so badly that he thought the shirt was on backward.
“It was humbling,” Mr. Ford, 40, said of trying on that early T-shirt, which was made in Los Angeles with cotton grown in the United States. “It was the beginning of 50 iterations,” he added. “I slept in the sample room for a week.”
It was in 2013, not long after Mr. Ford and Sasha Koehn, another founder, had started the label in Los Angeles with a lofty goal: to make a superior T-shirt, a garment that emerged in the 19th century and that countless brands have tried to refine since.
The Buck Mason founders had little experience in apparel design, aside from some pattern-making classes Mr. Ford had taken. He had previously worked in sales and management for a couple of small clothing brands. Mr. Koehn, 41, had worked in media and, before that, as a landscape architect.
Now Buck Mason sells almost a dozen different short-sleeve T-shirts, which start at $45. Over the past decade, the brand has also started to sell other basics like jeans, sweatshirts and button-up shirts on its website and at the 24 stores it has opened in the U.S. But T-shirts represent a sizable chunk of its business, accounting for about 30 percent of all sales, Mr. Ford said.
Mr. Koehn called T-shirts “the gateway into the brand.” They have been recommended by Vogue, New York magazine and Wirecutter, the product recommendation service from The New York Times.

The first leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour has come to a close, with the pop superstar having performed in stadiums across North America for several million people.
A few of those people are friends of Popcast. This week and next, we’ll speak with a few of them about their experiences at the show.
On this week’s Popcast, conversations about the consonances between the Eras Tour and Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour, the way Swift does (and does not) deploy dance as part of her arsenal and the thrills of seeing Swift perform for the first time.

2023-08-30,"The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. Each month, we’ll choose three nonfiction films — classics, overlooked recent docs and more — that will reward your time.
‘Primary’ (1960)
Stream it on the Criterion Channel and Max. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.
The run-up to the presidential primary season is (somehow, already) underway. To see how different the nominating process once was, get a look at Robert Drew’s pioneering documentary.

The film has to be watched through the prism of its time. Doubly disorienting, it is a chronicle of the 1960 Democratic presidential primary in Wisconsin at a point when the majority of states did not yet hold primaries; it is also a fly-on-the-wall documentary from a moment when that form — made possible by the increased portability of cameras and sound equipment — was brand-new. While sitting in the room with John F. Kennedy, then the junior senator from Massachusetts, as he receives news of election returns may seem like the sort of sight you could easily catch on TV today, in 1960 it was an innovative, close-range portrait, offering “an intimate view of the candidates themselves,” as the film’s opening narration puts it.
Kennedy ran against his fellow senator Hubert H. Humphrey, of Minnesota, who during the events of “Primary” was campaigning only one state away from his home turf. His advantage is said to be with rural voters; Kennedy has strength in cities. The barnstorming seems oddly wholesome and congenial by today’s standards. The film shows Humphrey pitching a room of farmers on how the Senate votes he’s taken aren’t popular in Boston or New York. Elsewhere, cheering crowds greet Kennedy and sing along with his campaign song, a reworked version of Frank Sinatra’s “High Hopes.” And although much of “Primary” consists of speeches and handshaking, it gives the sense of having captured the national conversation in microcosm. Some voters express the fear that Kennedy’s Catholicism would influence his politics. One woman says she favors him precisely because he is Catholic.
Drew, who takes a “conceived & produced” credit as opposed to calling himself a director, went on to make other films with Kennedy, such as “Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment,” which followed the Kennedy administration’s actions to support the integration of the University of Alabama in 1963. “Primary” may end with its two candidates on roughly even national standing from where they started, but it inaugurated the direct-cinema movement. People who worked on it — including Albert Maysles and D.A. Pennebaker as cameramen — went on to make groundbreaking documentaries of their own.
‘4 Little Girls’ (1997)

Next month will mark 60 years since the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., an act of terrorism that killed four girls. Their deaths, Walter Cronkite says in an interview in Spike Lee’s moving documentary, became an “awakening” for Americans who had, until that point, failed to understand “the real nature of the hate that was preventing integration.”

Lee’s documentary, edited by Sam Pollard (“MLK/FBI”), leads by honoring the victims. The film opens with Joan Baez singing “Birmingham Sunday,” written in response to the bombing, over images of the graves and faces of the four girls, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Rosamond Robertson and Cynthia Wesley. We then hear recollections from friends and family members who knew them. McNair’s parents, Maxine and Chris, recall how painful it was to explain to Denise, at around age 6 (she died at 11), why she wasn’t allowed to order from a lunch counter. A friend of Wesley’s, Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski III, remembers Wesley’s sense of humor and kindness, and how they parted with the words “see you Monday,” not knowing what that Sunday would bring.
“4 Little Girls” also features interviews with civil rights leaders like the Rev. Andrew Young and the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who walks viewers through how he barely survived another bombing in 1956. (The commentators, billed as “witnesses” in the credits, include Howell Raines, the executive editor of The New York Times from 2001 to 2003, who wrote extensively about the events.)
But almost unavoidably, Lee’s most memorable interview is with the former Alabama governor George Wallace, a proud segregationist who now claims that his “best friend is a Black friend.” He insists on bringing his aide, Eddie Holcey, before the camera. “Ed come over here, just one minute,” he says. “Here’s one of my best friends right here.” Holcey, whom Wallace barely seems to look at directly, and who glances offscreen to make a sort of eyeroll, appears profoundly irritated at how Wallace is using him.
‘Geographies of Solitude’ (2023)
Rent it on Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.

The naturalist Zoe Lucas first visited Sable Island — a beachy strip that is less than one mile wide, and that lies 100 miles off the coast of mainland Nova Scotia — in 1971. Since then, she has become a tireless and largely solitary cataloger of life on the island: its hundreds of wild horses, its invertebrates and its seabirds, among other animals. She is heard discussing the possibility of finding species that don’t exist anywhere else. The diets of the birds, who have a tendency to eat plastic, are one indicator of levels of pollution in the ocean, another trend that Lucas tracks.
In “Geographies of Solitude,” the filmmaker Jacquelyn Mills, while not a naturalist (to be fair, she is credited as director, editor, cinematographer, sound recordist and producer), takes an approach to this documentary that is, in its way, similar to Lucas’s. Both women see boundless possibilities in the island’s treasures. Mills draws on natural elements to make cameraless short films that wouldn’t be out of place in a Stan Brakhage retrospective. With a contact microphone, she and Zoe record the sounds made by the wood of a decaying A-frame on the island. She finds out what happens to film stock when it is buried in horse dung. She hand-processes film in seaweed and electronically renders music out of the crawling of a Sable ant.
Mills’s work is interspersed throughout the movie, which becomes a striking combination of environmental documentary and profile. It’s also a landscape film that makes a real effort to attune viewers to sights and sounds, and that gently dips its toe into the avant-garde. Late in the film, Lucas says it appears that her life is Sable Island — “that’s all I have, that’s all I do, all the time,” she notes, adding, with a hint of regret, “I lost track of everything else.” “Geographies of Solitude” isn’t quite immersive enough to make that happen. But it captures a world where cameras seldom go."
2023-08-31,"The name placard on the dais said “A. Driver,” and if you’re making a Ferrari movie, you’d certainly better have one.
This particular Driver happened to be in high demand at the Venice Film Festival, which bowed on Wednesday and has mostly had to make do without famous movie stars as the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike prohibits actors from promoting films made by most major studios. But since the new Michael Mann-directed film “Ferrari” will be released domestically by Neon and internationally by STX — two companies that aren’t members of the group that Hollywood guilds are striking against — its star, Adam Driver, was free to make the trip to Venice and add A-list appeal to a festival in dire need of it.
“I’m proud to be here, to be a visual representation of a movie that’s not part of the A.M.P.T.P.,” Driver said on Thursday at the news conference for the film, referencing the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. He praised the interim agreement devised by SAG-AFTRA that allows stars to promote independent films as long as their distributors agree with the terms the actors’ guild is seeking.
“Why is it that a smaller distribution company like Neon and STX International can meet the dream demands of what SAG is asking for — the dream version of SAG’s wish list — but a big company like Netflix and Amazon can’t?” asked Driver, who has previously promoted Netflix movies like “Marriage Story” and “White Noise” in Venice. “Every time people from SAG go and support movies that have agreed to these terms with the interim agreement, it just makes it more obvious that these people are willing to support the people they collaborate with, and the others are not.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
After the crowd at the news conference applauded, Mann added, “No big studio wrote us a check. That’s why we’re here, standing in solidarity.”
You wouldn’t think while watching it that “Ferrari” is an indie movie. With a reported budget of $95 million, this is the sort of lavish adult drama that Mann used to make for major studios all the time. But movies like “Heat,” “The Last of the Mohicans,” “Ali” and “The Insider,” all films Mann made in the 1990s or early 2000s, have fallen out of favor in our superhero-saturated era, and expensive prestige releases like this one have recently struggled to break out at the box office.
Can the record-breaking success of Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” reinvigorate the sort of big-budget dad drama that used to be a theatrical staple? “Ferrari” is counting on it, even if its fellow December releases, like “Wonka” and “The Color Purple,” don’t necessarily lend themselves to “Barbenheimer”-level portmanteaus. (“Wonkari” and “Ferple” just sound like off-brand Pokemon.)
Like Nolan’s summer hit, “Ferrari” is about a midcentury visionary with a wandering eye: Driver’s Enzo Ferrari is a racer-turned-automaker who’s feuding with his wife (Penélope Cruz), hiding a mistress (Shailene Woodley) and trying to save his namesake company before it goes belly up. Mann tracks him during the summer of 1957, when it seemed like so many of Ferrari’s problems could be fixed by a single, momentous race. If one of his drivers can win the dangerous, thousand-mile race Mille Miglia, Ferrari reasons, it would stoke enough demand to lift the company’s fortunes. Still, his single-minded pursuit of that goal turns out to be a life-or-death matter with all sorts of unexpected casualties.
It may be hard now to conceive of “Ferrari” as a Driver-less vehicle, but over the many years that Mann tried to mount it, the director flirted with leading men like Robert De Niro, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, who went on to topline the Mann-produced “Ford v Ferrari” (2019). The 39-year-old Driver is called upon to play a man two decades older for most of the film’s running time, but that gray-haired intensity actually suits him: His Ferrari is hard-nosed and compelling, like a too-serious MSNBC commentator who slowly attracts an ardent, horny fan base.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Regardless of whether “Ferrari” can chase the box-office success of “Oppenheimer,” Driver said it was a miracle it was made at all, summing up the film’s truncated production schedule and false starts in a way that his title character could understand.
“It’s hard not to get philosophical about an engine — the amount of pieces that have to come together, similar to films, and work on the exact right timing in the exact right moment,” he said at the news conference. “And then there’s the element of human intuition and reflex. It’s a 50/50 marriage, and that’s very much filmmaking.”
When all those different elements manage to coalesce on a premium race car — or a big-budget indie film — it’s beautiful, Driver said. “It also makes you aware of how many things could go wrong at any moment,” he noted. “It’s a special thing to be part of.”"

Legal hurdles limit what can be done with Bloomberg L.P. after Mike Bloomberg leaves the financial data company.
Credit...
Victor Llorente for The New York Times
Bloomberg after Bloomberg
What will happen to Bloomberg L.P. after Mike Bloomberg steps away? That question resurfaced last week after the billionaire, 81, announced leadership changes and a new board for  the company he founded in 1981 after leaving Salomon Brothers. (That said, he told employees that he’s “not going anywhere.”)
Publicly, Mr. Bloomberg has said that his 88 percent stake in the company behind Wall Street’s favorite data terminals will pass onto Bloomberg Philanthropies, his charitable giving arm. But what happens after that?
The Times’s Ben Mullin reports for DealBook that Bloomberg Philanthropies is likely to sell Bloomberg L.P. or take the company public at some point after the transfer, according to two people familiar with the matter. Here’s why.
Operating Bloomberg L.P. for the long run could be tricky for the nonprofit. For that to happen, Bloomberg L.P. would need to qualify as an independently operated philanthropic business, according to Richard Fox, the founder of a Philadelphia law firm who specializes in private foundations.
To do that, the company would have to meet several onerous requirements, and Bloomberg Philanthropies would have to donate to charity five percent of the fair-market value of Bloomberg L.P. each year, Mr. Fox said.

Bloomberg L.P.’s profit would be subject to income tax, even if it was owned by a nonprofit, said Jim Friedlich, executive director of The Lenfest Institute for Journalism, the nonprofit that owns the for-profit Philadelphia Inquirer. Bloomberg L.P. generated revenue of more than $12 billion in 2022, according to data from the research firm Burton-Taylor International Consulting.
There’s a way for Bloomberg to drastically cut his tax burden. If the billionaire sold the company for cash and then donated the deal’s proceeds to Bloomberg Philanthropies, the initial sale would be subject to taxes — reducing the value of his overall contribution to his charity.
But if he gave the company away, he could avoid paying taxes, Mr. Fox said. He could probably donate his controlling interest in Bloomberg L.P. without affecting the company’s other shareholders, who would have a new partner: Bloomberg Philanthropies. The nonprofit could then sell Bloomberg L.P. tax-free.
Finding a buyer could take time. Bloomberg L.P. is a rare blend of financial data, media and technology assets, narrowing the list of buyers. Any purchase would be expensive: Not many of those suitors have tens of billions of dollars in cash lying around.
But the law gives Bloomberg Philanthropies a 10-year grace period to sell the company before the I.R.S. begins assessing an onerous tax, allowing some breathing room to find the right buyer.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
China unveils more moves to shore up its currency and economy. The country’s central bank said today it would reduce the amount of foreign reserves that financial firms are required to hold; that is meant to increase the amount of dollars available in the local market, allowing banks to cut interest rates on dollar deposits and making the renminbi more attractive. Authorities also lowered mortgage rates to ease pressure on the crucial property market.
Senator Mitch McConnell says he has been cleared to work after his freezing episode. The minority leader from Kentucky produced a letter from Congress’s attending physician that said “occasional lightheadedness” wasn’t uncommon when recovering from a concussion, which Mr. McConnell suffered in March. The news did not allay concerns among some Republicans about Mr. McConnell’s health and ability to serve.
Justice Clarence Thomas discloses trips taken with a billionaire. The Supreme Court justice reported three trips taken over the past year on a private jet owned by Harlan Crowe, after months of scrutiny over the men’s extensive ties and Justice Thomas’s failure to disclose them. Thomas included a statement in yesterday’s filing that suggested he had been advised to fly on a noncommercial flight for security reasons.
Taylor Swift sets her sights on movie theater dominance. A filmed version of her Eras Tour concerts will run in the U.S. starting Oct. 13, with AMC promising at least four showings a day, four days a week — including on premium screens and IMAX theaters. Shares in AMC jumped on the news, with ticket presales reportedly rivaling those of Marvel movies.

Hedge fund moguls get a new ally in a takeover fight
A group of high-profile financiers trying to break up Sculptor Capital Management’s deal to sell itself gained an important ally yesterday: Robert Shafir, the firm’s former C.E.O., reports DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch.
The decision by Mr. Shafir — one of the largest shareholders in the publicly traded Sculptor with a 6 percent stake — to join the opposition injects more drama into an already volatile takeover battle.
ADVERTISEMENT

The backstory: Sculptor, previously known as Och-Ziff Capital Management, said in July that it would sell itself to the real estate investment firm Rithm Capital for $11.15 a share.
But a group of investors including Bill Ackman of Pershing Square, Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital Management and Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group has sought to trump that bid, with its latest offer valued at $12.76 a share. Sculptor has rejected the approach, arguing that it’s less sure to close than the Rithm deal.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Shafir said he won’t support the sale to Rithm, calling the consortium’s offer “clearly superior.” In a letter to a special committee of Sculptor’s board, the financier said that it’s “not credible” to claim that the group of hedge fund moguls “does not have the funds and resources to complete this transaction.”
Mr. Shafir isn’t the only former Sculptor executive to criticize the Rithm deal. Daniel Och, the firm’s co-founder who stepped down as C.E.O. in 2018, this month wrote to the special board committee that the transaction “substantially undervalues” the hedge fund. Sculptor has rebuffed Mr. Och’s criticisms, calling them “based upon distortions and misrepresentations.”
A big question in any deal is the future of Sculptor’s management team, including its C.E.O., James Levin. The financier consortium has proposed replacing him.
There’s some extra dramatic context to the fight. Mr. Shafir and Mr. Levin competed to succeed Mr. Och as C.E.O. in 2018; despite Mr. Levin widely being seen as the co-founder’s heir apparent, Mr. Och threw his support behind Mr. Shafir. Mr. Levin eventually took over the reins in April 2021.

Inside Elon Musk’s power play to buy Twitter
Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter was a tale full of twists that not even veteran Wall Street deal makers could have predicted. In an excerpt in The Wall Street Journal from his forthcoming biography of the billionaire, Walter Isaacson reveals some of the chaos behind the acquisition, including Mr. Musk’s impulsive decision to bid for the social network.
Mr. Isaacson also sheds light on a coldhearted move by Mr. Musk: accelerating the deal’s closing by several hours, allowing him to seek to fire Twitter’s top management “for cause” before their stock options could vest.
It was audacious, even ruthless. But it was justified in Musk’s mind because of his conviction that Twitter’s management had misled him. “There’s a 200-million differential in the cookie jar between closing tonight and doing it tomorrow morning,” he told me late Thursday afternoon in the war room as the plan unfolded.
At 4:12 p.m. Pacific time, once they had confirmation that the money had transferred, Musk pulled the trigger to close the deal. At precisely that moment, his assistant delivered letters of dismissal to Agrawal and his top three officers. Six minutes later, Musk’s top security officer came down to the second-floor conference room to say that all had been “exited” from the building and their access to email cut off.
The instant email cutoff was part of the plan. Agrawal had his letter of resignation, citing the change of control, ready to send. But when his Twitter email was cut off, it took him a few minutes to get the document into a Gmail message. By that point, he had already been fired by Musk.
Hybrid work is winning
Chief executives aren’t letting up on their push to get workers back to the office. Andy Jassy, Amazon’s C.E.O., told employees last month that if they failed to return, “It’s probably not going to work out for you.” Meta announced managers would review entry badge data and consider firing those who failed to show up at the office. And even Zoom, a symbol of remote work, has ordered some of its employees to work in the office.
A number of companies have set deadlines for returning around Labor Day. Yet despite the tough talk, many are actually embracing a hybrid model: Amazon and Meta want workers in the office three days a week; Zoom wants some of them to return for two days.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Hybrid work is becoming the new normal. In July, 44 percent of employees whose jobs could be done remotely had a hybrid arrangement, 34 percent were working from the office full-time and 22 percent were working remotely, according to a survey by researchers at Stanford University.
The views of employees and employers are converging. Workers able to do their jobs from home said they preferred to operate remotely about 2.8 days per week and their employers are willing to let them do it about 2.25 days per week, the survey found.
Not all hybrid policies look the same. Some companies require employees to come into the office on specific days, others for a minimum number of days each week. J.M. Smucker, the food company based in Orville, Ohio, requires workers based at its headquarters to be on site for 22 “core” weeks per year. During these periods, the company says the office is 70 percent to 80 percent full and employees tend to log more hours.
But not everyone is convinced. Meta’s former director of remote work, Annie Dean, who is now at the software company Atlassian, has said a hybrid approach removes many benefits of remote work for employees and companies. She told Fortune: “This is a watershed moment of innovation of how work gets done,” and that we shouldn’t be obsessing about getting back around the watercooler.

2023-09-02,"Early afternoon, late summer. Humid, 83 degrees. The cicadas were whirring outside.
I closed my laptop, got up from the desk in my home office and went to the bedroom. I lay down and began flipping through “The Church of Baseball,” a book by the screenwriter and director Ron Shelton about the making of his 1988 movie, “Bull Durham.”
My eyelids grew heavy. Instead of fighting off sleep, I put the book aside and gave in to a nap.
These last weeks of summer, when the out-of-office replies pile up and even Wall Street takes a bit of a break from making money, might be the last time for people to be lazy, to loaf, to snooze — especially with return-to-office policies kicking in for many companies across the country.
Millions of Americans have already been called back to their desks. Now several firms whose employees have continued to work remotely, including Amazon, BlackRock and Meta, are cracking down.
Shortly before Labor Day, the Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy set the tone for fall by telling employees who had yet to return to the office that they had better start going in at least three days a week or, as he put it, “it’s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.”
With the more flexible, less monitored work days of the pandemic era possibly coming to an end, many people are preparing to bid adieu to the small pleasures of sitting on a porch and looking at the yard, of lingering over a morning coffee. And that’s a shame, according to those who believe in the virtues of loafing.
“It’s good for you,” Tom Hodgkinson, the editor and publisher of the British magazine The Idler, said. “It’s when you’re idle that the ideas come.”

2023-09-03,"It’s been 24 years since David Fincher brought one of his movies to the Venice Film Festival, and the last time, things didn’t go so well.
“I came here with a little film called ‘Fight Club’” in 1999, he told me during an interview on the Lido this week. “We were fairly run out of town for being fascists.” Even before the premiere of that controversial Brad Pitt flick, the director could sense trouble. “I looked down and the youngest person in our row was Giorgio Armani,” Fincher said. “I was like, ‘I’m not sure the guest list is the right guest list for this.’”
So what makes lofty Venice the right place to premiere “The Killer,” Fincher’s new thriller and his first film since the Oscar-winning Hollywood drama “Mank”?
“Nothing,” cracked Fincher. “Venice seems like it’s very highbrow — important movies about important subjects — and then there’s our skeevy little movie.”
Still, Fincher has always enjoyed toying with people’s expectations. He does it even within the world of “The Killer,” which premiered in Venice on Sunday and stars Fassbender as a hired gun who has to improvise after a fatal assignment goes awry.
Based on a French graphic novel and adapted by Andrew Kevin Walker (“Seven”), the film at first feels like a high-end take on the usual genre tropes: There’s the assassin with no name, the innocent woman in the way and the methodical list of revenge targets to be pursued. But then our protagonist’s constant patter of narration starts to show cracks, as the Killer often thinks one thing and does another. By the end, you’ll wonder if we know this guy at all, or whether he’s ever really known himself.
And then there’s what he’s wearing. Though Hollywood would have us believe that assassins always look impossibly chic and well-tailored, Fincher puts his protagonist in Skechers, a zip-up fleece and a bucket hat.
“He’s totally dorky!” the director said. “We were never intending for it to look glamorous.”
Inspiration struck when Fincher flipped through reference photos and landed on a German tourist snapped wearing those nondescript items on the streets of Paris. “I was like, ‘All of this stuff could be purchased in an airport,’” said Fincher, who sent the photo to his costume designer, Cate Adams. “I said, ‘This is what he needs to be, a guy who can get off a plane and buy a whole wardrobe on his way from the gate to the rental car.’”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Fincher found no complaints from his leading man, who wasn’t in Venice because of the SAG-AFTRA strike: “Michael’s cool. He was not freaked out about having to look a little dorky.” And that aesthetic extends even to the Killer’s escape from a botched job, which takes place not via high-speed car chase but with a zippy little motor scooter, though Fincher considered taking that sequence in an even dweebier direction. “At one point, we even debated the Razor scooter,” he said, nixing that only because it wouldn’t perform well during a stair stunt.
So though the Killer remains a mystery to himself, at least one thing can be said for sure of this indifferently dressed man: He ain’t exactly John Wick.
“The $3,000 suit seems like it’s played out,” Fincher said. Still, he was surprised to find someone wearing his protagonist’s silly headwear in another recent assassin movie: “It’s funny because when Pitt told me he had selected a bucket hat for ‘Bullet Train,’ I was like, ‘OK, dude, you’re stepping into our sandbox.’”
Though Fincher has a skill for image-making that extends back to the music videos he directed for the likes of Madonna, with “The Killer,” he was more interested in dismantling that sort of cinematic iconography. Instead of a glamorous lair, Fassbender’s character keeps his weapons in a mundane storage locker, and instead of using high-tech gadgets to break into targets’ homes, he orders key-duplication tools off Amazon.
“I was like, ‘I want James Bond by way of Home Depot,’” Fincher said. “By the end of this, you should be like, who’s the guy in the rental car line with you, and why is he wearing that outdated hat? You ignore the German tourist at your peril.”
And while the movies would have us believe that the world is full of clever, high-flying assassins, Fincher sought to ground his character’s tunnel vision in a more mundane reality. “I love the idea of a Charles Bronson character who’s maybe misdiagnosed adult autistic,” he said. “And before 2023, I’m not sure anybody would have gone, ‘Oh, that makes sense.’”

So if the Killer’s fashion choices or inner motivations sometimes stump you, just know that’s by design.
“He seems to have a hard time reading the room,” Fincher said. “And any room that he goes into, eventually, he’s the only guy in it.”"
2023-09-04,"Majestic vistas, burbling brooks and sanguine festival goers are the hallmarks of the Telluride Film Festival, a showcase for the most prestigious films of the year. But no amount of natural beauty can overcome the low-level of anxiety that coursed through this mountain town over Labor Day weekend. With dual strikes raging in Hollywood — the writers’ strike just hit four months — no one wants to appear out of step with these unprecedented times.
“It was hell getting here,” Julie Huntsinger, the executive director of the Telluride Film Festival, said in an interview. “There was just so much anxiety and nervousness. Once the actors went on strike, all bets were off. I had to call up every company and say, ‘Please, please, please, don’t go away.’”
But according to Ms. Huntsinger, it went off without a hitch. The festival, long considered one of the preferred stops for films vying for Oscar consideration, both for studio-backed projects and independent films, received every movie it requested, including a handful of world premieres.
Unlike most film festivals, Telluride is more of a viewing than sales opportunity — though some filmmakers do attend in search of distribution partners. This year’s program, one day longer than usual in order to honor its 50th anniversary, was filled, and only two directors didn’t show up. Stars, on the other hand, faced a more complicated situation because of the strikes.

Scheduled tributes for Annette Bening and Gael García Bernal were canceled. Prominent actors such as Austin Butler, Paul Mescal, Jodie Foster and Colman Domingo were not here even though their films were premiering. And those who did come were concerned about how their appearance would play to the public.
The SAG-AFTRA union, which has been on strike against the major studios since July 14, has forbidden its membership to promote any project financed by them. Independent films, though, can receive special dispensation from the union, termed an “interim agreement,” that allows its members to show up and tout their projects as long as the independent producers have agreed to SAG’s latest demands.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Eleven of the 26 narrative films shown were backed by divisions of the big studios, whose actors couldn’t attend the festival because of union rules.
Yet, SAG’s clarity on that guidance came less than a week before the start of the Colorado event, causing a lot of stress for actors eager to promote their films but anxious about running afoul of their union.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s film “Tuesday,” from the indie studio A24, received an interim agreement only on Monday, for a film premiering on Thursday. “I’m delighted to have gotten it. Obviously, I wouldn’t have come otherwise,” she said. “But it was a real mad scramble to get here.”

Ms. Louis-Dreyfus set a path for how her fellow union members can behave during this season of labor unrest. The actress made a rousing speech on behalf of her union’s fight at her film’s premiere and has followed it up with interviews that highlight both her work in the film and her stance on the strikes.
Studio executives would not speak on the record for this article because of sensitivities surrounding the strike, but said the screening experience has been bittersweet because actors were not able to share in their films’ success.
Emma Stone, the star of “Poor Things,” a film from Disney’s Searchlight Pictures that premiered at Telluride on Saturday, came to the festival as a spectator and did not promote her film, in accordance with guidance from SAG. Dakota Johnson, who has an interim agreement, also attended to promote and seek distribution for her film “Daddio,” which she produced.
And Ethan Hawke trekked to the mountain town with “Wildcat,” the independent film he directed about the novelist Flannery O’Connor, along with Laura Linney and his daughter Maya Hawke, two of the film’s actors. The three were also covered by an interim agreement.

Ms. Linney, who owns a home in Telluride and is a longtime attendee of the festival, admitted to being wary early on about attending. “I was very nervous before the interim agreement was made clear to us and why it exists and what it really means,” she said.
Emerald Fennell, the writer-director behind Amazon’s “Saltburn,” who is also a member of both SAG and the Writers Guild of America (she played Midge in “Barbie”), introduced her film on Thursday night while wearing a W.G.A. pin. She was allowed to be there because she was attending as a member of the Directors Guild of America, which recently settled on a new contract with the big studios, but her role is complicated because her movie is financed by Amazon, part of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group representing the major studios and streamers.
And on Friday afternoon, Kathleen Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm, a member of the studio alliance, and her husband, the veteran producer Frank Marshall, held their annual Telluride event at their house in town.
A handmade sign saying “Switzerland” adorned the entryway, and guests seemed to embrace the sentiment with executives from Amazon; National Geographic, a Disney company; and Higher Ground, former President Barack Obama’s production company, which has a distribution deal with Netflix, mingling with filmmakers and actors. The vibe was convivial and centered more on the movies than the contentious rhetoric heard on the picket lines.

On Friday night, the filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who are married, debuted their first narrative feature, the Netflix film “Nyad.” The film, about Diana Nyad’s 35-year quest to swim from Cuba to the Florida Keys, stars Ms. Bening as the swimmer and Ms. Foster as her best friend and coach.
Neither actress could attend the festival because Netflix is represented by the studio alliance and their appearances would be akin to crossing a picket line. Ms. Nyad, who as a sports broadcaster is also a member of SAG, also chose not to attend.
Rather, it was up to Mr. Chin and Ms. Vasarhelyi to carry the promotional load for the film, lauding the acting prowess of both Ms. Bening and Ms. Foster while also extolling the virtues of their studio for taking a flier on a subject matter that does not get a lot of attention in Hollywood, a sports drama that Mr. Chin called a “female, gay buddy comedy.”
But squaring their gratitude for Netflix with their support for the writers and actors on strike did not come easily.
“We’re just trying to be good citizens,” said Ms. Vasarhelyi, who in one breath uttered her utmost “respect for the writers and actors” and then praised “the great executives” at Netflix who protected her film.
“It’s a lot to balance.”"

2023-09-06,"The annual Group of 20 summit brings together world leaders in pursuit of a lofty goal: coordinating policy for the global economy.
But how much progress has the G20 made toward its ambitions? And what can be expected from this year’s meeting in India on Saturday and Sunday?
The agenda in New Delhi includes climate change, economic development and debt burdens in low-income countries, as well as inflation spurred by Russia’s war in Ukraine. If members can reach consensus on any or all of these subjects, they will produce an official joint declaration at the end.
Then what? Often, not much, when it comes to real-world results. Most of the grouping’s joint statements since it formed in 1999 have been dominated by resolutions as solid as gas fumes, with no clear consequences when nations underperform.

One example: At the 2021 summit in Rome, G20 leaders said they would limit global warming with “meaningful and effective actions,” highlighting a pledge to end the financing of coal power plants overseas.
But the communiqué left out domestic coal investments. And in 2022, coal-fired power generation worldwide reached a new high, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, investment in coal is expected to rise by another 10 percent, to $150 billion — despite G20 statements and a scientific consensus that coal use must end immediately.
What has the G20 accomplished?
The G20 began with a meeting of finance ministers after the wave of steep currency devaluations in the late 1990s, and added an annual meeting of world leaders after the global financial crisis a decade later.
More on India
General Elections: Though Narendra Modi won a third term as India’s prime minister, the election was closer than expected, forcing him to rely on coalition partners that don’t share his Hindu nationalist agenda.
Delhi’s Parched Slums: A heat wave has left water in short supply across India’s capital region. The poorest are left to crowd around tankers to get whatever they can.
Foreign Investors: Stock markets in Mumbai have surged as big global investors hope India can become a source of growth. It won’t be so easy.
The Brutality of Sugar: A Times investigation into the sugar-cane industry in the Indian state of Maharashtra found workers ensnared by debt and pushed into child marriages and unnecessary hysterectomies.
Senior officials (mostly Germans, Canadians and Americans) pushed for what they saw as a more flexible, inclusive forum than the Western-led Group of 7 nations, or G7. They believed that convening both established and rising powers would better protect the global economy, and early evidence suggested that they were right.
Many experts praised the group for stabilizing the financial system in 2008 and 2009 by agreeing to spending measures worth $4 trillion and instituting bank reforms to rebuild trust.
The 2016 summit in China also showed the power of bringing leaders together when President Barack Obama and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, announced that their countries would sign on to the Paris Agreement on climate.

More recently, in 2021, the G20 supported a major tax overhaul that included a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent for each country. It also backed new rules that would require large global businesses like Amazon to pay taxes in countries where their products are sold, even if they lack offices there.
The plan promised to add billions in government revenue and make tax havens less of a driving force for corporations. But, as with a lot of G20 statements, follow-through has been weak.
“The global tax agreement is an important step in the right direction,” the International Monetary Fund declared this year, “but it is not yet operational.”

Why has the G20 struggled to make an impact?
Some critics argue that the G20 was flawed from the start, with a membership roster based on the whims of Western finance officials and central bankers.
According to Robert Wade, a political economy professor at the London School of Economics, German and American officials “went down the list of countries saying, Canada in, Portugal out, South Africa in, Nigeria and Egypt out, and so on.”
For example, Argentina is neither an emerging economy nor among the 20 largest. It is a G20 member, many argue, because one of its former economy ministers, Domingo Cavallo, was a Harvard roommate of Larry Summers, the U.S. Treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001.
In an email, Professor Wade said the organization still suffered from a “lack of representational procedures,” without a well-defined process for inclusion.

“A given state is in or out, permanently,” he said.
The group’s summits have also become a forum for the forces pulling against the established post-World War II order. When the G20 started, there was more consensus about how to hold the world together. Free trade was ascendant; great power rivalry seemed but a memory; and optimists worldwide hoped that the G20 would lead to a broader power base for aging institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund.

Those hopes are still there, and blossoming elsewhere (the recent BRICS summit in South Africa is the latest example). But conflicts have supplanted G20 team efforts. The United States and China have become bitter competitors. Nationalism has surged as networked economies have come to look far riskier after the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which has pushed up food and energy prices for countries far from the front lines.
“There’s a lot more dissatisfaction with hyper-globalization, open trade and free capital,” said Stewart Patrick, director of the Global Order and Institutions Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “In a situation where the global economy is fracturing and countries are pursuing their own thing, the question is, what do you do when you still have rules and institutions that were created for a very different environment?”
Does the world need the G20?
Few critics want to see the G20 eliminated. They worry that it is already weakening, with Mr. Xi skipping this year’s meeting. (President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will also be a no-show.)
Many foreign policy experts argue that the G20’s failures simply point to the need for modernization in international institutions.
As Dani Rodrik and Stephen M. Walt wrote last year in Foreign Affairs: “It is increasingly clear that the existing, Western-oriented approach is no longer adequate to address the many forces governing international power relations.” They predicted a future with less agreement, in which “Western policy preferences will prevail less” and “each country will have to be granted greater leeway in managing its economy, society and political system.”
Professor Wade has called for a reformulated G20, with a core of economic powerhouses complemented by a rotating set of smaller nations. Mr. Patrick said the G20 could play a leading role in the “post-neoliberal” order by discussing how to separate the benefits of trade from the risks of overindulging the free-market system that the organization was built to protect.
“The G20 would be a natural place to begin hammering out what rules of peaceful coexistence permit countries to share in a more tempered globalization,” he said. “That would be a positive agenda.”"
2023-09-07,"At his State of the Union address this year, President Biden celebrated the fact that his new climate and tax law would no longer allow some of America’s largest corporations to pay zero in federal taxes.
“Because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent,” Mr. Biden said, referring to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. “God love them.”
The new corporate minimum tax was one of the most significant changes to the U.S. tax code in decades. Its logic rested on the idea that rich companies should not be able to find loopholes and other accounting maneuvers in order to pay lower tax rates than their workers.
But making the tax operational has become a mammoth challenge for the Biden administration, which has faced intense lobbying from industries that could be on the hook for billions of dollars in new taxes. Those groups have been flooding the Treasury Department with letters asking for lenient interpretations of the law and trying to create new loopholes before their tax bills come due next year. Republican lawmakers have been trying to repeal the law while Democrats such as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have been urging Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen to enforce it strictly.

The legislation, which passed with no Republican support, called for the corporate minimum tax to take effect in the 2023 tax year, meaning it will apply to corporate profits earned this year. But the tax was only loosely defined, and Treasury is still writing the rules that will determine how it is carried out.
The corporate minimum tax is entirely separate from the 15 percent “global minimum tax” that the Biden administration brokered with more than 140 nations in 2021. That agreement was aimed at stopping large multinational companies from seeking out tax havens and forcing them to pay more of their income to governments. While the deal is moving ahead in other nations, it continues to face obstacles in the United States, where Congress has been unable to ratify the agreement and allow the United States to comply with the global rules.
But Democrats were able last year to pass a domestic corporate minimum tax, which is a revival of a policy that was last employed in the 1980s. It captures tax revenue from companies that report a profit to shareholders on their financial statements, known as book income, while bulking up on deductions to whittle down their tax bills.
While the corporate tax rate stands at 21 percent, many large companies pay far less than that to the federal government. For years, big companies such as FedEx, Duke Energy and Nike have been able to take advantage of various deductions and tax strategies so that they effectively owe nothing in federal taxes. A 2021 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that 55 of the nation’s largest companies had paid no federal income tax the previous year.
An analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation last year found that about 150 companies with tax rates below 15 percent would be subject to the new tax. Companies like Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway, which have had effective tax rates in the single digits in recent years, could face the biggest increases in their tax liabilities, according to a summary of research about the impact of the tax published by the Congressional Research Service.

At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Warren E. Buffett, the company’s chief executive, acknowledged that there was uncertainty over the new tax but said he did not oppose it.
“We can figure out ways, once we know the rules, where we will pay the 15 percent tax,” Mr. Buffett said.
While the tax is aimed at some of the largest companies, smaller businesses have also expressed concern that they could be swept into the new tax regime if the regulations are not sufficiently clarified.
In a comment letter to the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service this year, CenterPoint Energy, a public utility company based in Texas, said it could be unfairly targeted because it had sold part of its gas pipeline and storage operation. Even though CenterPoint paid taxes on the sale, the gains could raise the company’s revenue enough to require it to pay additional money under the corporate alternative minimum tax.
“CenterPoint is neither a large corporation nor a corporation that did not pay its fair share but is being subjected to the C.A.M.T. as a result of transactions that reduced its business operations,” the company wrote. “The incongruity of the result is striking.”

The Treasury Department is expected to release the final rules for the tax before the end of the year. It already made concessions to the insurance industry, which raised concerns that the tax could upend its business model, and told companies that they would not be responsible for making quarterly tax payments related to the new minimum until all the regulations were clarified.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
“Treasury is working to ensure that the biggest and most profitable corporations pay their fair share and that the corporate alternative minimum tax is workable and administrable,” said Ashley Schapitl, a Treasury spokeswoman.
The 15 percent minimum tax applies to corporations that report annual income of more than $1 billion to shareholders but reduced their effective tax rate well below the statutory 21 percent. It was projected to raise over $200 billion over a decade.
Businesses that might face the new tax have been spending heavily to shape its scope and minimize their exposure.
According to Accountable.US, a nonpartisan watchdog group, large financial firms and industry groups representing international conglomerates spent more than $1 million during the first half of this year lobbying Congress over the corporate minimum tax and a 1 percent stock buyback excise tax that was also included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Accountable.US described that as a “significant” amount since Republicans already oppose the provision.

Many sectors are bracing for the tax’s potential impact, but energy companies, the film industry, financial firms and foreign companies that operate in the United States are particularly concerned, according to a review of comment letters submitted to the federal government and corporate filings.
“We’re trying to figure out how to add up apples and oranges, if you will, to make sense of it,” said Nancy McLernon, president and chief executive of the Global Business Alliance, which represents international companies that have U.S. subsidiaries.
Ms. McLernon, whose organization has a working group trying to ensure that the new tax rules can work alongside international accounting standards, lamented that the measure had only made things more complicated for businesses that invested in the United States.
I.R.S. tax forms, which allow for an array of deductions, and financial statements shown to shareholders present different pictures of a company’s performance. Investors use a firm’s book income to get a clearer view of the health of a business; however, some analysts have suggested that companies may soon start to take steps to obscure that measure.
Big businesses that will be hit by the tax are now trying to figure out what kind of income will put them over the $1 billion threshold and what deductions they may be able to keep.

When the legislation passed last year, Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona persuaded her Democratic colleagues to preserve a valuable deduction, known as bonus depreciation, that is associated with purchases of machinery and equipment. Since then, businesses that spend money on repairs and maintenance of their equipment have tried to make the case that those expenses should be included in that carve-out. Other firms, such as film companies, have tried to make the case that the cost of making movies should still be deductible from the new tax.
Despite all the lobbying, most companies are still trying to figure out how the tax will work and how much they need to worry.
“Anybody who is within the scope of the corporate alternative minimum tax has some pretty meaningful unanswered questions,” said Pat Brown, co-leader of PwC’s Washington National Tax Services practice and a former Treasury official.
Tax and accounting experts have warned for years that this type of corporate minimum tax would not be easy. They contend that it creates a new tax base and has the potential to encourage companies to change how they report their financial income to seek out new loopholes.
William McBride, the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, which has been critical of the new minimum tax, said it had been difficult to set up because it was misguided in the first place. He argued that trying to marry accounting rules and tax laws was a recipe for confusion.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s not clear if it’s even resolvable in a way that’s going to satisfy taxpayers such that they’re not stuck with enormous compliance costs,” Mr. McBride said.
Efforts to overturn the tax will be fruitless while Mr. Biden is in office, but that hasn’t stopped Republican lawmakers from trying.
Backed by lobbyists from the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Mining Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Western Energy Alliance, Senate Republicans introduced legislation in May to repeal what they described as a “reckless and complicated” tax that targets job creators."

Luxury and celebrity: Is it an unbeatable combination?

Putting a price on celebrity
In buying a majority stake in the powerhouse Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency, François-Henri Pinault showed that high-ticket M.&A. is a game that more than one French luxury billionaire can play.
Acquiring CAA — which represents stars including Tom Hanks, Margot Robbie and Pinault’s wife, Salma Hayek Pinault — underscores Pinault’s ambitions, and reinforces the growing importance of celebrity in the luxury sector.
Pinault is no stranger to deal making. Like his archrival, Bernard Arnault of LVMH, Pinault used a series of acquisitions to assemble the luxury empire now known as Kering, starting with Gucci and later adding Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen and more.
Through Artémis, his family’s investment arm — which owns a 42 percent stake in Kering, a stake in the sportswear brand Puma and all of the Christie’s auction house — Pinault will now control CAA (reportedly at a valuation of $7 billion, including debt). The agency will be run separately from Kering; Bryan Lourd, the superagent who represents Scarlett Johansson and Brad Pitt, will become C.E.O. of CAA.

Pinault is betting on the power of boldface names. Celebrities attract legions of followers primed to buy what they’re promoting, driving fashion brands to lock up the biggest names to pitch their products. Hayek Pinault plays into that, wearing Gucci and Balenciaga gowns on the red carpet and appearing next to her husband at fashion shows.
“There’s no separation between fashion and entertainment anymore,” the luxury consultant Robert Burke told The Times, calling the deal a “natural, if unprecedented, evolution.”
It’s a reciprocal relationship, especially now: With the actors’ strike prohibiting promotion of movies and TV shows, commercial work with brands is one of the few union-approved ways celebrities can still make money.
The deal also marks a cashing out for the investment giant TPG, which is selling its majority stake in CAA to Pinault. TPG first bought into CAA 13 years ago, setting off a race among private equity firms to get into the talent business. Silver Lake later invested in William Morris Endeavor, and last year EQT invested in United Talent Agency.
Meanwhile, CAA’s rivals have sought to scale up to strengthen their leverage over streaming giants like Amazon, Netflix and Apple. (Endeavor, with help from Silver Lake, oversees an empire that spans talent representation and the soon-to-be-combined Ultimate Fighting Championship and WWE.)
In other luxury news: Giorgio Armani, 89, said he has no desire to sell his fashion house to Kering or LVMH: “Why should I be dominated by one of these mega structures that lack personality?” he told The Financial Times.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Senators introduce a bipartisan proposal for A.I. regulation. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, will put forward legislation that would require licenses for and audits of artificial intelligence, and create a new government watchdog. It’s the latest step by a Washington grappling with A.I. Congressional leaders will hear more from tech executives on the subject next week.
Goldman Sachs’s C.E.O. pushes back against critics. David Solomon defended his sometimes turbulent tenure as leader of the Wall Street bank in an interview with CNBC, amid lagging performance and others carping about his track record; “I don’t recognize the caricature that is painted of me,” he said. Meanwhile, Goldman is planning to lay off more employees, according to The Financial Times.
The S.E.C. is reportedly looking into Ryan Cohen’s trades in Bed Bath & Beyond. A focus of the regulator’s inquiry is Cohen’s investing of $120 million in the struggling housewares retailer and then abruptly selling his stake days after publicly praising the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. Shareholders have already sued the billionaire, accusing him of a pump-and-dump scheme.
Walmart is said to cut pay for some new workers. The retail giant will pay most new hourly workers the lowest possible wage for their store, abandoning a system in which some positions were paid more than others from the start, The Wall Street Journal reports. It’s another sign of companies feeling less pressure to offer higher pay to attract workers as labor markets cool.

The pressure mounts on Bankman-Fried
Ryan Salame, the former co-C.E.O. of the crypto exchange FTX, who made millions during the sector’s boom years, pleaded guilty on Thursday to criminal charges for his role in exchange’s collapse last year, leaving its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, increasingly isolated just weeks before his criminal trial.
Salame, 30, who has become a major Republican donor, admitted to breaking campaign finance laws and operating an unlicensed money transmission business. He is set to be sentenced in March.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Salame is the fourth Bankman-Fried deputy to plead guilty. He told a federal judge in New York on Thursday that he had made millions in political contributions at the direction of Bankman-Fried, all labeled as loans from FTX’s sister company, the crypto hedge fund Alameda Research.
“I understood that the loans would eventually be forgiven, and that I would never have to repay them,” he said, entering his plea wearing a suit and tie with socks featuring Bitcoin logos. He stood in front of the same judge who is presiding over the Bankman-Fried proceedings.
Salame will pay a $6 million fine and more than $5 million in restitution to the bankrupt FTX. He will forfeit two properties in Lenox, Mass., along with a Porsche. He also faces up to 10 years in prison. Other former colleagues from the FTX empire — Nishad Singh, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang — pleaded guilty on charges related to the implosion of the crypto business, which saw investors lose billions. Unlike Salame, those three have agreed to cooperate with the authorities, and are expected to testify against him.
The legal pressures are mounting on Bankman-Fried. Lawyers for the 31-year-old — who is being held in jail after a judge ruled that he had twice tried to interfere with witnesses in the case — have argued that he is unable to adequately prepare for his fraud trial, set to begin Oct. 3.
A new job for a top New York public defender
David Patton, an influential lawyer and longtime head of New York City’s federal public defenders office, is stepping down to become a partner at the boutique law firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink, report The Times’s Benjamin Weiser and Karen Zraick for DealBook.
A team led by one of the firm’s name partners, Roberta Kaplan, recently won a $5 million civil trial verdict in which a federal jury in Manhattan found former President Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.

Patton has led Federal Defenders of New York for 12 years. In his post, he oversees lawyers who represent indigent defendants in New York’s Southern and Eastern District. He has handled dozens of federal trials, including the first death penalty trial of the Biden administration, which resulted in a life sentence. Patton said he would leave Federal Defenders at the end of October; Barry Leiwant, the head of its appeals unit, will lead the office on an interim basis.
Patton, an outspoken critic of conditions in jails, has worked with the law firm before. The Federal Defenders, represented by Kaplan Hecker & Fink, sued the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2019 after a weeklong blackout at a Brooklyn federal jail left inmates without heat, power or access to their lawyers.
Sean Hecker, another of the firm’s partners, said there was a “perfect synergy” with Patton, given the firm’s commitment to public interest. Patton said joining Kaplan Hecker would enable him “to practice law at the highest level — to try cases and to still maintain a strong commitment to public service.”

$125 million
— The amount Mattel says it expects to make in total billings from “Barbie.” The film appears headed toward a box office haul of $2 billion, giving the toymaker a share in the kind of runaway hit that has eluded it for years.
Apple by the numbers
Shares in Apple were hovering around break-even in premarket this morning, another ominous sign for shareholders after the tech giant’s stock sank 6 percent this week on reports of a potential iPhone crackdown in China. Here are a few points to put that into perspective:
$190 billion: The two-day sell-off shaved roughly $190 billion off Apple’s market value and at one point on Thursday the loss topped $200 billion, more than Netflix’s market cap of $196 billion.

$2.8 trillion: That’s Apple’s current market cap, which still makes it the world’s most valuable public company.
7%: Apple makes up 7 percent of the weighted value of the entire S&P 500, making it one of the most widely held stocks. A bad day for Apple shares can often drag down that benchmark, as well as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite. Both indexes fell on Thursday, though they outperformed Apple.
Up next: Investors (and gadget fans) will be watching the iPhone 15 rollout on Tuesday, as questions swirl over whether a new model can recharge the company’s fortunes.

2023-09-10,"The N.F.L. off-season has gotten shorter since the regular season was extended to 17 games, and it certainly feels shorter, too, given that once-mundane calendar entries, such as the start of off-season workouts, are now treated like red-carpet events.
Yet the down time between last season and this one is still long enough that impactful free-agent signings, un-retirements and rules changes made months ago have receded to the background. Here’s our refresher on the N.F.L. happenings to keep in mind as the regular season begins in earnest on Sunday.
Damar Hamlin is back.
Eight months after Hamlin, a Buffalo Bills safety, went into cardiac arrest during a “Monday Night Football” game, he made the team’s 53-man roster and will backup starters Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. Hamlin spent nearly a week in the intensive care unit of a Cincinnati hospital after he collapsed on the field following a collision during a Jan. 2 game against the Bengals. He was then transferred to a hospital in Buffalo.
He steadily passed checkpoints during the off-season, from being cleared to resume football activities in April to playing in his first game since the life-threatening medical event, an exhibition in August. “I made the choice that I wanted to play,” Hamlin, 25, told reporters afterward, adding that he won’t have any hesitation when he’s on the field. Buffalo’s Week 1 game is a return to “Monday Night Football,” against the Jets in East Rutherford, N.J.

Eric Bieniemy left Kansas City for Washington.
After a decade working under Coach Andy Reid in Kansas City, first as the running backs coach and then as the offensive coordinator, Bieniemy is forging out for Washington, where he’s the Commanders’ sole offensive play-caller as well as an assistant head coach. Bieniemy worked with Reid to develop and run the league’s most exciting offense, helmed by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, as the team won two Super Bowl rings in the past four seasons. But also during that time frame, Bieniemy interviewed for more than a dozen N.F.L. head-coaching jobs without receiving any offers.
In Washington, he has the chance to run an offense away from Reid’s shadow. The transition hasn’t been entirely smooth: Commanders Coach Ron Rivera said last month that some players were “concerned” with Bieniemy’s intense coaching style, before Rivera apologized for putting “my foot in my mouth.” Some intensity is clearly needed, as Bieniemy has been tasked with reviving an offense that has perennially ranked near the bottom of the league.

Tua Tagovailoa, who sustained two documented concussions last season, said he contemplated retirement after three N.F.L. seasons.

Tua Tagovailoa didn’t retire.
After Tagovailoa, the Miami Dolphins’ starting quarterback, sustained two diagnosed concussions during the 2022 season, he admitted in an April news conference that he considered retirement before concluding that he was not ready to walk away from football at age 25.
The N.F.L. modified its concussion protocol last season after an investigation into how doctors handled Tagovailoa’s return to the field following a hard hit to the head in a game last September. Four days later, he again hit his head in another game and was taken to the hospital, and Tagovailoa then suffered his second diagnosed concussion on Christmas Day, sidelining him for the rest of the season. Tagovailoa said he took up jiu-jitsu this off-season to learn how to protect his body when he falls, an approach unproven to prevent head injury.

‘Thursday Night Football’ games can be flexed.
In another example of how the pursuit of media money shapes sports leagues, N.F.L. owners approved in May a resolution to bring flex scheduling to “Thursday Night Football” on a limited basis, for now. The rule will allow the league to move no more than two games from Sunday afternoon to Amazon’s Thursday night broadcast. The league can only make those swaps of games scheduled between Weeks 13 and 17 and has to provide at least four weeks’ notice.
The Giants co-owner John Mara spoke out against the change, suggesting that it wasn’t in the best interests of players or fans, but the measure got enough votes from other team owners to pass for a one-season trial.

Brian Flores’s lawsuit against the N.F.L. and its teams is proceeding through the legal system as he coaches in the league.

Brian Flores is calling the Vikings’ defense.
After spending last season as a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach for Pittsburgh, Flores will call defensive plays for the Minnesota Vikings. A judge ruled in March that Flores’s racial discrimination lawsuit against the N.F.L. and its teams can proceed through the judicial system rather than being moved behind closed doors in private arbitration. Flores, who is Black and of Honduran descent, filed suit in February 2022, accusing the league and its teams of discriminating against him and other coaches of color in its hiring practices.
Players can fair catch kickoffs.
In the latest rule change addressing plays that have been found to be the most dangerous, the N.F.L. this season will allow players to call for fair catches on kickoffs and on free kicks after a safety. If a player makes a fair catch behind their team’s 25-yard line, the ball will then be placed at the 25, mirroring the rule that has been used in college games since 2018.
The league expects the return rate, and thus the number of concussions sustained on returns, to decrease as a result of this change, which will be evaluated and considered for permanent adoption after the season.

Ten players are serving gambling suspensions.
Widespread legalized sports betting in the United States has become increasingly entwined with the N.F.L., even as the league in the past year delivered its most extensive set of penalties for violations of its gambling policy. Ten players are currently serving suspensions, ranging from six-game penalties for betting on other sports while at team facilities to indefinite suspensions for betting on N.F.L. games.
The N.F.L. has asked the public to take its word that no games were compromised, while critics have pointed out the dissonance between the league’s stringent penalties and its growing partnerships with betting companies.

Since joining the Broncos, Coach Sean Payton has criticized his predecessor, Nathaniel Hackett, and challenged his veteran quarterback, Russell Wilson.

Sean Payton is back.
Given the myriad ways Payton has made his presence known, such as by saying that Nathaniel Hackett’s term with the Denver Broncos, in which he did not make it through a full season, was “one of the worst coaching jobs in the history of the N.F.L.,” it’s unlikely Payton is off anyone’s radar.
But it is easy to forget that just a year ago, he spent Sundays sitting on the Fox Sports set as a commentator, having “retired” after 15 seasons leading the New Orleans Saints.
His run with the Saints, which included one Super Bowl ring, overlapped with that of quarterback Drew Brees. Now, Payton has perhaps the toughest challenge of his career: rehabilitating Russell Wilson. His approach has been hard-charging, starting with his proclamation at his introductory news conference in Denver that, unlike last season, Wilson’s personal performance coaches would not be allowed in the team facility.
Odell Beckham Jr. is part of the Ravens’ new-look offense.
After spending the 2022 season out of the league while recovering from a knee injury he sustained in Super Bowl LVI, Beckham signed with the Ravens in early April. He joined Baltimore just weeks before the team broke a stalemate with quarterback Lamar Jackson, whom it signed to a five-year, $260 million contract extension.
There’s a good deal of anticipation around the league for how the Ravens’ offense will look. Jackson has a new offensive coordinator, Todd Monken, for the first time since his first full season as an N.F.L. starter. Along with Beckham, the Ravens also added Zay Flowers and Nelson Agholor to a receiver group that had been spotty.

Brock Purdy’s playing through an injury during the N.F.C. championship game in January inspired a rule change that will allow teams to dress a third quarterback on game days.

Teams can use an emergency third quarterback.
The last labor agreement between the N.F.L. and the players’ union expanded game-day rosters to as many as 48 players, up from 46. A new rule put in place this off-season gives teams additional roster flexibility, allowing them to dress a 49th player as an emergency third quarterback. For the player to enter the game, two other quarterbacks on the game-day roster must be unavailable due to injury or disqualification.
The utility for this role came into focus during the N.F.C. championship, when both the San Francisco 49ers’ quarterbacks were injured during the game, forcing the starter Brock Purdy to return after he had injured his throwing elbow. The 49ers lost, 31-7, to the Philadelphia Eagles.
The Super Bowl will be in Las Vegas for the first time.
When the Raiders moved to Las Vegas from Oakland, Calif., in 2020, the team brought with it the possibility of the N.F.L. world descending on The Strip for marquee events, even if the team’s performance of late has kept it far from the league’s biggest games. After hosting two Pro Bowls, Allegiant Stadium will welcome its first Super Bowl this season, though not without caution for players and personnel around the league: New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara is serving a three-game suspension for his role in a fight in Las Vegas on the eve of the 2022 Pro Bowl. And Super Bowl LVIII is sure to be plastered with betting advertisements and partnerships, while the league continues its crackdown on potential violations of its gambling policy by players."
2023-09-11,"The Justice Department argues in a federal antitrust suit that Google is a dominant tech company that has abused its market power to bully industry partners, protect its monopoly and thwart competition.
That has a familiar ring. As U.S. et al. v. Google goes to trial this week, the echoes of the landmark federal suit against Microsoft, a quarter-century ago, are unmistakable. In the Google case, as with Microsoft then, a tech giant is accused of using its overwhelming market power to unfairly cut competitors off from potential customers.
But on the eve of the Google trial, it seems unimaginable that the case could command the widespread attention that the Microsoft proceedings did. Microsoft in the late 1990s was a singular tech titan and its leader, Bill Gates, was a national icon.
The Microsoft trial, which began in October 1998, spanned 76 days of testimony over more than eight months. Every major news organization covered it. The New York Times reported on the proceedings daily.
It was a trial that often dealt with cerebral concepts like “network effects” and “switching costs.” Yet The Times gave it the kind of day-to-day coverage ordinarily reserved for very few courtroom dramas over the years, like the O.J. Simpson trial and the Lindbergh kidnapping trial.
Many days, there were spin sessions on the courthouse steps. Microsoft representatives would say the government had presented isolated snippets of text, taken out of context, certainly not proof of anti-competitive conduct. Lawyers for the Justice Department and states who joined the lawsuit would mostly say the damning testimony spoke for itself.

Olivia Rodrigo just released her second album, “Guts,” which is, at least in some ways, an extension of her 2021 debut album, “Sour.” She plays with similar musical approaches, splitting her time between piano balladry and punkish pop-rock. (She is still working with the same producer, Daniel Nigro.)
But in other ways, it’s an evolution. Before, she was a young performer just out of the Disney ecosystem singing about teen heartbreak. Now, she’s got two years of pop stardom under her belt, and she’s experienced all of the lows that come with fame (and presumably some of the highs, too). That exposure has deepened her songwriting, and made her a prominent pop skeptic operating in the heat of the spotlight.
On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about Rodrigo’s rapid rise, and the ways in which she’s chosen to reflect on it in her songs; her playfulness with genre and vocal style; and the potential futures in front of her.
Guests:
Caryn Ganz, The New York Times’s pop music editor

‘Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake’
When to watch: Now, on Max.
This new spinoff of “Adventure Time” is a reintroduction to the franchise’s magical realms and enchanting sense of humor. It’s also a gender-flipped version of the original: Finn is now Fionna, and Jake the Dog is now Cake the Cat. If diving into the ocean of “Adventure Time” feels like too big an undertaking — 10 seasons, another spinoff, video games, more lore than some religions — dip your toes in with “Fionna,” which is set in the same world and revisits some of its characters but is also a smooth on-ramp for new viewers. If you want something droll and dreamy, and absolutely packed with surprising one-liners, watch this. Six episodes are available now, and two new episodes arrive on the next two Thursdays.

‘The Gold’
When to watch: Begins Sunday, on Paramount+.
This six-part mini-series is based on the true story of a London robbery gone sideways: In 1983, gunmen set out to steal a bunch of cash but wound up stealing £26 million of gold bullion. Then they had to figure out how to launder it — smelting fans to the front! — and eventually the cache injected an awful lot of money into both the legal and illegal economies. The chemistry and banter among characters is sharper and livelier than in your typical chase-the-bad-guys show. Sure, each character eventually delivers a grandiose monologue about the British class system, but “The Gold” has a real pep in its step.
If you like when a lower-class British woman animatedly holds a cigarette and explains to her doofus lowlife boyfriend how crimes work, while the sun streams into a dingy kitchen, this is for you. The first two episodes arrive Sunday and then weekly after that.

Now they’re setting out on a romantic road trip through some national parks to heal their relationship wounds, but Liv has different plans for all those cliffside vistas — and those plans get even wilder when the other woman shows up on a hiking trip of her own. If you want something like “You” or diet “Gone Girl,” but digestible enough for the recently concussed, try this."
2023-09-15,"Anyone whose credit score has been marred by late payments or financial stumbles can understand the allure of a quick fix that scrubs tarnished credit. But beware the companies that sell credit “repair” services over the phone and charge fees upfront.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reached a $2.7 billion settlement in August with PGX Holdings, a group of companies, including Progrexion Marketing, that ran a large credit repair operation under brands like Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com.
Credit repair companies typically bombard credit bureaus with dispute letters in the hope of getting negative marks deleted, said Andrew Pizor, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. (The bureaus can ignore disputes that don’t come directly from consumers, he said.) Occasionally, the repair companies’ efforts may work, Mr. Pizor said, but any benefit is often temporary. If you’ve stopped repaying a loan, that information will reappear on your report when the lender sends an update to the credit bureau.
If the negative information is accurate, there’s generally no way to have it erased, Mr. Pizor said. Negative information like missed or late payments remains on your credit report for seven years, he said, and a personal bankruptcy stays there for 10 years. Paying for credit repair, he said, is “really a waste of money for the vast majority of people.”

Consumers have the right to dispute mistakes on their credit reports and to have the errors corrected promptly — though it can sometimes be frustrating. “Our view is that people shouldn’t need to pay a third party,” said Jonah Kaplan, senior program manager of consumer reporting markets at the consumer bureau. “They can do it for themselves for free.”
The consumer bureau’s settlement stems from a lawsuit that the bureau filed in Federal District Court in Utah, claiming that the companies collected illegal upfront fees for credit repair services sold via telemarketing in violation of federal law. Credit repair companies can’t ask for or receive fees until six months after they have achieved results for the customer, the bureau said. In March, the court ruled in the bureau’s favor.
It’s uncertain how much money consumers will see from the settlement. PGX Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in June. The consumer bureau, in a statement about the settlement, said the victims’ relief fund at the agency could possibly be used to make payments “to those harmed by the perpetrators.”
As part of the settlement, the companies were barred from telemarketing credit repair services for 10 years and must notify customers of the settlement and explain the process for canceling the service.
Eric M. Kamerath, a spokesman for PGX Holdings, said the company “will continue to comply with the court’s ruling while helping consumers who would otherwise live with inaccurate and unsubstantiated credit reports.”

The settlement is the latest salvo in the bureau’s crackdown on credit repair outfits. In a statement, its director, Rohit Chopra, called credit repair companies a “scam.” The Federal Trade Commission has also taken action recently against them.
As delinquencies on credit card debt have risen to prepandemic levels, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling has seen a “steady increase” in demand for credit counseling services since the spring of 2022, said Bruce McClary, a spokesman for the foundation. According to reports from its member agencies, he said, both counseling activity and enrollment in debt-management plans have returned to prepandemic levels.
Some background: The three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — compile details about your payment history into credit reports. They provide the reports to banks, lenders and other companies, which use them to decide if you’re a good credit risk. If you fall behind or stop paying a debt, that shows up on your reports and hurts your credit score — a three-digit summary of your credit record — making it harder to qualify for new loans at favorable rates.
If you’re having trouble repaying your debt and your credit is suffering, one alternative is to seek advice from a nonprofit consumer credit counseling agency, Mr. Pizor of the National Consumer Law Center said. Such groups can assess your financial situation and, if you qualify, arrange for a debt management plan, which will allow you to pay off your debts over time, typically in three to five years. Some agencies may charge a fee, which is offset by a lower interest rate negotiated by the agency.
Research on borrowers who took advantage of payment pauses from their credit card companies during the pandemic and then enrolled in nonprofit debt-management plans were significantly less likely to default than similar borrowers who did not participate in such plans, said David Silberman, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsible Lending.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But he said consumers should be skeptical of debt “settlement” companies because they typically encouraged consumers to stop paying their lenders. Instead, borrowers send money to the settlement company, which aims to use the funds to prod the lender into settling by accepting less money than is owed. (The company takes a cut.)
But if the effort isn’t successful, customers can end up with poorer credit than when they started, Mr. Silberman said. “They’ve dug a deeper hole,” he added.
If a credit counseling firm doesn’t think you earn enough to pay off your debts in a reasonable amount of time, personal bankruptcy — a legal proceeding for getting relief from debts you can’t pay — may be an option. That is a serious step, however, because it may be difficult to gain access to credit for years afterward.
Here are some questions and answers about managing debt:
How can I find a reputable credit counseling agency?
You can search online at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Also, the Justice Department maintains a list of agencies that are approved to provide pre-bankruptcy counseling. These groups often offer other services, including credit counseling and debt-management plans.
Are there credit cards and loans that can help bolster my credit?
Some banks and credit unions offer secured credit cards, which allow users to make a refundable cash deposit — usually a few hundred dollars — that serves as collateral for purchases made with the card. Eventually, cardholders can build a repayment record that improves their credit score, allowing them to advance to a traditional card with a higher borrowing limit. Discover and Amazon are also among those offering secured cards.
Another option may be a “credit builder” loan, offered by community banks as well as online lenders. With credit builder loans, the lender typically deposits your money into a separate savings account. You get the money — usually minus a fee — after you make monthly installments equal to the original amount.

What’s the best way to protect my credit score?
Paying bills on time and keeping your use of credit low — meaning not maxing out your cards — can help maintain a good score. You should also check your credit reports for errors. You can get reports free from the big bureaus — as often as weekly through the end of this year — at a special website, www.annualcreditreport.com."

2023-09-18,"For decades, Casey Wasserman has insisted that he would never enter the traditional entertainment business. Film and TV felt too incestuous — his grandfather Lew Wasserman reigned as Hollywood’s power broker from the 1960s to the 1990s — and too financially challenged, he would say.
Never say never: Mr. Wasserman, 49, announced on Monday that his sports-centered conglomerate, Wasserman, had completed a deal to buy Brillstein Entertainment Partners, a Hollywood management firm and content production company. Terms were not disclosed.
Brillstein represents stars like Brad Pitt, Tiffany Haddish, Adam Sandler, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Elizabeth Olsen. The firm also represents digital creators, podcasters and professional video game players. Brillstein, which landed a major hit in 1999 with “The Sopranos” and has a hand in “Real Time With Bill Maher,” recently signed a first-look deal with Paramount Television Studios and has projects in the works at Netflix, Disney and Amazon.
What changed Mr. Wasserman’s mind?
“The media business is radically different than it was even five years ago, and that frankly requires us to think differently about how we represent sports and music talent,” he said. “Musicians are on TikTok and athletes are on YouTube and people want to produce documentaries. The lines have blurred a lot more than I think anyone would have expected even five years ago.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
He continued, “Athletes used to monetize themselves in sports, musicians in music, entertainment in entertainment space, and those lines are gone.”
Wasserman, founded in 2002 as the Wasserman Media Group, has become one of the largest sports representation and marketing agencies in the world. After a failed expansion into the management of musicians in the early 2000s, Wasserman tried again in recent years and now has a large music division, representing artists and bands like Billie Eilish, Brandi Carlile, Drake and Coldplay.
Mr. Wasserman said he intended to expand Brillstein’s television and film production business, perhaps by acquiring additional film and television companies. “We want to get this first step right,” he said. “But this is a first step, not a last step.”
Brillstein was founded in 1969 by Bernie Brillstein, a garrulous talent manager who died in 2008. With early clients like Lorne Michaels and Jim Henson, Mr. Brillstein built his firm into one of Hollywood’s leading management companies. His business model — managing stars and helping to produce television shows and movies for them — attracted competitors, some of which (Anonymous Content, 3 Arts Entertainment) would eventually surpass Brillstein in size.
Jon Liebman, Brillstein’s co-chief executive, said that Wasserman would provide the resources needed to expand, particularly in content production. “The business has become incredibly complex,” Mr. Liebman said. “The days when a manager could effectively serve clients without being plugged into a larger organization are over.”"
2023-09-19,"Sports continues to make its march to streaming.
Warner Bros. Discovery announced on Tuesday that it would begin adding live sporting events from the company’s cable networks to the Max streaming service in October. The streaming service will now include access to Major League Baseball playoff games, as well as regular-season games from the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League.
For several months, the sporting events will be free for all Max subscribers. But in late February — just as college basketball’s March Madness is about to get underway, and several weeks before professional basketball and hockey playoffs begin — access to the games will cost $10 a month on top of the standard Max subscription price, the company said. Currently, Max without commercials costs $16 a month, and the advertising-supported plan is $10 a month.
Media companies are racing to figure out how to fold in live sporting events with their popular but still cash-bleeding streaming services. The rights to the sporting events are often expensive, and are one of the last main drivers to broadcast and cable channels. (Warner Bros. Discovery carries live sports on its Turner cable networks.)
Recently, Charter Communications subscribers temporarily lost access to Disney’s cable networks, including ESPN, in a highly publicized dispute. Charter executives argued that Disney sought too much additional money for its cable networks even though its priority was its streaming business.
Disney has signaled that ESPN will, at some point, be available to customers via streaming without a cable subscription. The dispute with Charter was settled this month.
Other media companies are providing access to marquee sporting events on their streaming services at no additional charge. Paramount offers football games through its streaming service, Paramount+. Peacock will stream a wild-card N.F.L. playoff game early next year that will not be available on a cable or broadcast network. Amazon likewise has rights to “Thursday Night Football” at no additional charge to Prime Video.

2023-09-21,"BLOOD IN THE MACHINE: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech, by Brian Merchant
Revolutions inevitably birth counterrevolutions. The Industrial Revolution was no exception. In the early 19th century, textile workers in the north of England, set on a course toward obsolescence by new machines, struck back. Under the banner of a mythical apprentice named “Ned Ludd,” they staged nightly factory raids, using massive hammers to smash machines and forcing the British government to place the entire region under military occupation. Ever since, the Luddite movement has spawned mythologies of its own, drawing in writers attracted to its doomed Romantic broadsides against modernity, and its status as a militant workers’ movement erupting at the dawn of industrial capitalism.
Brian Merchant is something of an oddity in this pantheon of writers, which includes the eminent historians Eric Hobsbawm and E.P. Thompson and the firebrand activist Kirkpatrick Sale. Merchant is the tech columnist at The Los Angeles Times and the author of a history of the iPhone; and though the bulk of his new book, “Blood in the Machine,” is derived from an immense trove of archival materials and secondary historical sources, he brings a journalist’s touch to the Luddites’ travails, drawing connections between the conflicts and indignities of their epoch and our own.
The book is structured around the stories of the individuals, famous and otherwise, whose lives were violently unsettled by technological change in this auspicious time: the Prince Regent (the future King George IV), whose decadent revelries provided a foil to the weavers’ escalating privation; Lord Byron, the infamous Lothario whose populist defenses of the working class helped bring about his celebrity; Robert Blincoe, the orphan whose brutal experiences in a cotton factory from the age of 7 likely inspired Charles Dickens’s character Oliver Twist. Most central is the story of George Mellor, a brawny and charismatic cropper who leads Luddite cadres into increasingly daring actions, which culminate in the vengeful assassination of a notoriously cruel millowner and the subsequent unraveling of the movement.
Merchant capably situates the Luddite story within its historical context, but, like his forebears, he uses the past as a lens onto the present. Thompson’s Luddites entered debates on political consciousness in the 1960s; Sale deployed them to lend urgency to environmental politics in the de-radicalized 1990s. Today’s Luddish writers (myself included) invoke the Luddites to tarnish the shiny facades of Silicon Valley apps as they remake our world — particularly as they reconfigure decent jobs into hyper-surveilled and algorithmically managed gigs. Merchant memorably describes the typical such platform (Amazon, Uber, Instacart) as a “psychic factory” that “cyborgizes its workers for maximum productivity.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
To make the book’s political stakes even plainer, Merchant renders the early 19th century in current-day language. Factory owners are “entrepreneurs,” “the one percent,” even “tech titans” who are “disrupting” the textile industry — moving fast and breaking things, to borrow Facebook’s old slogan. Factory technologies spread “virally” and represent a form of “automation” (a term, as Merchant notes, that was not coined until the 1940s). The Luddites themselves are likened to decentralized movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter. In the book’s final section, Merchant shifts back into a journalistic register, interviewing labor lawyers, analysts and workers struggling against the worst abuses of the gig economy. Chris Smalls, the magnetic warehouse employee who led the first successful unionization drive at Amazon last year, emerges as our era’s nearest analogue to Mellor.
Luddite histories are not just political, but almost always corrective. Today the term “Luddite” is divorced from the context of labor struggle, and instead signifies an irrational technophobia or a stubborn adherence to older ways. You might be a Luddite if you prefer to pay in cash, or if you think smartphones have ushered in the downfall of society. As Merchant argues, this is a holdover from how the elites of the day depicted the weavers’ struggles, as tantrums against technology. In fact, machine breaking was not a raison d’être for the Luddites, but a last resort when appeals to law, custom and morality fell on the deaf ears of authorities. If smashing a stocking frame became the signature Luddite action, it was because it got the goods, so to speak: Many millowners submitted to Luddite demands on pay and working conditions rather than risk their machines — or their lives.
Merchant is keen to reframe the Luddites as proto-unionist reformers rather than violent revolutionaries. Mellor’s story ends with a letter from his prison cell, where he awaits his execution, requesting that his name be added to a petition calling for restrictions on machines. In Merchant’s account, gig economy workers and their advocates focus on regulation and fair treatment, never sabotage. It is not an unfair conclusion to draw: No American worker movements approach the militancy of the Luddites during their raids, and President Biden’s ear bends more readily than that of the Prince Regent. But if we truly want to break from the future that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have planned for us, with our blood in their machines, it could take more than legislation to do so. It might require a few hammers.

BLOOD IN THE MACHINE: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech | By Brian Merchant | Illustrated | 465 pp. | Little, Brown & Company | $30"
2023-09-22,"“Design and craft are, for the most part, completely foreign to me,” says the Mexican actor and producer Gael García Bernal, 44. But when he encountered the work of the 39-year-old Mexico City-based ceramist Perla Valtierra, he felt an immediate connection. Combining a traditional Mexican aesthetic and materials with a Japanese-influenced perspective — Valtierra lived and studied in Kyoto and counts the writings of Soetsu Yanagi, the founder of the Mingei folk-art movement, as a prime source of inspiration — her pieces are known for their undulating accents and understated palettes. Improbably delicate loops of ribboned clay trace the edges of vases; graceful, swooping scallops circle the rims of plates and bowls. To García Bernal, the sinuous shapes conjure the spiraling plumes of the steam trains he was fascinated by as a child visiting relatives in northwestern Mexico. “What touches me most is not when I discover something but instead recognize it,” he says. “That’s what happened when I saw her work: I was very eager to meet her.”
On an unusually hot morning in June, García Bernal arrived at Valtierra’s showroom, tucked among other art spaces inside the Fundación Marso building, a grand 19th-century Porfirian-style house in Mexico City’s Colonia Juárez. There, surrounded by glazed candlesticks, textured glass vases and earthenware vessels of various shapes and sizes, the two discovered they had more in common than just an appreciation for curves.
García Bernal, who started acting as a child, appears as the pioneering gay lucha libre wrestler Saúl Armendáriz in the biopic “Cassandro,” which is currently in theaters and on Amazon Prime Video. Twenty or so years ago, with films like Alfonso Cuarón’s “Y Tu Mamá También” (2001) and Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Amores Perros” (2000), he became the face of a Mexican cinema renaissance. Since then, he’s collaborated with such filmmakers as Pedro Almodóvar, Michel Gondry and Walter Salles. The new film, directed and co-written by Roger Ross Williams, tells the story of Armendáriz’s 1990 rise to stardom as an exótico, a male wrestler who dresses in drag and often taunts his straight opponents with flirtatious advances. Valtierra, who was raised in the northern state of Chihuahua and established her business 13 years ago after beginning her career as an industrial designer, is now, like García Bernal, finding herself in the unanticipated role of cultural ambassador, with her wares at the forefront of a contemporary Mexican design wave. Her line is not only used at many of the restaurants and boutiques that fill the city’s Condesa and Roma neighborhoods but is also sold at influential interiors shops around the world, including Nickey Kehoe in Los Angeles, Roman and Williams Guild in New York and Ott in Seoul.
Despite these successes, both artists approach their art with a sense of naïveté. Even though Valtierra runs a brand that works with 15 artisans, she says she likes to think of herself as an “apprentice of ceramics.” And García Bernal recently told the Spanish newspaper El País that, after more than 30 years in the business, he still feels like he could abandon filmmaking and do something else. Each has lived abroad — Valtierra in Paris and Brussels, in addition to Kyoto, and García Bernal in Madrid and Buenos Aires, where he continues to reside part time — and both returned home with changed perspectives regarding their country. As they sat down over coffee and Topo Chico water, weeks before the actors’ strike began, they chatted about their creative processes, career motivations and what makes a work of art uniquely Mexican.

2023-09-24,"If you had suddenly been blindfolded and transported to Dahlia, a cocktail lounge that opened in May at the Downtown Proper hotel in Los Angeles, you might have asked yourself: Where in the world am I?
The high walls are painted dusty rose, and the booth cushions are upholstered in velvety brown, like the desert floor after rain. Artworks in a terra-cotta palette cover the walls, including a bulbous wicker sculpture that looked somewhat suggestive, like one of Georgia O’Keeffe’s abstract flowers.
There was a sweating glass bottle of Mexican mineral water on a table, along with a small plate of lime wedges so fat and juicy that they seemed otherworldly.
Had you been dropped into a boutique hotel bar in San Miguel de Allende? Sedona? Santa Fe?
The answer might not have become any clearer when Kelly Wearstler, the woman who designed the bar and the hotel, walked through the stained-glass doors. She was dressed in oversize denim from head to the pointed toes of her leather Loewe ankle boots, which had a built-in denim cuff folded over the shaft. When she spoke, it was with a slight Southern twang.

“Oh, can you still hear the accent?” asked Ms. Wearstler, 55, who was born and raised in South Carolina before moving to Massachusetts for college.
Not long after she graduated, she moved to Los Angeles, where she has lived for 30 years. Jobs as a waitress and onetime Playboy model aside, she has spent most of that time designing decadent homes, high-end hotels and idiosyncratic objects to decorate them, like marble sofas, chunky credenzas and lamps covered in spore-like spheres.
She has also become one of the world’s most famous interior designers. She has 2.1 million followers on Instagram, where she often shares her work alongside photos of herself wearing outré clothes. (Riding a public bike in Paris in knee-high Givenchy boots, for instance, or balancing in Loewe’s deflated balloon heels while potting plants in her living room.) Each post has its own magazine-style caption, and some are sponsored.
She judged a Bravo reality show called “Top Design” in the mid-2000s. She has a MasterClass. This summer, she appeared on the covers of Harper’s Bazaar’s Netherlands and Architectural Digest China. Her sixth book, “Synchronicity,” will be published on Sept. 26, and it includes glossy photographs of her hotel projects, among others. Her last book, “Evocative Style,” came out in 2019 and is on Amazon’s list of best-selling interior and home design books.

Lena Wald, a friend of about 20 years and a jewelry designer in Los Angeles, said that when she was recently in Paris with Ms. Wearstler, a group of Korean design students approached her outside the Palais-Royal. They had studied Ms. Wearstler’s work in school.

Ms. Wald, who declined to give her age — “I’m a few years younger than Kelly,” she said — also recalled being stopped by Ms. Wearstler’s fans when they were at the Round Top Antiques Show in Texas. During an interview with Ms. Wearstler in August at the Santa Monica Proper hotel, where she also designed the interiors, two people approached her within 10 minutes to introduce themselves and hand her business cards.
Although Ms. Wearstler has been recognized for her decorating style, it can be hard to define. She likes to combine pieces with dissimilar textures, layering them like a design lasagna. When she first rose to prominence in the 2000s, journalists described the look as Hollywood Regency or maximalist. (Her clients then included the singer Gwen Stefani and the restaurant at Bergdorf Goodman.) The word “eclectic” is often applied to Ms. Wearstler’s work; “that one drives me crazy,” she said.
The Proper hotel in Downtown Los Angeles — a neighborhood that has struggled as the city’s homelessness crisis has accelerated — is a place to eat Iberian-inspired food on Mexican-made furniture. Work by local contemporary artists is mixed with flea-market finds, and upstairs, in homage to the building’s past life as a Y.W.C.A., there is a suite with a private indoor pool stretching beneath a grand ivory ceramic mural. It starts at about $4,800 per night.
In suites like that, about half of the décor is vintage and half is new, a combination that is essential to Ms. Wearstler. “A philosophy of mine is: Old soul, new spirit,” she said. “It’s how I dress. It’s how I design.”
Heart and Soul
Ms. Wearstler uses the word “soul” often.
On a recent tour of the Downtown Proper hotel, which opened in 2021, she said that some walls were given plaster treatment to “feel more soulful.” A mirror shaped like a mushroom “adds so much heart and soul” to a bathroom, she said, compared with a non-mushroom-shaped mirror.

Later, as she climbed into her matte Lamborghini S.U.V. and drove to her nearby storage warehouse, she began to describe her sensibility with another word: “love.”
“Literally everything goes back to love,” Ms. Wearstler said, walking through tall aisles between shelves stuffed with plastic-wrapped and boxed décor she has been collecting for more than 20 years. Some of it she had commissioned, or produced through her studio in West Hollywood. Other pieces were found at antiques malls or bought from galleries around the world.
There was a vintage tapestry from London that she has owned since before her 2002 wedding to Brad Korzen, a founder and the chief executive of the Kor Group, a real-estate-investment firm, and of Proper Hospitality, which operates the Proper hotels. (There are four, all designed by Ms. Wearstler.) There was a mirror with a goopy, puffy metallic frame by the artist Amelia Briggs.
How does Ms. Wearstler choose these pieces? “You just fall in love,” she said. “That’s what design and life is about: Falling in love. That amazing warm feeling that’s in your soul.”
When asked to describe what seemed to be a quintessential Kelly Wearstler piece at her warehouse — a large bronze bowl with nine long cylindrical legs unevenly spaced around its base — she said, “I just love things that have repetition. I like things that have weight and permanence and are sculptural.”

But when it came to defining her style, she resisted labeling it. Instead, she said, “I’m constantly moving forward and pushing myself — I don’t want to repeat myself.”
“As a designer, I’m a free spirit,” she said. “It’s like a moving target.”
Amy Astley, the editor of Architectural Digest, said that it was hard to capture Ms. Wearstler’s aesthetic in a short pithy phrase. “But I do think she’s a master of jolie-laide,” or finding beauty in the unconventional or strange, she said.
The dominant style in American interiors right now, according to Ms. Astley, is “a clean oatmeal look,” which is not quite minimalist but formulaically spare. Living rooms are light and bright with a big statement sofa or coffee table.
Ms. Wearstler uses “weighty, hefty, juicy, meaty kinds of shapes — like in her chairs or in her sofas — and there’s a real masculinity to her work,” Ms. Astley said. “The colors are the opposite of girlie.”
Lately, Ms. Astley said, Ms. Wearstler’s most influential interiors have been designed for places like hotels and with a low-slung 1970s vibe. “It’s slouchy, it’s sexy, it’s relaxed, and it’s cool,” she said.
David Alhadeff, the founder of the Future Perfect gallery, where Ms. Wearstler has acquired contemporary pieces from artists including Eric Roinestad and Chris Wolston, said Ms. Wearstler has a confident eye.

“She buys something because she’s passionate about it,” he said. “She is emotionally drawn toward the work.”
On ‘Synchronicity’
In recent years, Ms. Wearstler has taken on a number of unconventional projects, like designing a techno brutalist-meets-midcentury-modern garage for an electric Hummer ad.
Her more conventional endeavors have included designing a full tabletop collection — her first — in collaboration with Serax, a Belgian décor brand, which was released in August.
At her studio, where she has about 50 employees, she is working on the conversion of the former Cal Neva Lodge and Casino in Lake Tahoe into the next Proper hotel. Cal Neva was once owned by Frank Sinatra.
“We’re going to make it sexy and cool,” Ms. Wearstler said of the casino floor. Such spaces, she added, are generally “not cool.” There will be game tables, but no slot machines, she said: “It will be something like you would see in Monaco.”
Toward the end of last year, Ms. Wearstler began looking into artificial intelligence after the release of ChatGPT’s public chatbot. A handful of her employees are working on how to incorporate A.I. into the studio’s work.

So far, it’s a brainstorming tool. On a Friday afternoon in August, Tulika Lokapur, an interior designer at Ms. Wearstler’s studio, showed how the technology is being used. Ms. Lokapur prompted a chatbot to “imagine a library with blackened steel shelving in Lake Tahoe,” then uploaded two images to guide the A.I. toward the right style.
Ms. Wearstler compared using A.I. to having a junior designer scour old design books for inspiration — like a new team member pitching ideas.
“You’re still being creative,” said Ms. Wearstler, who is aware that there is pushback to using A.I. in creative fields. “You still have to know design history and style. It’s very important, because how are you prompting if you don’t?”
Ms. Lokapur, 33, said, “We’re also very cautious of how we’re using it and the message that we’re sending with it.”
This future feels far from Ms. Wearstler’s beginnings, which she described as modest. She went to the Massachusetts College of Art and Design to study graphic design, after developing a passion for collecting old fashion magazines as a teenager. “Myrtle Beach is not a cultural place,” she said of her hometown in South Carolina. “It was my escape.”

At college, she became fascinated while watching a “cute guy” build 3-D models in an open studio one day, she said. She began taking architecture classes, and decided to “meet in the middle and do interior design,” as she put it.
She then took an apprenticeship in New York with the designer Milton Glaser, of “I ♥ New York” fame, but found herself drawn to Los Angeles, in part for its proximity to the ocean. Her first interior design job came when a friend introduced her to a couple who wanted help with their Venice bungalow. She filled it with vintage furniture she found at the Rose Bowl and other markets.
At the time, she was working as a waitress. Within about three years of decorating that Venice house, she had started an interior-design studio and stopped working in restaurants to run it full-time.
Home Life
At the start of her career, Ms. Wearstler said, work was her priority, over having children. But while engaged to Mr. Korzen, she became pregnant with her oldest son, Oliver, now 21. Soon after, they had second son, Elliott, now 20. Though both pregnancies were difficult, she said, she loved having a family. Years later, she still wanted another baby.
“Probably 30 to 40 percent of our friends had gotten divorced and remarried, and they were having kids,” she said. “Why can’t we do it?”
“I feel, like, 20 years old,” she added.

The couple’s third son, Crosby, was born by surrogate last September. They learned their surrogate’s water had broken while Ms. Wearstler was hosting a pool party at their home in Beverly Hills, a palatial estate built in 1926 that she refers to as the Broccoli house. (It is nicknamed for its previous occupant, Albert Broccoli, a producer of James Bond films.)
It was about seven weeks before Crosby’s due date. “We freaked out,” Ms. Wearstler said. They slipped out of the party and drove to a hospital outside Santa Barbara.
At that point, they had told only a small number of family members and friends about their choice to have Crosby, who was born two weeks later.
“You want to keep it private, and then when the baby comes, you celebrate,” Ms. Wearstler said, citing other women in their 50s who have chosen surrogacy, like the supermodel Naomi Campbell. “It’s been like a rebirth for our family.”
Ms. Wearstler hosts a play group twice a week at her home for babies and their mothers or nannies, most of them women in their 30s. Some are the younger second wives of men who already have children the same age as Ms. Wearstler’s older sons. “I’m the anomaly,” she said. “But I’m fine with it.”
Though the manicured mansion is the family’s main residence, they occasionally rent it out for brand events. During the Oscars, Versace removed some of Ms. Wearstler’s modern furniture to display several archival couture gowns. The magazine Racquet has hosted a party on the sunken tennis court.

While the home is opulent — there is a glass-enclosed Padel court and marijuana- and oregano-scented Loewe hand soap stocked in a bathroom — it also feels like a place where people live. And eat: Ms. Wearstler, who grazed on a snack platter she had prepared on a Saturday afternoon in August, seemed to have expanded her diet since telling Bon Appétit in a 2013 interview that, with the exception of dinner, she mostly drank juice all day.
That weekend, she and Mr. Korzen, 59, swam and hung out at home with their many boys: Oliver and Elliott, both students at the University of Texas at Austin, who were preparing to return to campus; Crosby, fussy after a nap; and the family’s two rescue dogs, Javier and the distinctive Willie, who, with more than 12,000 Instagram followers, has also achieved a modicum of fame.
Call it the Kelly Wearstler effect. As her friend Ms. Wald put it: “She’s more of a celebrity now — not just a designer.”"

Striking screenwriters and Hollywood studios have negotiated a tentative deal.

Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times
What we learned from the writers strike
One of the longest-running strikes of 2023 is near an end: The Writers Guild of America reached a tentative agreement on Sunday with Hollywood studios on a new contract, 146 days after its more than 11,000 screenwriters walked out of movie and television productions.
The work stoppage isn’t officially over yet, and actors remain on strike. But hints about what the W.G.A. attained suggest that as organized labor enjoys a surge in popularity across a variety of industries, its muscle-flexing is achieving results.
“We can say, with great pride, that this deal is exceptional,” the W.G.A. told its members on Sunday, though it hasn’t yet disclosed details. News reports suggest the deal includes provisions for residual payments from streaming, minimum staffing of shows and limits on the use of artificial intelligence.
Expect more particulars once the W.G.A. informs its membership ahead of a vote that’s expected on Tuesday. Until then, writers are still on strike, though they’re not actively picketing. Late-night talk shows, which don’t rely on striking actors, are likely to resume production first.

The W.G.A. appears to have won more than analysts initially believed possible. Studios suggested early on that they wouldn’t bend on issues like residuals or staffing, citing changes streaming has made to their industry.
But the strike — coupled with the SAG-AFTRA walkout — has crippled Hollywood, with studio owners like Warner Bros. Discovery predicting big hits to their earnings. Analysts have estimated that studios could lose as much as $1.6 billion in global ticket sales because of movie delays. Shares in Warner Bros. and Paramount Global jumped in premarket trading on Monday morning.
The W.G.A. also benefited from strong public support for unions. A Gallup poll last month found that two-thirds of Americans backed organized labor. Writers enjoyed even more support, at 72 percent. (Studios garnered just 19 percent.)
That could inspire other unions in their own negotiations with management. About 54 percent of Americans support the U.A.W. in its battle with big Detroit automakers, according to a recent Morning Consult poll. In a sign of the political stakes, President Biden will head to the U.A.W. picket line in Michigan tomorrow.
So far, the autoworkers’ group is holding strong, expanding its strike against General Motors and the Jeep owner Stellantis. (It has spared Ford from further walkouts, citing greater progress in talks with that company.)
The risk run by striking unions, of course, is that public sentiment could reverse if their walkouts drag on and economic pain mounts. Consider that California’s economy has lost over $5 billion from the Hollywood shutdown, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom, or that a protracted auto strike could potentially push the U.S. into a recession.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A top Nomura banker is said to be barred from leaving mainland China. Charles Wang Zhonghe, the Japanese bank’s chair of investment banking in China, has been hit by an exit ban in connection with an investigation into Bao Fan, one of China’s top tech dealmakers, according to The Financial Times. The apparent restrictions on Wang, who is based in Hong Kong, come as the confidence of Western businesses operating in China has plunged. Bao hasn’t been seen for months.
Poultry giants are under investigation over work done by migrant children. The Labor Department opened the investigation into Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms after The New York Times Magazine reported that contractors forced children as young as 13 to clean slaughterhouses. The investigation hinges on whether corporations can be considered employers in instances like these.
Sanctions on Russia’s oil exports are reportedly falling short. Russia has been able to sell about three-quarters of its oil above the $60-a-barrel cap set by the Group of Seven, according to The Financial Times, lifting revenues as crude prices soar. The Kremlin announced recently that it would significantly increase spending next year, with a big boost to defense.

The A.I. arms race heats up
Amazon has upped its bet on artificial intelligence, saying on Monday that it will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a start-up founded two years ago that is one of a wave of young companies pulling in big money from big tech.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Amazon will initially invest $1.25 billion for a minority stake. The new valuation of Anthropic hasn’t been determined, according to The Wall Street Journal, but under the terms of the deal, Amazon’s investment could increase. Anthropic will also use the tech giant’s cloud computing platform and its A.I. chips to build its models. (That seems to be a shift, after the start-up said it would use Google’s services to do the same in February.)
Big Tech is piling into the sector. The Amazon-Anthropic deal has echoes of Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, the generative A.I. company behind ChatGPT, and big funding rounds have proliferated across the sector. Other deals include:
Anthropic raised $450 million in a funding round in May that included backing from Google and Salesforce at a valuation of $4 billion.
OpenAI got $1 billion from Microsoft in 2019, and the Windows maker plowed in another $10 billion in January, at a valuation of $29 billion.
Inflection AI, a year-old start-up, pulled in $1.3 billion from Microsoft and the chipmaker Nvidia in June at a valuation of $4 billion.
Databricks, a data analytics company, raised more than $500 million in a funding round that included Nvidia at a valuation of $43 billion this month.
Cohere, a generative A.I. start-up, raised $270 million from Nvidia and others in June at a valuation of $2 billion.
Hugging Face, a software company, raised $235 million last month at a valuation of $4.5 billion, in a round backed by Google, Amazon, IBM, Nvidia and Qualcomm, the chipmaker.
The relationships are about more than money. Mustafa Suleyman, a co-founder of Inflection AI and Google DeepMind, told DealBook this month that Inflection received early access to Nvidia chips, partly to help test and debug them. “In return for early access, we identify failure models, we stress-test them to the max,” he said.
Amazon is playing catch-up in generative A.I. The partnership with Anthropic was announced just days after the e-commerce behemoth said it would apply the latest tech to Alexa, its voice assistant. And all of this is happening as consumer tech giants race to bring A.I. to the masses.
Anticipating the damage from a government shutdown
With a Saturday deadline looming, it’s a make-or-break week in Washington on budget talks. Republicans are no closer to ending their civil war, making a government shutdown more likely and adding volatility to slumping stock and bond markets.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A round of talks over the weekend failed to move the needle. A group of far-right House Republicans are insisting on about $120 billion in budget cuts and plan to block any stopgap spending measures.
While Speaker Kevin McCarthy is weighing a 45-day extension of government spending, holdouts in his party say that’s a nonstarter. “Continuing resolutions don’t solve the problem,” Representative Tony Gonzales of Texas said on Sunday. “They just kick the can down the road.”
Growth fears persist. The Biden administration called on Republicans to resolve their differences, warning that a shutdown would mean federal employees, including members of the military, wouldn’t get paid and that travelers could face disruptions at airports. Goldman Sachs economists have forecast that a shutdown would cut G.D.P. by about 0.2 percentage points per week.
That potential headwind comes as the economy faces a triple threat of soaring oil prices, widespread labor strikes and the resumption of student-loan payments — all of which could sap consumers’ spending power.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Stocks look vulnerable. Equity analysts at RBC Capital Markets, who examined data going back to the 1970s, calculated that extended shutdowns tend to knock as much as 10 percent off the value of the S&P 500. A lengthy shutdown “would take the index a little north of 4,100,” according to Lori Calvasina, the bank’s head of U.S. equity strategy, implying a roughly 5 percent drop from Friday’s market close.
Investors are getting a dose of gridlock déjà vu. Washington barely avoided a federal default in June, but two months later Fitch downgraded the country’s long-term credit rating, citing its ballooning debt and brinkmanship politics. The downgrade took some market watchers by surprise, and added to the doubts hanging over a bond market that’s been hurt by elevated interest rates.
A sell-off in bonds last week pushed the yield on 10-year Treasury notes to a 16-year high, prompting the billionaire investors Bill Ackman and Bill Gross to warn that the rout could persist as the economy faces a host of uncertainties.
“The presidential pot is simmering, and he is happy to stir it.”
— A former colleague of Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor of Virginia and a former top executive at the investment giant Carlyle, on speculation that Youngkin could run for president. A number of Republican megadonors have urged him to do so amid dissatisfaction with both President Biden and Donald Trump.

The week ahead
Inflation data, earnings and more corporate A.I. news: Here’s what to watch for this week.
Tuesday: The Conference Board’s latest survey on consumer confidence and the Case-Shiller report, which details housing affordability, are scheduled for release.
Wednesday: Micron Technology and H&M, the fashion retailer, are set to report earnings. Meta Connect, the annual developers conference held by Facebook’s parent, kicks off, with a focus on the company’s plans for A.I. and the metaverse.
Thursday: Nike and CarMax are set to deliver quarterly results, offering more insight into consumer spending.
Friday: The Commerce Department will publish data on personal consumption expenditures. The closely watched inflation measure is expected to show that “core” P.C.E., which excludes food and energy prices, rose 3.9 percent last month on an annual basis — a stark improvement from a year ago, but still well above the Fed’s target. Across the Atlantic, the latest report on consumer prices in the eurozone is scheduled for release.

2023-09-26,"The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon on Tuesday, setting up a long-awaited antitrust fight with the e-commerce giant that could alter the way Americans shop for everything from toilet paper to electronics online.
The 172-page suit, the federal government’s most significant challenge to the power of the online store, accused Amazon of protecting a monopoly over swaths of online retail by squeezing merchants and favoring its own services.
For consumers, that meant “artificially higher prices” as merchants were blocked from selling their products for less on other sites, and a worse shopping experience as Amazon boosted its own products and peppered its search results with ads, the lawsuit said. The retailer’s tactics made it impossible for its rivals to compete, the agency and states said.
“A single company, Amazon, has seized control over much of the online retail economy,” said the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. “It exploits its monopolies in ways that enrich Amazon but harm its customers: both the tens of millions of American households who regularly shop on Amazon’s online superstore and the hundreds of thousands of businesses who rely on Amazon to reach them.”
The lawsuit put the influence and reach of Amazon, a $1.3 trillion behemoth, squarely in the spotlight after years of mounting scrutiny. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, the onetime upstart online bookseller has grown into a conglomerate with tentacles in retail, Hollywood and the foundational infrastructure of the internet.
Much of the Seattle-based company’s power has emanated from its online marketplace, sometimes known as an “everything store” for the range of products it sells and the speed with which it delivers them. Amazon’s sway over online commerce has shaped the lives of merchants around the world, set the working conditions for more than one million warehouse workers and pushed the Postal Service to deliver on Sundays.

Soon after, she let a ball get by her into the net. Her team lost. “I choked under the pressure of those evaluative eyes on me,” she recounted in a TEDMed talk in 2017.
Impelled in part by that upsetting experience, she went on to earn degrees in cognitive science, psychology and kinesiology. She wrote a book about choking and how to avoid it. And in a career in academic governance, she prioritized students’ mental health. Last Friday she was inaugurated as the first female president of Dartmouth College. In her inaugural address, she stated that wellness would be her first area of focus. “The single greatest service we can do for our students, our faculty and our staff is to support them on their wellness journeys,” she said.
A few days before that address, Beilock was shown some data that confirmed her resolve to focus on wellness. It came from David Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth who has developed an academic specialty in happiness and well-being. Blanchflower shared two charts with me this week and I am now sharing them with you. They are remarkable — and disturbing.
As a preface: There’s a truism in happiness studies that stress and despair peak in middle age; the young and the old are mentally healthier. But the mental health of young people has deteriorated. In February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nearly three in five teenage girls felt persistent sadness in 2021.

What Blanchflower spotted is that the middle-age hump of unhappiness has gone away entirely, with adulthood unhappiness now worst at the very beginning. “This is a completely new thing,” Blanchflower told me.
The data come from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys of the C.D.C. One question asks, “Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?” The percentages in these charts are for people who answered 30 out of 30 — no good days at all. Blanchflower terms that “despair.”"

The list of individual companies that have a meaningful impact on global greenhouse gas emissions is relatively short, and dominated by oil and gas producers. Think Exxon, Shell, Chevron and BP.
But there is another company that belongs in that conversation: JBS, the world’s largest meat producer, which has annual revenues of more than $50 billion. (The name comes from the initials of its founder, José Batista Sobrinho.)
With operations around the globe and a supply chain that reaches deep into ecologically sensitive areas like the Amazon rainforest, JBS is responsible for significant carbon dioxide and methane emissions. One study found that JBS produces more emissions each year than all of Italy, with its total growing by 51 percent between 2016 and 2021. (The company disputes that comparison.)
JBS is already publicly traded in Brazil, where it is based. Now it is pursuing a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, a move that would give JBS expanded access to capital, which it could use to get even bigger. The United States is its largest market.

Environmental activists are trying to block the listing. Last month, Rainforest Action Network, Mighty Earth and World Animal Protection sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing what they say is the company’s shoddy environmental record and a litany of dubious corporate governance practices.
“This evidence all points to a company which has no real plan to decarbonize and is highly selective about what it discloses to mislead investors that the company can continue to grow in an industry where ‘business-as-usual’ practices will not cut it,” wrote Glenn Hurowitz, the chief executive of Mighty Earth.
JBS is working hard to persuade the public, and potential investors, that it is a good corporate citizen. And last week, I interviewed the JBS global chief, executive Gilberto Tomazoni, at the Climate Forward live event in New York. Over the course of 30 minutes, I asked him about JBS’s emissions, the public listing, the criticism from activists and more, while Tomazoni defended the company’s record.
‘Strategic information’
Researchers say that as much as 90 percent of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is linked to the cattle industry. Tropical deforestation for meat production is a double whammy for the climate, replacing biodiverse carbon sinks with clear-cut land full of methane-belching bovines.
JBS is one of the biggest consumers of cattle raised on newly deforested land.
In 2021, an audit led by prosecutors in the Brazilian state of Pará, home to the second-largest cattle herd in the Amazon, found that JBS had bought 301,000 animals, amounting to 32 percent of its purchases in the state, between January 2018 and June 2019 from farms that had violated commitments to prevent illegal deforestation.

A Times investigation found that ranches supplying JBS significantly overlapped Indigenous land, a conservation zone or an area that was deforested after 2008, when laws regulating deforestation were put in place in Brazil.
When I asked Tomazoni what JBS was doing to make sure that the cattle it buys are not coming from newly deforested land, he replied that “this is a big issue and no one can solve it alone.”
He said that JBS had a “zero tolerance deforestation” policy and had cut ties with 16,000 ranchers who were not in compliance. He also called for the creation of a national traceability system that would track individual animals from the ranch to the feedlot to the slaughterhouse.
In a statement, the Brazilian Environment Ministry said that it was already working to create a national monitoring system. It added that companies had a responsibility to trace deforestation links in their own supply chains.

Tomazoni told me that JBS was aiming to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. But as I reminded him, that claim was deemed misleading by the National Advertising Review Board. When I asked Tomazoni why he was repeating the claim, he said: “We are so confident that we are doing the right things.”

A JBS spokeswoman added that the company was using blockchain to to track animals, and had opened offices around Brazil where it is helping farmers restore forests. The company also said this week it was opening a research facility to study lab-grown meat.
But JBS does not make public detailed data about the number of cows, pigs, chicken and other animals it slaughters each year. On the website for JBS USA, the majority owner of Pilgrim’s Pride and other businesses, the company claims to have the “capacity” to “process more than 200,000 cattle, 500,000 hogs, 45 million chickens and 80,000 small stock (lambs, sheep, goats and veal calves) per week,” but does not disclose the actual number of “processed” animals. Its annual output is more than 32 billion pounds of animal products.
I pressed Tomazoni on why JBS does not regularly make public more granular data. Without that information, independent groups say it is virtually impossible to assess JBS’s claims about its emissions.
He replied that JBS withholds that information “not because we don’t want to make calculations about emissions,” but because “we need to protect our own strategic information.”

‘Enhance transparency’
JBS has said that listing shares on the New York Stock Exchange would allow the company to “enhance transparency and strengthen corporate governance.” If it is serious about those ambitions, a good start would be releasing comprehensive, verifiable data about its sourcing, the number of animals it slaughters and its total carbon emissions.
In 2021, JBS made public its Scope 3 emissions (the greenhouse gases that are produced as a result of its activities, but not by assets it owns). Last year, JBS reversed itself and did not disclose Scope 3 data.
When I asked Tomazoni about the reversal, he replied with a revealing moment of candor that spoke volumes about just how transparent JBS plans to be.
“We do not know how to calculate that,” he said.

Biden said he would stop drilling. Then reality hit.
On the campaign trail, Joe Biden pledged “no new drilling, period.” But that promise quickly unraveled as he confronted a hard reality: The president may oversee millions of acres of federal property, but Congress and the courts can have the final say.
Look no further than the tortured history of Lease 261, a 73-million-acre tract of water in the Gulf of Mexico that is slated to be leased to oil companies next month.
The Obama and Trump administrations offered up the tract to the oil industry, but Biden paused the lease along with all other federal oil and gas tracts, deeming climate change an existential threat. Emissions from burning fossil fuels extracted from federal lands and waters account for almost 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
But that wasn’t the end of it. A tangle of lawsuits, court rulings, and Congressional deal making followed. The administration is still fighting in court, but so far has succeeded only in delaying the sale, which is now scheduled for Nov. 7.
“It’s like a zombie lease sale, it won’t die,” said Valerie Cleland, an ocean policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

Much to the outrage of climate activists, the Biden administration is expected to continue leasing areas for new drilling as part of a plan the Interior Department will release on Friday. That’s because the Inflation Reduction Act requires the government to permit oil and gas leasing as a condition for allowing solar and wind farms on federal land and waters, which are a priority of the president. — Lisa Friedman

I watch a lot of films for this column, and it’s the rare one that worms its way into my head the way Brian Duffield’s alien-invasion thriller did. The writer-director pulls off a double challenge: He tells the story almost wordlessly (making you realize just how many movies lazily rely on people speaking to themselves out loud) and creates a dreamlike world in which memories and monsters jostle for power.
The camera almost never leaves Brynn (a fantastic Kaitlyn Dever, of “Dopesick” and “Booksmart”), a young woman living alone in a nice big house. She does not appear to have any family or friends, and aside from the fact that she drives a Subaru, you might think the movie is set in the 1950s or ’60s: Brynn uses a clunky landline, for example, and electronics don’t really figure. Even the extraterrestrials look as if they’d been imagined during that time — they have a prominent forehead and opaque eyes, and arrive in saucer-shaped ships. It is clearly a deliberate choice from Duffield but unfortunately I can’t offer my theory about its meaning without spoiling a key reveal. Suffice it to say that appearances can’t be trusted, starting with the fact that the reserved Brynn turns out to be a tough survivor when she is under attack, and concluding with a resolution simultaneously satisfying and unsettling.
‘The Wandering Earth II’

In Frant Gwo’s “The Wandering Earth” (2019), our planet, propelled by thousands of thrusters, is roaming the universe to escape the sun’s impending explosion and the destruction of the solar system. Oh, and the now-frozen Earth, its remaining population hunkered underground, is linked to a space station guided by a supercomputer named MOSS. How we got to that nutty situation is the subject of this prequel, also directed by Gwo. And there’s a lot to cover because as you might have guessed, turning Earth into a gigantic spaceship is quite the endeavor. (These being productions from China, that country is the force driving the so-called Moving Mountain Project; the movie is no more or less jingoistic than an American equivalent would be.)

“The Wandering Earth II” does not skimp on spectacle and awe-inspiring shots, and Andy Lau (“Infernal Affairs”) makes for a welcome addition as a scientist. Most interesting is the rivalry between competing initiatives to save Earth: physically move the planet out of harm’s way or bank on a digital solution by transferring human consciousness onto digital files. We know which one eventually wins out (or does it?) because this is a prequel, yet the process remains absorbing. And MOSS figures in, too.

Narratives involving messed-up timelines are so frequent in contemporary science-fiction movies that you have to wonder what this popularity says about us: that we live in constant fear of missing out and need as many options and parallel universes as possible? That we are obsessed with the idea of regret and crave second, third or 10th chances? This month’s entry in the thriving subgenre is Andreas Z Simon’s low-budget movie, from Germany, that is both cryptic and playful.
When we meet Merlin (Mario Ganss, an appealing everyman), he is at a computer, editing a scene in which a talking head expounds on the questionable linearity of time and space — elements that, in a way, Merlin can rearrange at a click of his mouse. Out of nowhere, he receives a vinyl LP (and the antique turntable to play it) containing a message that identifies Merlin as a time traveler and gives him instructions: “Kill the clown and rescue the mermaid.” The film has the type of puzzle-box construction that maddens some viewers and energizes others, but there is something compelling about its indie aesthetic — Merlin’s romantic life, in particular, feels lifted from a mumblecore movie.

Watching A-list stars in B movies tends to be great fun. Perhaps because they are free from the pressure of having to earn awards or deliver box-office results — or loosened up by preposterous scripts — they often give unbound, enjoyable performances. Think Adam Driver in “65,” for example, or Ben Affleck in this sci-fi thriller from the excellent craftsman Robert Rodriguez.
Affleck plays Danny, a Texas cop with a heavy past and a present complicated by the murderous machinations of one Dellrayne (William Fichtner), a so-called hypnotic who can mesmerize anybody to do his bidding and creates hallucinatory mindscapes of the kind familiar to viewers of “Inception.” Why Danny appears impervious to Dellrayne’s paranormal power is key to a complicated story involving Alice Braga as a mysteriously helpful psychic and a secret government program called the Division that’s working on a nefarious Project Domino.
The dense plot is a lot to absorb and the execution is often goofy — members of the Division wear red blazers, like Avis employees with even greater powers than dispensing free upgrades. But Rodriguez keeps the action moving, and the denouement might just make you rewatch the movie from a different perspective.

‘The Deal’

This film gains if you look at it as being not as much about a dystopian future as about a dystopian past, more specifically one set behind the Iron Curtain of the mid-20th century. (Uncoincidentally, perhaps, the director, Orsi Nagypal, is Hungarian). Callbacks to communist societies abound, starting with the locale: a drab city of brutalist gray high-rises, protected from the outside world — which has been wrecked by a global pandemic — by a forbidding wall. There, Tala (Sumalee Montano) paints propaganda posters in a classic Socialist-Realist style for the authoritarian government. She has taken “the deal,” which gives privileged access to resources in exchange for the recipient being terminated after 20 years.
This is a good way to control population when necessities are scarce and there seems to be waiting lists for everything, including lifesaving operations. That last issue becomes a critical problem when Tala’s daughter, Analyn (Emma Fischer), needs to get a kidney transplant. The two women embark on a journey in which they discover, among other things, black-market doctors and how the one percent lives. But the plot is almost besides the point: “The Deal” works best as an accretion of quotidian details about life under an oppressive regime."
2023-09-30,"COLLISION OF POWER: Trump, Bezos, and The Washington Post, by Martin Baron
About a year and a half after acquiring The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013, Jeff Bezos told its executives to come up with a slogan for it. “An idea I want to belong to,” was the directive from Bezos, the founder of Amazon. “I’d easily pay $100 to be associated with that idea.”
The newspaper convened committees and hired branding consultants. They landed on “A Free People Demand to Know,” but MacKenzie Scott, Bezos’ wife at the time, nixed it. The slogan he finally approved, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” was unveiled in February 2017, weeks into Donald Trump’s presidency. It was a hit with readers, though it disquieted Martin Baron, the newspaper’s executive editor, who insisted, “We’re not at war with the administration. We’re at work.”
Baron’s “Collision of Power: Trump, Bezos, and The Washington Post,” is less a traditional memoir than a closely observed, gripping chronicle of politics and journalism during a decade of turmoil. (Baron joined The Post in 2013 and retired in 2021.) Against a backdrop of electoral upheaval, the #MeToo movement, a contested Supreme Court nomination, two impeachment trials and an insurrection, his monumental book tells three distinct but overlapping stories.
Image
The first is that of a press corps struggling to make sense of a demagogue unbridled by conventional norms and boundaries, who skillfully positioned the press as his enemy. The book opens with Trump offering his musings to Bezos; Baron; The Post’s publisher, Fred Ryan; and its editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, during a White House dinner at the very moment that the paper broke the news that the Justice Department’s special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was investigating the business dealings of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The Post delegation tried to make clear that there would be no quid pro quo regarding coverage, yet the president called Bezos the next morning to urge The Post to be “more fair to me,” adding, “I don’t know if you get involved in the newsroom, but I’m sure you do to some degree.” Bezos, Baron writes, would “neither be courted nor clobbered into submission.”
In the book’s most candid episode, Baron depicts the newsroom’s monthslong struggle to make sense of the now largely discredited “Steele dossier,” a thinly sourced compilation of rumors about Trump’s Russia ties. Reporters, the saying goes, are only as good as their sources. The Post’s political reporters demanded that their colleagues covering national security chase down the rumors; this group found the request absurd — “We’re supposed to buttonhole national security officials to ask whether Trump is a Russian asset?” Shockingly, no one thought to tell Baron. If there are no secrets in newsrooms, there are certainly information silos.
Ultimately, Buzzfeed News published the unverified dossier, and Baron takes the outlet to task for putting digital traffic over journalistic integrity. “It circulated incendiary and salacious allegations without any evidence that they were true,” he writes. “And it gave Trump a rewarding opportunity to smear the entire press.” But he also faults himself for not pushing The Post harder to explain to readers its own effort — and inability — to corroborate the dossier’s most significant claims.

The second story “Collision of Power” relates is of the encounter of new wealth (Bezos) with old (Bezos bought The Post from the Graham family, who had owned it since 1933). Under the leadership of Katharine Graham, and then her son Donald, The Post came to global prominence for its coverage of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate, but by 2012, the publisher, Katharine Weymouth (Katharine Graham’s granddaughter and Donald’s niece), concluded that the family didn’t have the money, ideas or wherewithal to save the paper from the spiral of decline that has decimated the news industry.
Bezos brought to The Post a flair for consumer marketing, deep knowledge of digital products and services, and an admirable respect for the paper’s editorial independence. Soon after the purchase, the website began to load faster (especially on smartphones, where most readers now get their news). One new digital tool allowed for simultaneous testing of different headlines to see which attracted the most readers. Another, nicknamed the “MartyBot,” automatically reminded reporters of upcoming deadlines.
How news organizations produce articles, charge for subscriptions and market themselves might seem mundane, but such details — Bezos had views on the color of the website’s “subscribe” button — mattered enormously for The Post’s digital turnaround. (The turnaround isn’t complete: Digital subscriptions fell after Trump left office. The Post lost money last year and in January laid off 20 employees. Ryan resigned as publisher in June.) There were no illusions about the relative power of Silicon Valley and Washington, as the fate of storied media brands came to be at the mercy of Google, Facebook, Twitter (now X) and Apple. “We were supplicants in a world where they were sovereign,” Baron writes.
To Baron’s credit, The Post aggressively covered Amazon’s labor practices, its dominant market position and its panoptic collecting of customer data. Owning The Post cost Bezos more than just money (though he has made back his $250 million, and then some). In 2018, his phone was hacked, perhaps, some experts speculated, by the Saudi government, in response to the paper’s critical coverage of the kingdom, including columns by Jamal Khashoggi, who was later assassinated at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
In 2019, The National Enquirer published intimate text messages that Bezos had sent to a lover, Lauren Sanchez, and which the tabloid had bought from her brother as part of what Bezos called a blackmail attempt. (His marriage to MacKenzie Scott ended, and Bezos and Sanchez are now engaged.) Baron tells the story of Bezos’ benevolent stewardship, but doesn’t address whether it’s a long-term problem for billionaires to own newsrooms. Rupert Murdoch, who controlled Fox News and The Wall Street Journal until September, when he announced he was stepping down, gets only a cursory mention.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The third, and most subtle, story in “Collision of Power” is of the humbling of American journalism — what happened to newspapers after their business model collapsed. Before joining The Post, Baron was the top editor at The Miami Herald during the Elián González saga and the 2000 Florida recount, and then at The Boston Globe, which under his watch broke the story of sexual abuse by priests in the Boston Archdiocese. (The investigation was dramatized in the 2015 movie “Spotlight,” in which Baron is played by Liev Schreiber — who also narrates the audiobook of “Collision of Power.”) He had to lead through cutbacks and austerity, reducing the news staff of The Globe (then owned by The New York Times) by 40 percent, as he prioritized local and investigative coverage over foreign and national news.
“Collision of Power” is not a journalism memoir replete with larger-than-life politicians, like Ben Bradlee’s “A Good Life” (1995), or salty anecdotes about newsroom culture, like Arthur Gelb’s “City Room” (2003). If those books captured the heyday of postwar journalism — when profits from advertising made international and investigative coverage possible — Baron’s chronicles an era when disruptions from the internet (and now artificial intelligence) have profoundly shaken journalists’ confidence in the survival of their craft and the stability of their livelihoods.
As the industry has become far more digital and diverse, younger journalists have challenged traditional notions of objectivity. Frustrated by reporters’ combative and emotional tweets, and their broader airing of their social identities, Baron — a staunch traditionalist — considered resigning in June 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic and the racial justice uprising roiled American institutions, including newsrooms. His “despondency” about reporters putting their own voices above those of their publications is compelling, though the move toward personal expression is understandable given that social media incentivizes attention-grabbing and newspapers have become less loyal to their workers.
As Baron describes it, the job of an editor today revolves as much around spreadsheets, team-building, labor negotiations and social media guidelines as it does around relationships with reporters and supervision of coverage. That Baron managed that high-wire act so successfully — The Post won 10 Pulitzers on his watch — in an era of wrenching changes in politics and journalism shows that newsroom leadership, however devoid of ease or glamour, remains essential.

2023-10-01,"Walk past any bookstore or library in America this week, and you are likely to find a sign exhorting you to “Read a banned book.”
Which one, I always find myself wondering? A Roman Catholic missal, which was illegal to print or possess in Elizabethan England? “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” whose recent Italian publisher was sentenced in 2010 to six months in prison and fined $2,000? Ryan Anderson’s critique of the transgender movement, “When Harry Became Sally,” which is among the books prohibited from sale on Amazon, whose dominance of the book trade rivals that of most censorship regimes throughout history?
No, this is not the contraband the bookstores and libraries have in mind.
Americans have found themselves subjected to the vague inducement to read a “banned” book since 1982, when the American Library Association and other groups began promoting Banned Books Week, a cloying festival of liberal self-aggrandizement annually celebrated (if that is the right verb) by publishers and booksellers. This year it runs from Oct. 1 through Oct. 7.
Banned Books Week is, or should be, eminently mockable. Its proponents trade on the moral currency of defiance (“See how brave we are, inviting people to read these daring books!”) but in practice they are doing the opposite — attempting to reify a consensus.

Take a look at the “most banned and challenged” books from 2010 to 2019, according to the American Library Association. Many are war horses of junior-high English, with millions of copies in print: “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Of Mice and Men,” “1984.” Others are best-selling fantasy novels like “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Hunger Games,” which have been made into wildly popular movies and TV shows. The list for 2022 is dominated by politically inflected, sexually explicit coming-of-age stories (“Gender Queer,” “Flamer”), often in comic-book form or otherwise aimed at young adults, many of which have made the New York Times best-seller list.
These are hardly pariah texts. In zero cases since the advent of Banned Books Week has a local or state ordinance been passed in this country that forbids the sale or general possession of any of the books in question. They have not been banned in the sense that, say, many of the works of the historian Frank Dikötter, the author of “Mao’s Great Famine,” are banned in mainland China."
2023-10-02,"Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, testified on Monday that Google’s power in online search was so ubiquitous that even his company found it difficult to compete on the internet, becoming the government’s highest-profile witness in its landmark antitrust trial against the search giant.
In more than three and a half hours of testimony in federal court in Washington, Mr. Nadella was often direct and sometimes combative as he laid out how Microsoft could not overcome Google’s use of multibillion-dollar deals to be the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers.
The internet is really the “Google web,” Mr. Nadella told the packed courtroom, adding that Google could now use its advantage and scale to build tools to dominate the emerging artificial intelligence industry.
The image of the chief executive of a leading tech rival — Microsoft is one of the world’s biggest public companies, valued at $2.4 trillion — saying it could not easily fight Google was striking. Mr. Nadella’s testimony underscored how entrenched Google has become in online search as the government seeks to prove that the company broke monopoly laws by forging anticompetitive deals to crush rivals.

Mr. Nadella’s appearance on the witness stand in the case — U.S. et al v. Google, which is the first monopoly trial of the modern internet era — was also a sign that the bitter rivalry between Microsoft and Google continues unfettered.

Now the companies are locked in an increasingly intense fight over A.I.
“Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I’m trapped in could get even more vicious,” Mr. Nadella said."

2023-10-04,"OUR STRANGERS: Stories, by Lydia Davis
A Lydia Davis story, as we’ve come to know it over the course of five decades and seven collections, is a feat of omission. Often no longer than a page, sometimes laid out like poetry, it captures some quotidian situation with nearly all the context stripped out so that, unbound by any definite place or time, it becomes charismatically strange. “How long the shadow is,/coming across the counter,/from this grain of salt,” Davis writes in “Late Afternoon,” featured in her new collection, “Our Strangers.” The image, diminutive and universal, neatly encapsulates the whole endeavor.
And yet, despite the quality of remoteness that permeates all of Davis’s work, in “Our Strangers,” our present anxieties creep in. The story “Dear Who Gives a C***,” which is formatted as a letter to a company that sells recycled toilet paper, mentions an “attitude of brutal indifference that is all too actually pervasive in the times we are living in.” One story revolves around an off-putting phone call with “a woman who in the end did not seem like a real woman, or even a real human being.” Another, “How He Changed Over Time,” charts the decline of an admirable, learned figure — identifiable as Thomas Jefferson — into a closed-off narcissist. More than one story centers on curdled notions of community, and it’s easy to read them as small indictments of contemporary culture. One gets the surprising sense that even Davis might not be completely immune to doomscrolling.
“Our Strangers” isn’t a polemical book, to be clear, or even one with an identifiable thesis, despite Davis’s request that it be sold only through independent booksellers and Bookshop.org, and not on Amazon. Rather than overt argument, what mainly preoccupies Davis is meticulous, almost obsessive observation of other people: passengers on trains, diners at Salzburg restaurants, a woman at a Watertown Price Chopper attempting to recycle shampoo bottles. The book feels, at times, like a compendium of off-kilter folk tales.
But as the collection builds, a quiet statement begins to form: Davis seems to be providing a vision of how we might relate to the people who exist around us, of what an actual community might look like. The title story catalogs the narrator’s past and present neighbors, and the narrator’s friends’ neighbors, as well as the tenor of each of those relationships — resentful, friendly, tense, indifferent. Neighbors, by virtue of simple proximity, “become a sort of family together,” Davis writes.

There’s a sense throughout of the warmth and delightful randomness of these connections. City passers-by help Orthodox Jews adhere to religious strictures; a mother and a racetrack owner meet to work out the details of a wedding; a man delineates the joys of drinking at airport and hotel bars: “People form bonds at these places — but it’s not personal.” The longest story in the collection, “Pardon the Intrusion,” consists entirely of lines that could have been gleaned from a local Facebook group for free stuff. The result is a hilarious portrait of an imagined neighborhood, with its recurring requests for ukuleles and roosters.
As fun as these neighborly fables are, the stories that linger draw their emotional heft from, or capture wry truths about, our closest attachments. In “Marriage Moment of Annoyance” (there are several stories with this title, all excellent), Davis highlights snippy retorts from one partner to another; multiple stories showcase the disorientation of remembering, yet again, that one’s parents are dead.
A few stories lose their tautness, particularly the ones that mention the process of their own composition. (“Addie and the Chili,” for example, opens with the line “Years ago, Ellie asked me to write the story of our friend Addie and the chili.”) But even these reveal Davis’s ethic, which is as alert to grammatical constructions as to reality’s specifics.
“I know this isn’t too fascinating, but it’s our life,” a mother writes to her children in the affectionate, meandering “Winter Letter.” Through Davis’s eyes, however, nothing could be more consistently interesting.

‘Totally Killer’
Starts streaming: Oct. 6
The offbeat horror-comedy “Totally Killer” is a 1980s-style slasher film with a science-fiction twist. Kiernan Shipka stars as Jamie, a rebellious teenager who has lived her whole life in a small town that was the site of an infamous string of unsolved murders in 1987. When the masked killer — or perhaps a copycat — reappears and slays Jamie’s mother, Pam (Julie Bowen), Jamie travels back in time to 1987 to stop the original spree. While trying to figure out the identity of a knife-wielding maniac, the heroine handles the culture-clash of being a 2020s high school kid stranded in a clique-dominated, politically incorrect era.

‘Lessons in Chemistry’
Starts streaming: Oct. 13
Based on a Bonnie Garmus novel, this mini-series stars Brie Larson as Elizabeth Zott, a talented chemist who struggles to be taken seriously in the sexist 1950s scientific community. When her brazen defiance of her lab’s rules — coupled with an unwillingness to be subservient and girlie — gets her fired, Elizabeth reinvents herself as the host of a science-focused TV cooking show. “Lessons in Chemistry” covers a decade in the heroine’s life, balancing her rise to fame with her early struggles, while also following her brilliant, eccentric colleague and love interest Calvin Evans (Lewis Pullman). A combination of “Mad Men” and “Julia” — with a little bit of “Oppenheimer” mixed in — the series is a portrait of smart, independent people bucking the conformity of their times.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe has lately been all about the multiverse, with movies and TV series offering alternate versions of the classic Marvel characters living in parallel realities. Season 1 of “Loki” got that ball rolling, with a creative and mind-bending story about the roguish Norse deity running afoul of the timeline watchdogs in the Time Variance Authority. For Season 2, Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and Owen Wilson is back as the frequently flustered TVA agent Mobius M. Mobius. Because of the proliferation of new multiverses unleashed in the Season 1 finale, many of the show’s characters find themselves subtly altered and stuck in other worlds, necessitating another trip through time, space and dimensions for these unlikely heroes.

‘Our Flag Means Death’ Season 2
Starts streaming: Oct. 5
The first season of “Our Flag Means Death” arrived without a lot of fanfare. Initially, the show looked to be just a mild-mannered pirate parody, about a ship full of misfit outlaws led by the inept captain Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby). But as the season rolled on — and as Stede’s rivalry and romance with the notorious Blackbeard (Taika Waititi) became more central to the plot — the series’ creator David Jenkins began focusing more on piracy as a haven for people who yearn to live outside the mainstream. Season 1 ended on a cliffhanger, with Stede’s crew stranded on a deserted island and Blackbeard determined to get back to being mean. Fans have been eager ever since to learn how these twists will affect one of TV’s sweetest love stories.
‘The Gilded Age’ Season 2
Starts streaming: Oct. 29
The “Downton Abbey” creator Julian Fellowes brings his uncommon knack for energetic historical melodrama to “The Gilded Age,” a lavishly decorated and irresistibly entertaining look at high society in 1880s New York City. Carrie Coon is superb as a shrewd social climber, married to a nouveau-riche tycoon (Morgan Spector) whose ruthless business tactics irritate the old money types. The rest of the cast includes Louisa Jacobson as a restless young woman living with her eccentric, judgmental aunts (Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon) and Denée Benton as an aspiring writer defying the era’s racist biases. Season 2 will continue Fellowes’s fascination with a pivotal era in American culture, when the upper-crust considered whether an ascendant democracy should still be following Europe’s unwritten rules of etiquette.

‘The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial’
Starts streaming: Oct. 6
The final film from William Friedkin is both an adaptation of Herman Wouk’s provocative 1953 play “The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial” (updated to modern times by Friedkin, who wrote the screenplay) and a summation of the director’s career-long fascination with the line between legal authority and raw power, as seen in his classic films “The French Connection” and “To Live and Die in L.A.” Jason Clarke plays Lieutenant Barney Greenwald, a Navy lawyer defending Lt. Stephen Maryk, who defied orders and relieved his commanding officer Lt. Cmdr. Phillip Queeg (Kiefer Sutherland) of duty during a storm. Though mostly confined to one courtroom set, the movie is a thrilling actors’ showcase; and as with the play, it toys with the audience’s sympathies, raising questions about how justice is properly served in a case involving the rigid military chain of command.
‘Frasier’ Season 1
Starts streaming: Oct. 12
Kelsey Grammer returns to his most famous role, in a sequel series that surrounds the fussy psychiatrist Frasier Crane with a mostly new cast of characters. Crane moves back to Boston from Seattle and gets involved in the lives of his son, Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott), and his nephew, David (Anders Keith). Freddy has turned out a lot like Frasier’s father, Martin — rugged and unpretentious — while David has the same dry wit and nervous energy as Frasier’s brother, Niles. Like the old “Frasier,” this new one traffics in farce, with the comedy driven by misunderstandings and personality clashes.
‘Fellow Travelers’
Starts streaming: Oct. 27
This historical romance tells a story that stretches from the 1950s to the ’80s, tracing a love affair between two political consultants whose lives are affected by the changing times. Matt Bomer plays Hawkins Fuller, a savvy, politically flexible congressional aide who has a fling with Tim Laughlin (Jonathan Bailey), a right-wing speechwriter who admires Joseph McCarthy. Their relationship stretches across decades, through the more permissive ’60s and ’70s and into the conservative revival of the Reagan era. Adapted by the Oscar-nominated “Philadelphia” screenwriter Ron Nyswaner from a Thomas Mallon novel, “Fellow Travelers” is dotted with real-life historical figures and explicitly erotic sex scenes, illustrating how basic human needs can be undone by political expediency.

‘John Carpenter’s Suburban Screams’
Starts streaming: Oct. 13
The influential genre filmmaker and composer John Carpenter lends his name, his music and — for one episode — his directing talents to this hybrid anthology series, which combines true crime and horror. Each episode is anchored by interviews with ordinary people who experienced something extraordinary, encountering real evil in the form of the creeps, the killers and the unexplained phenomena in their seemingly placid neighborhoods. The interviews provide the basic details for these tales; and then the bulk of each “Suburban Screams” episode consists of lengthy re-enactments that have the look and feel of an ’80s slasher movie, as though Carpenter’s “Halloween” were a documentary.

2023-10-06,"In a space race between two businesses started by Jeff Bezos, his e-commerce company, Amazon, beat his rocket company, Blue Origin, to orbit.
Two Amazon prototype satellites were launched on top of an Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on Friday. They are part of Project Kuiper, a communications constellation that is to eventually consist of more than 3,200 satellites. It will compete with SpaceX’s Starlink and other space-based internet services.
Liftoff of the rocket occurred at 2:06 p.m. Eastern time. The rocket’s upper stage then separated from the booster several minutes into flight, carrying the satellites toward orbit.
In a news release, United Launch Alliance, the company that provided the Atlas V rocket to space, said the launch was successful, indicating that the rocket delivered the two satellites to the desired 311-mile-high orbit. On Friday evening, Amazon said in a statement that it had made contact with both satellites in orbit less than an hour after the launch.

After deployment of the solar panels and tests of the spacecraft’s systems, the satellites are to beam internet connections from space to the company’s flat, square antennas for consumers on the ground.
“This is Amazon’s first time putting satellites into space, and we’re going to learn an incredible amount regardless of how the mission unfolds,” Rajeev Badyal, a vice president of technology for Project Kuiper at Amazon, said in a statement from the company before the launch.
Amazon is building satellites and Mr. Bezos’s other company is building rockets, so why isn’t one flying on the other? That is because Blue Origin has yet to launch anything into orbit.
Although its suborbital space tourist rocket New Shepard has made many flights, the New Glenn rocket that it has been developing for more than a decade to take payloads like Kuiper satellites to orbit is at least three years behind schedule. Its debut flight is penciled in for next year.
In April last year, Amazon announced a gigantic purchase of up to 83 launches, the largest commercial purchase of rocket launches ever. That includes 27 from Blue Origin and the rest from two other companies, Arianespace of France and United Launch Alliance of the United States. The contracts with the other companies also rely on new rockets that have not yet flown: the Ariane 6 from Arianespace and the Vulcan from United Launch Alliance.

Amazon also previously announced that it was buying from United Launch Alliance nine launches of the venerable Atlas V rockets. Atlas V has flown for more than two decades but is being retired because it relies on Russian-made rocket engines.
The two satellites, KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2, comprise what Amazon calls the Protoflight mission for Kuiper. They were planned to ride as the payload for the first launch of United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket in May. But during a test of a Vulcan upper stage, a leak of hydrogen ignited in a fireball. In July, Tory Bruno, the chief executive of United Launch Alliance, said that the company was working on a fix and that the first flight of Vulcan was still expected before the end of the year.
In August, Amazon announced that it was switching rockets, from the Vulcan to an Atlas V. That was the second rocket switch for the Protoflight. Amazon originally planned to launch KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat- 2 on smaller rockets from ABL Space Systems, but ABL has also experienced delays.
Officials at Blue Origin, Arianespace and United Launch Alliance have said they expect to meet the schedule of Kuiper launches.
The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates satellite communications to the ground, approved Amazon’s network in 2020. It gave the company a deadline to launch half of its 3,236 satellites by July 2026, with the full constellation to be deployed by July 2029.

A pension fund that owns Amazon stock sued Amazon in August for not buying any launches from SpaceX, which has launched Falcon 9 rockets 70 times this year, and has contracts with other competitors to its Starlink service.
The complaint, filed by the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, said Amazon’s board approved the launch contracts after only cursory reviews and did not take any actions to protect Amazon from conflicts of interest for Mr. Bezos as the owner of Blue Origin and also the chief executive of Amazon at the time.
“For a year and a half, Bezos was free to identify and negotiate with launch providers for Amazon, while also free to negotiate against Amazon on behalf of Blue Origin,” the lawsuit said.
Blue Origin not only will provide New Glenn launches to Amazon but also profits from the Vulcan launches, because United Launch Alliance is buying Blue Origin’s BE-4 engines to power the booster stage of the Vulcan rockets.
An Amazon spokesman said in a statement, “The claims in this lawsuit are completely without merit, and we look forward to showing that through the legal process.”

The lawsuit also recapped years of animosity between Mr. Bezos and Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of SpaceX.
“Given their bitter track record, Bezos had every reason to exclude Musk’s SpaceX from the process entirely,” the lawsuit said. “And Bezos, it must be assumed, could not swallow his pride to seek his bitter rival’s help to launch Amazon’s satellites.”"
2023-10-07,"Married people don’t always wear wedding bands or engagement rings — at least not their original ones.
The longest stretch of time that Mike Wirs wore his tungsten wedding band was in 2019, on his wedding day and during the weeklong honeymoon afterward. Since then, he has been sticking with the silicone rings that he purchased in bulk on Amazon.
“I had already let my wife know that I would not be wearing that most of the time because of occupational hazards,” Mr. Wirs said of the tungsten band.
As a former car mechanic in Deerfield Beach, Fla., he said he had seen colleagues’ skin burned and peeled because of metal rings, and he even took one co-worker to the hospital when his metal-ring-clad thumb was hanging by a ligament. Wearing metal rings is “a big no-no in a hands-on type industry,” he added.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Now Mr. Wirs’s job — estimating the cost of repairing crashed electric vehicles — mostly takes place at a desk, but he still prefers wearing silicone bands while his official wedding band sits in a night stand “collecting dust.”
Mr. Wirs, 35, is not alone in owning duplicate or substitute wedding or engagement rings — some married partners choose to do the same for reasons varying from safety to style. “I don’t always wear my ring when I’m running errands,” said Sarah Kunst, 37, the founder and managing director of a venture capital fund in San Francisco. She often leaves her diamond engagement ring at home in favor of a simple half eternity band or no ring at all, a decision she believes makes sense for “not attracting attention if you’re in an area with higher crime rates.”

Leading up to her Aug. 17 wedding, Dory Zayas, a freelance writer in Manhattan, was worried about losing her diamond engagement ring during her two-week honeymoon in Bali and Hong Kong.
“I was just nervous to be wearing this piece of jewelry that costs so much more than anything else I owned,” she said. Ms. Zayas, 38, received as a gift a second engagement ring made of cubic zirconia and silver, as well as a dupe wedding band, all for less than $100. “In a photo it does the job and just gives me peace of mind while I’m traveling,” she said.

Jewelers are getting in on the dupe game. The Clear Cut, an online jewelry store, offers complimentary 1, 1.5 and 2-carat lab-grown diamonds, which the company calls travel rings, with the purchase of a natural diamond ring of $10,000 or more (though customers pay about $1,500 for the band they’re set on). Benchmark Rings, a men’s brand, offers free “casual rings” with the purchase of certain ring styles, while the Source in the Rochester, N.Y., area offers a “buy one get one free” deal.
The practice has its skeptics. “I think it’s so important to spend your money on things that are going to matter to you in the long run,” said Adrianna Vargo, a certified financial planner at Domain Money in Cleveland.
She believes some customers should skip the expensive ring altogether. “If you’re not going to wear it, then there really isn’t a point to spending a ton of money on it,” she said. “I’d rather see my clients putting that money to use on something that they care more about, whether that’s travel or a down payment on a house.”

But for those who do have expensive rings, there can be hidden expenses for not purchasing a replica. Jill Stier, a contract manager in public health who lives in Manhattan, learned this the hard way: by taking a trip to the emergency room one week postpartum.
Ms. Stier, 34, gave birth to her second child on Aug. 29. “Halfway through my pregnancy, I took my rings off because I noticed my fingers were so swollen,” Ms. Stier said. “I was like, ‘I don’t want to get these stuck on here.’”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Around that time, Ms. Stier considered buying a copy engagement ring, with cubic zirconia, for $100, but decided against it and simply went ringless for the remainder of her pregnancy.
On Sept. 5, the date of her newborn son’s bris, Ms. Stier’s husband suggested she wear her rings. By 10 p.m., the engagement ring was impossible to remove at home. “I was in so much pain,” said Ms. Stier, who walked five blocks to a hospital. “They cut it once, and it wasn’t enough. They had to cut the ring in two different places.”
Ms. Stier said she’s waiting for her finger to “go back to normal” so she can get her ring repaired and resized. In the meantime, the emergency room co-pay cost her $300. “I should have just gotten a duplicate,” she said."

Jump to: Today’s Theme | Tricky Clues
MONDAY PUZZLE — In an article in The Cut last year, Allison P. Davis wrote about a concept which had been recently named by a trend forecaster, known as a “vibe shift.” She characterized a vibe shift as the point at which “a once-dominant social wavelength starts to feel dated” — and pointed out, chillingly, that “not everyone survives” one.
Some of us adapt to the culture. But many of us simply fade into curmudgeonly obsolescence, watching as the vibe moves on without us (me). So in solving today’s crossword, constructed by Zachary David Levy, I was struck by how quickly I recognized the subjects of his themed entries; I wonder how many other solvers will be as quick to catch on.
One might argue that these are forces that have played a central role in shifting our vibes. If not, at the very least, they have changed our ways of doing just about everything else.
Today’s Theme
It may be said that the, ahem, appreciation of four themed entries in today’s puzzle relies on your investment in the clue at 61-Across: “Many a new venture in Silicon Valley … or a hint to 17-, 26-, 37- and 52-Across.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Silicon Valley is practically synonymous with the TECH START-UP. And indeed, what STARTs UP each of today’s theme entries but the name of a TECH company?
The “Kitchen gadget” at 37A, for example, is an APPLE PEELER (and just as useful as any iPhone, harrumph). “Nietzsche’s superior man of the future” (52A) is the ÜBERMENSCH.
My only nitpick is that cracking this puzzle’s revealer made it no easier to distinguish the entry for “Hand bone” (26A) — METACARPAL — from the foot bone I so often confuse it with, the metatarsal. Who named them, anyway? I blame Mark Zuckerberg.
Tricky Clues
1A. Nevermind the fact that “Daddy’s daddy” may inspire wildly different interpretations among different age groups, if last week’s Wordle solution was any indication. Its entry — GRAMPA — is an unusual spelling for the word, having appeared only three other times since 1997.
42A. It’s time we talk about ÉLAN. It means “Pizazz” (see also, from past clues: flair; distinctive flair; panache; zip). Etymology traces the term to a 16th-century French noun meaning “impetus” and from a Latin verb meaning “to throw a lance.”

4D. A decade since being declared the next big thing by The New York Times’s spirits critics, the “Agave-based liquor” known as MEZCAL is still increasing in popularity. (I’m a fan of mezcal margaritas, myself — and if that makes me basic, so be it!)
11D. In baseball parlance, “hits that barely clear the infield” are BLOOPS. Outside baseball parlance, they are the sound of a leaky faucet. Bloop.
49D. Once you’ve managed to say “Aleve alternative” three times fast, you’ll probably need some ANACIN. I’ve only heard this drug referred to in the Crossword, but have since found this commercial from the 1950s that tells me everything I need to know.
54D. Even if you’re not a professional manicurist, you might find yourself using an EMERY board every now and then to keep your nails in shape.

Constructor Notes
Constructors often talk about “seed entries” when discussing themeless puzzles — long, interesting words or phrases that they want to feature in the grid and use as scaffolding to build the rest of the puzzle. When it comes to themed crosswords, I think of these as big-bang entries: an interesting turn of phrase or bit of wordplay that suddenly becomes the impetus for a new puzzle. The moniker can be apt: Sometimes the entire set just hits you all at once. Bang!

Here, my ersatz genesis started with ÜBERMENSCH, which begat AMAZON BASIN, METACARPAL, APPLE fritter, “Tesla coils,” and “Alphabet soup.” (For the record, I make no claim to being a deity in this scenario.) I had to drop those last two entries (everyone still thinks of ALPHABET as Google anyhow, and TESLA COILS was too close to the company itself). Make the fritter a PEELER for symmetry’s sake, and there’s your puzzle. Q.E.D.

The grid features two rather ugly “Utah blocks” — those centered black squares that bear a resemblance to the Beehive State — which is an unfortunate consequence of centering an 11-character entry in a 15 x 15 crossword, and being unable to fill the puzzle otherwise.

Get it with a Times subscription.
We love to optimize our home lives, to tweak our processes at work, to attain peak efficiency in all things and to squeeze all the juice from all of our lemons. I personally admit to choosing T-shirts “first in first out” — that is, pulling them from the bottom of the stacks in the dresser drawer instead of the top so each is worn with precisely the same frequency.
But optimization can go too far. It can be … not optimal. I have just finished reading two books that explore what to do when your optimization needs some dialing back. One is “Optimal Illusions: The False Promise of Optimization” (2023), by Coco Krumme. The other is “When More Is Not Better: Overcoming America’s Obsession with Economic Efficiency” (2020), by Roger Martin.
I also recommend an enjoyable read by my Opinion colleague Parker Richards that came out last week: “Down With Efficiency! (When We Get Around to It.)”
Optimization is a perfect subject for this newsletter because it’s the soul of economics. The marginalist revolution of the late 19th century enshrined efficiency. The intellectual advance was all about making trade-offs in a way that equalized the marginal utility derived from each choice — say, a tad more guns, a tad less butter.
But as both Krumme and Martin write, optimization has blind spots. Optimizing what’s within one’s frame of reference can inadvertently harm whatever is outside of the frame, whether that happens to be nature or social relations or simply peace of mind. For example, the Green Revolution vastly increased crop yields, saving millions or billions of people from starvation. But it squeezed small farmers and reduced biodiversity. Worth it? Of course, but the costs can’t be entirely ignored.
An over-optimized, tightly coupled system is brittle and eventually breaks. Slack is inefficient, so it’s eliminated. But there are times that you need slack in a system — such as excess power-generating capacity to deal with a heat wave. “Place” is lost too, Krumme writes. Optimization means homogenization: “The richness of a small-town community — its generations attending the same schools, diners, churches, local theater performances — thins and dulls.” The third loss is what she calls scale, but it might better be termed smallness. Using agriculture again as her example, she writes, “A small vegetable farm, with greenhouse crops, is more adaptive” than a giant agribusiness."
2023-10-10,"It may be less polished and more rough-hewed than in New York, London or Paris, but Berlin’s theater scene is uniquely diverse, unpredictable and boundary-pushing. Buoyed by lavish public subsidies and boasting a fleet of remarkable actors and daring directors, it is also uncommonly accessible, thanks to low ticket prices and the growing popularity of English surtitles.
This season, Berlin’s five main repertory theaters will present a total of 87 premieres, 29 of them at the Deutsches Theater, a storied playhouse that opened in 1883. Its new artistic director, Iris Laufenberg, opened her tenure by programing the German-language premiere of Suzie Miller’s “Prima Facie,” a recent hit on Broadway and the West End that won Tony and Olivier Awards, including for its star, Jodie Comer.
The Hungarian director Andras Domotor stages the one-woman play as a chamber drama, with minimal props, stark fluorescent lighting and lots of empty space for his star, Mercy Dorcas Otieno. While the staging embraces a degree of abstraction rarely seen in commercial theater in London or New York, the show is also a vehicle for a prodigious and fearless actress.
Otieno, who was born in Kenya, delivers a sweaty and emotionally naked performance as a lawyer who defends men accused of sexual assault, and then finds herself the plaintiff in such a case after she is raped by a colleague. She carries this intense 100-minute-long show on her capable shoulders and commands our attention long after the absorbing drama of the play’s first half gives way to clunky speechifying toward the end of the evening.

A more compelling and disquieting exploration of sexual assault and trauma is “In Memory of Doris Bither,” written and directed by Yana Thönnes and running at the Schaubühne. The play is based on the true story behind the 1982 film “The Entity,” a hit horror flick that starred Barbara Hershey as a woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted by a malevolent spirit occupying her house in Los Angeles. In 1974, Bither, a single mother living with her four children, was at the center of a sensational investigation into paranormal activity that Hollywood later served up for entertainment.
Performed in a mix of German and English (with surtitles in both languages), “In Memory of Doris Bither” does not so much recreate the alleged haunting as examine how the case — and the success of “The Entity” — reverberates. On Katharina Pia Schütz’s sparse set, the interior of a sterile suburban home, a wash of pink wallpaper, carpeting and curtains, the actors Ruth Rosenfeld, Kate Strong and Heinrich Horwitz obsessively sift through memories and try to make sense of Bither’s torment. The play’s horror, it becomes clear, is not supernatural but psychological.
My only complaint about this absorbing and uncanny show is that it ended abruptly after 70 intense minutes. Then again, the play’s unfinished quality, its lack of resolution, may be intentional: Bither, who died in 1999, claimed the haunting was real until the very end.

At the start of this busy theater season, new plays by two leading German-language writers were elevated by young, dynamic directors who crafted fluid and stylish productions for texts that were rather uneven.

The novelist and playwright Rainald Goetz shot to prominence 40 years ago with the novel “Insane,” a nightmarish odyssey through a madhouse. Ever since, he has been a bad boy of the German literary scene, known for a sprawling literary blog and a novel about ’90s techno culture. His latest, “Baracke,” is a poetic, rambling and infuriatingly undramatic play about German history, family violence and the impossibility of finding love.
For the work’s world premiere at the Deutsches Theater, the young Swiss director Claudia Bossard has served up a stylistically varied, epoch-spanning staging that provides a gloss on Goetz’s epic grouse while sometimes subverting it. Nine intrepid actors courageously follow their director into battle, even if the stakes of Goetz’s stream-of-consciousness text aren’t always clear.
Over at the Berliner Ensemble, there was more focused critique in the prolific German-Swiss writer Sybille Berg’s “Things Can Only Get Better” (“Es kann doch nur noch besser werden”) a dystopian parable about A.I. and the Metaverse taking over our lives. It’s somewhere between a screed, a cautionary tale and a blackly comic satire.

The director Max Lindemann floods the stage with digital projections, while actors with illuminated smartphones glued to their hands cavort jerkily on a rotating platform. The characters receive an endless succession of Amazon packages, praise the “great men who have made our lives so easy: Bill, Jeff and, naturally, Elon” and brag about using ChatGPT to write plays. Everything Berg says does seem worrying, but her targets are a bit obvious and the dialogue is often glib.

Like with “Baracke,” the production comes to the rescue, with movement, light, outlandish costumes and eclectic music by the Swiss D.J. Olan! It’s another step in the right direction for the Berliner Ensemble, the playhouse that has recently cast off its conservative reputation and emerged as one of the Germany’s most interesting theaters.
It has become de rigeur to bemoan the loss of Berlin’s gleefully anarchic and experimental side, most clearly represented, perhaps, by the recent transformation of a famous former squat into the slick photography exhibition center Fotografiska. But Berlin can still be relied on to deliver some sheer artistic lunacy.

“Toter Salon” is a monthly series of short performances written and directed by Lydia Haider and performed in an intimate venue at the Volksbühne theater. During the most recent installment, “Blut,” Haider stood in front of a coffin and officiated a gleefully blasphemous mass, which was frequently drowned out by the droning and often earsplitting score, by the Austrian electronic music artist Jung An Tagen.
In her satanic priest garb, Haider also approached the spectators with an ice bucket full of white wine spritzer, which she drizzled into the mouths of willing audience members. For those unwilling to get down on their knees to receive her communion, there were Bloody Marys in plastic shot glasses. Sloppy, underdeveloped and massively weird, the hourlong performance was an endurance test.

Yet suffering though the plumes of cigarette smoke, cheap booze and earsplitting music, I was oddly pleased that Berlin’s theater scene could accommodate both this level of experimental insanity and a well-made play like “Prima Facie.” Berlin may have lost much of its famed wildness, but at least when it comes to theater, there’s something for everyone."

2023-10-12,"Kenneth Dagatan’s “In My Mother’s Skin” is a cursed fairy tale in the same vein as Guillermo del Toro’s 2006 masterpiece, “Pan’s Labyrinth.” Set in the Philippines during World War II, Dagatan’s film follows Tala (Felicity Kyle Napuli), the young daughter of a wealthy Filipino family who is stranded in a mansion with her mother, brother and housekeeper (Angeli Bayani) while her father goes off to fight in the conflict. When her mother (Beauty Gonzalez) comes down with a mysterious ailment, Tala puts blind trust in a captivating forest fairy (Jasmine Curtis-Smith) who promises to cure her. What could possibly go wrong?
Dagatan weaves impressive, bloodcurdling set pieces from a modest budget. Besides the fairy herself, decked out in a gilded costume that Björk might wear onstage, there’s a visual feast of banquets, jungle ruins and hidden treasures that Tala discovers in her explorations. All of this lies in stark contrast to the gory violence that ensues as the fairies gradually lay waste to the family, using Tala’s mother as a host for their flesh-eating tendencies. It’s refreshing to see a horror movie this artful that doesn’t shy away from B-movie spectacle.
In keeping with its historical themes, “In My Mother’s Skin” acts as a cautionary tale about putting one’s fate into the hands of the enemy, and the results are predictably grim. Like this year’s sleeper horror hit “Skinamarink,” this film’s unwavering depiction of children suffering will no doubt come across as excessive to some, but it’s what makes “In My Mother’s Skin” so beguiling and terrifying. True to classic folklore, this is a story that delivers fantasy and queasiness in equal measure.

Bad Bunny, ‘Mr. October’
Bad Bunny surprise-released a new album, “Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana” (“Nobody Knows what’s Going to Happen Tomorrow”). Many of its 22 songs circle back toward the programmed trap beats that helped start Bad Bunny’s career, but now they’re just part of the sonic domain of a world-conquering star. In “Mr. October” he sings and raps about wealth, clothes, fame, sex and celebrity, comparing himself to Michael Jackson and Reggie Jackson and rightfully claiming, “Yo cambié el juego”: “I changed the game.” But the track is far from triumphal; with tolling piano notes, filmy minor chords and skittering electronic tones, the music laces every boast with anxiety.

Ice Spice responds with encouraging, human-sounding specifics: “Think about my future, got you all in it.” But the track ends with Rema’s looped doubts — “Give me promise you ain’t gonna bail on me” — rather than her wholehearted welcome.

2023-10-15,"Rite Aid, one of the largest pharmacy chains in the United States, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, weighed down by billions of dollars in debt, declining sales and more than a thousand federal, state and local lawsuits claiming it filled thousands of illegal prescriptions for painkillers.
The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey. Its largest creditors include the pharmaceutical company McKesson Corporation and the insurer Humana Health. The pharmacy has raised $3.45 billion to fund its operations while it is in bankruptcy, during which it expects to continue to operate its stores and serve its customers.
The company also appointed a new chief executive, Jeffrey Stein, to lead its restructuring. Mr. Stein is the founder of Stein Advisors, a financial advisory firm that focuses on fixing troubled companies. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as Rite Aid’s temporary chief executive since January.
Rite Aid is one of many drugstore chains dealing with lawsuits stemming from the deadly abuse of opioids in the United States. In March, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Rite Aid and its various subsidiaries asserting that the company filled prescriptions for excessive quantities of opioids “that had obvious, and often multiple, red flags indicating misuse.”

The company has denied these claims.
Rite Aid, which has more than 45,000 employees, has struggled in recent years to compete against larger peers like CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as Amazon. Deteriorating sales left the company with less money to invest in its businesses, and more difficulty in paying back its debt. As of June, according to company filings, it had $3.3 billion in debt, not counting the pending opioid litigation.
Rite Aid’s stock has fallen nearly 80 percent since the start of the year.
That array of problems has created “just kind of the perfect storm,” said Sarah Foss, the global head of legal and restructuring at the financial services company Debtwire. “I think Chapter 11 is really the only option for somebody like a Rite Aid to get all of this settled. On a basic level, what bankruptcy does is it allows you to settle it all in one forum.”
Rite Aid has closed several stores in recent months and has been preparing to close hundreds more. The shrinking of the company has made it even harder to compete.
Fentanyl Overdoses: What to Know
Card 1 of 6
Devastating losses. Drug overdose deaths, largely caused by the synthetic opioid drug fentanyl, reached record highs in the United States in 2021. Here’s what you should know to keep your loved ones safe:
Understand fentanyl’s effects. Fentanyl is a potent and fast-acting drug, two qualities that also make it highly addictive. A small quantity goes a long way, so it’s easy to suffer an overdose. With fentanyl, there is only a short window of time to intervene and save a person’s life during an overdose.
Stick to licensed pharmacies. Prescription drugs sold online or by unlicensed dealers marketed as OxyContin, Vicodin and Xanax are often laced with fentanyl. Only take pills that were prescribed by your doctor and came from a licensed pharmacy.
Talk to your loved ones. The best way to prevent fentanyl use is to educate your loved ones, including teens, about it. Explain what fentanyl is and that it can be found in pills bought online or from friends. Aim to establish an ongoing dialogue in short spurts rather than one long, formal conversation.
Learn how to spot an overdose. When someone overdoses from fentanyl, breathing slows and their skin often turns a bluish hue. If you think someone is overdosing, call 911 right away.
Buy naloxone. If you’re concerned that a loved one could be exposed to fentanyl, you may want to buy naloxone. The medicine can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose and is often available at pharmacies without a prescription. Narcan, the nasal spray version of naloxone, has received F.D.A. approval to be sold over the counter and should be widely available by late summer.
“Because they closed so many stores, if you happen to need something, you might not necessarily have a Rite Aid next to you, so you’re going to go to a competitor,” said Chedly Louis, a vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, who follows Rite Aid. “So that’s another reason why you’ve got weakness.”
Mr. Stein, the company’s new head, said his focus would be to steer the company through the bankruptcy process, when it will be able to trim debt, close some stores and deal with the opioid litigation. Mr. Stein said he hoped to help the chain “reach its full potential as a modern neighborhood pharmacy.”

The bankruptcy filing is a dramatic fall for what was once the biggest drugstore chain in the United States. In 1998, Rite Aid’s market value was nearly $13 billion. It closed on Friday with a market value of less $40 million.
“The company has not been well managed for a very long time,” said David Silverman, a retail analyst at Fitch Ratings. “They have been stuck in the perpetual inability to improve their fortune.”
Rite Aid said on Sunday that it was working on a potential deal to sell Elixir, the pharmacy benefit manager it bought for $2 billion in 2015, to MedImpact. Any deal would be subject to approval by a bankruptcy judge.
Pharmacy benefit managers, often referred to as P.B.M.s in the industry, act as intermediaries on behalf of employers and health insurance plans, performing services like negotiating discounts on drugs.

Elixir has been a challenge for Rite Aid, because its smaller scale has put it at a disadvantage when negotiating for larger contracts that could generate more cash. CVS Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRx are the three biggest pharmacy benefit managers, processing about 80 percent of all prescription claims in the United States.

“It would have been different if they would have been able to grow that business, grow that P.B.M.,” Ms. Louis said.
In recent years, Rite Aid has been shuttering stores to keep pace with declining sales. It now has about 2,000 locations in 17 states. CVS Pharmacy, on the other hand, has more than 9,500 stores and Walgreens around 8,700.
Rite Aid shrank its store base significantly after a failed merger with Walgreens in 2017. The Federal Trade Commission had antitrust concerns about combining two of the country’s largest drugstore chains. When the merger fell through, Rite Aid agreed to sell to Walgreens more than 2,000 stores — around 48 percent — along with three distribution centers for $5.18 billion. At the time, Rite Aid said it would be left with its best performing locations, and John Standley, who was the chief executive, said the sale of those assets was an “important strategic transformation” for the company.
Mr. Silverman of Fitch said that Rite Aid “generated quite a bit of cash” from the sale and used it to pay down debt. But, he added, “from a competitor standpoint, now they’re even smaller.”
The Opioid Crisis
Baltimore’s Overdosing Crisis: The city was once hailed for its response to addiction. But as fentanyl flooded the streets and officials shifted priorities, deaths hit unprecedented heights.
Overdose Deaths Dropped: Overdose deaths in the United States declined slightly in 2023, the first decrease in five years. The rare good news in the addiction crisis was attributable mostly to a drop in deaths from synthetic opioids.
McKinsey Under Investigation: The Justice Department is investigating McKinsey & Company, the international consulting giant, for its role in helping drug companies maximize their sale of opioids.
Recriminalizing Drugs: When Oregon decriminalized hard drugs, it wagered that a focus on treatment over punishment would create a new model for drug policy around the country. But after a deluge of overdose deaths and chaos in Portland, Gov. Tina Kotek restored criminal penalties for drug possession.
Rite Aid later tried to merge with the grocery chain Albertsons, but the deal was called off in 2018 after it lost support from Rite Aid’s shareholders.

During the pandemic, Rite Aid initially benefited from a sales boom as people stocked up on hand sanitizers and cleaning and beauty products. It sped up technological offerings, opened smaller-format stores aimed at addressing pharmacy needs and said it was focusing on winning over more millennial and Generation X customers. Rite Aid saw its earnings rise and losses narrow.
But as the pandemic wore on, customers started consolidating their trips to drugstores, cutting into Rite Aid’s opportunities to capture impulse purchases. Social distancing protocols led to a less severe cold and flu season during the first winter of the pandemic, resulting in a big drop in the company’s cough, cold and flu business.
“We just didn’t realize how evaporated that business actually would be,” Heyward Donigan, Rite Aid’s chief executive at the time, said in an interview on CNBC in 2021.
As earnings eroded, the debt load became heavier. “It’s all about the cash flow,” Ms. Louis at Moody’s said.
In June, Rite Aid reported revenue of $5.7 billion for its most recent quarter, down from $6 billion a year earlier, driven partly by continued challenges in selling merchandise like food, beauty items and household goods. Consumers are increasingly turning to Amazon, the corner store and elsewhere to buy those goods.

The company began in 1962 as Thrif D Discount Center in Scranton, Pa. The chain changed its name to Rite Aid in 1968 and became a publicly traded company that year. Its founder and chief executive, Alex Grass, helped expand the company and its stores quickly over the next decade, expanding west to Michigan, Ohio and along the Gulf Coast and West Coast. For a time, Rite Aid was the nation’s largest drugstore chain and the largest within New York City.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Rite Aid was embroiled in a securities and accounting fraud case. Former Rite Aid executives — including Martin Grass, the son of Rite Aid’s founder and a onetime chief executive — were indicted as part of a securities and accounting fraud that regulators said led to a $1.6 billion restatement of earnings, the largest ever at the time. The company was forced to restate its earnings in 2000.
Ms. Burr, the current Rite Aid chief executive, took over after Ms. Donigan abruptly left in January after four years in the role.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers have also filed for bankruptcy amid litigation fights over their role in the opioid crisis. In August, the opioid manufacturer Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals filed for bankruptcy for a second time in three years. Last year, it had promised to pay $1.7 billion, but after making one payment and missing a second one this June, it devised a plan with its creditors to cancel a majority of the $1.25 billion that the company still owed under the original settlement agreement. In exchange, Mallinckrodt paid $250 million ahead of its second bankruptcy."

Diplomatic efforts have picked up pace in recent days to avert an escalation of fighting in the Israel-Hamas war.

Schools and businesses feel more heat on Israel
As diplomats try to keep the fighting in the Israel-Hamas war from escalating, some business leaders are continuing to push back against institutions over where they stand on Israel.
Wealthy donors are seeking to punish universities for allowing what they view as a weak response to antisemitism. And technology executives are threatening to withdraw from Web Summit, a prominent European conference scheduled for next month, over comments by the confab’s C.E.O. suggesting that Israel has committed war crimes.
The Huntsman family said it would stop donating to the University of Pennsylvania. It joins a call by Marc Rowan, the C.E.O. of Apollo Global Management and the chairman of the Wharton School’s board of advisers, to withhold support over what they say has been a reluctance to condemn anti-Israel remarks and antisemitism. Jon Huntsman Jr. wrote to Liz Magill, Penn’s president, that what he called the university’s initial silence on the issue “is a new low.” (Yesterday, Magill more forcefully condemned the Hamas attacks as a “terrorist assault,” language that wasn’t used in the first statement following the incursion.)
Ken Griffin joined calls to hold accountable students whose groups signed pro-Palestinian letters after the attacks. The billionaire financier, who has donated over $300 million to Harvard, said he had pressed a senior university official to denounce those who had signed a letter blaming Israel so soon after the attacks. He added that his Citadel hedge fund would never hire students leaders whose groups signed the letter, calling such a move “unforgivable,” echoing remarks by his rival, Bill Ackman.
And Steven Davidoff Solomon, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a former DealBook columnist, urged more law firms not to hire his students “who advocate hate and practice discrimination.”
Other alumni cautioned against punishing students, echoing comments by the likes of the former Treasury secretary Larry Summers. “You have to consider whether the people signing these petitions are 18 years old and very impressionable and don’t know what they are talking about,” Neal Berger, the president of Eagle’s View Capital Management, told The Times."

An explosion killed hundreds of people today at a hospital in Gaza that was packed with civilians sheltering there, Palestinian officials said. Palestinians and Israelis blamed each other for the blast, and the tragedy could reshape the conflict just as President Biden is expected to arrive in Israel tomorrow.
The Gazan health authorities said that the explosion, which occurred at Ahli Arab Hospital, had been caused by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military said it was caused by a rocket fired by a Palestinian armed group that malfunctioned after launching.
The explosion immediately raised the stakes for Biden’s trip to Israel and Jordan, where he was expected to try to de-escalate the crisis. Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, called off a trip to Jordan, where he had been scheduled to meet with Biden.
The hospital explosion compounded the escalating humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Even before the blast, rescuers were struggling to free more than a thousand people trapped under rubble, and fights were breaking out over loaves of bread.
“The situation in Gaza is a disaster in the truest sense of the word: massacres everywhere,” said Amir Ahmed, a paramedic with the Palestinian Red Crescent, adding that the streets reek of death.
American-led diplomatic efforts to provide safety and aid to Gaza’s two million residents have so far yielded few results. The Rafah border crossing into Egypt is the only potential portal for people to escape and for supplies to enter, but it has remained closed."

Hundreds killed in blast at Palestinian hospital
Hundreds of people were killed by an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City where thousands of civilians had been sheltering last night, local officials said, a devastating loss of life that ignited protests against Israel and the U.S. across the Arab world. The Health Ministry in Gaza said the number of casualties was expected to rise.
Photographs and videos showed bloodied and charred bodies strewn across the courtyard of the Ahli Arab Hospital. Blankets, backpacks and mattresses lay nearby, traces of families who had come to seek refuge at the hospital after their homes had been destroyed.
Palestinian officials said the blast was caused by an Israeli airstrike. Israeli officials said the explosion was the result of a failed rocket attack by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group aligned with Hamas, which a spokesman for the group denied. The Times could not verify either claim.
Context: The deadly explosion came as conditions in Gaza grew ever more desperate. Food, fuel and water supplies are dwindling fast. Israel said yesterday that it had intensified its bombing in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed 2,800 people and wounded 10,000 others, Palestinian officials said, and Israel’s orders to evacuate northern Gaza have displaced at least 600,000, according to the U.N.

Rising anger: Aid and human rights groups have stepped up criticism of Israel’s bombing campaign and evacuation orders which are taking an ever deadlier toll on civilians.
First person: “I can’t describe what I saw. I swear to God — I witnessed the killing of my family, but I couldn’t even handle what I saw today,” Ali Jadallah, a longtime war photographer, said of the hospital blast. “I can’t handle what is happening.”"
2023-10-19,"Sixty five acres on the coast of North Carolina were purchased by Mamie Reels Ellison’s great-grandfather in the aftermath of slavery. That land on Silver Dollar Road became a home, a place to farm and fish, and a sanctuary, stretching from its pine and gum-tree woods to a sandy beach, where the Reels family relaxed for generations.
By the 2000s, though, the Reels homestead was in jeopardy. Developers had claimed the waterfront property, and Mamie’s two brothers, Melvin Davis and Licurtis Reels, lost eight years in jail for refusing to vacate their houses. Directed by Raoul Peck, “Silver Dollar Road” adapts a 2019 ProPublica feature by Lizzie Presser into an intimate portrait of the family’s forbearance in the face of dispossession.
Mamie and her niece Kim Duhon lead the family’s effort to hold onto the land, but while dipping into the legal morass, Peck’s film is more about sitting with the two women and their relatives, hearing out their fears and hopes as their ancestors’ land sits in limbo. Peck, who directed the fierce and engrossing James Baldwin documentary “I Am Not Your Negro,” refrains from systemic-style analysis to let the family speak for themselves about their experience.
A birthday gathering for 95-year-old Gertrude Reels sets the tone early on for the family’s tight-knit circles and sense of continuity. Interviews with Mamie and Kim evoke fond memories of their childhood haven, illustrated with faded photographs; and Melvin, a fisherman with a winning flair, gives us an on-the-ground sense of the land, roaming through woods and waterways. (Peck draws on 90-odd hours of footage originally shot by Mayeta Clark for ProPublica.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Their legal trouble dates back to the 1970s when a Reels patriarch, suspicious of Southern courts, died without leaving a will. His land was passed to his children, but one of the co-owning relatives secretly sold the land to a developer through a legal loophole. It’s only one maneuver among many that have been exploited in a vicious history of Black land dispossession, as the film’s concise captions make clear: Over the course of the 20th century, Black Americans lost about 90 percent of their farmland.
The film’s second half shifts to the battle to free Melvin and Licurtis from a sentence whose substantial length feels racially motivated. But Peck doesn’t give the film over to talking-head experts explaining how the Reels are symptomatic victims. Their weariness and sadness comes through in interviews with them, but they’re also palpably borne up by love and belief. (Animated intertwining branches in the film’s illustrations evoke their family tree.)
While videotaping outsiders on the Reels property during the brothers’ time in jail, Mamie minces zero words about racism among whites. But no one here is defined by this struggle, and amid the looming threats to a cherished home, Peck’s accomplishment is to let the Reels family own their emotional space.

2023-10-20,"The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email.
The first hotel I ever fell in love with was the Metropole, an old-world gem in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi. My wife and I stayed there in 2007 on a break from covering the war in Iraq, and between the plush beds, the deep-ended pool in a quiet courtyard, and the rich history of the place as a hub of activity during the Vietnam War, we were smitten.
When we returned to Hanoi recently, we stayed there again, and quite unexpectedly, we found an Australian story for the ages — a story that confirmed my appreciation for the secrets that hotels hold, and the way Australians make their way through the world.
It has to do with a bunker.
When we checked in, we were asked if we wanted to join a free tour. So, on our last night, we followed a guide named Tom on an hourlong historical extravaganza that traced the hotel’s role. Built by the French in 1901, it served as a stand-in embassy for several countries during the Vietnam War. And because the Metropole held diplomats, combatants and bombs steered clear, making the hotel a relatively safe resting place for dignitaries and celebrities as well.
But in 1965, as the war intensified, the hotel’s managers decided to add an extra layer of protection: a five-room bunker abutting one edge of the pool. Tom told us it was used through at least the end of 1972, when Joan Baez, the American folk singer, arrived with a peace delegation that coincided with a major American attack. She ended up underground.

Her story was well known at the time. In a Rolling Stone interview with Baez afterward, she described the bombed-out city. “It was like a moonscape with all the craters,” she said.

China Lifts Tariffs: In a sign of easing tensions between Australia and China, China said that it would lift the tariffs it placed on Australian wine more than three years ago.
Happy-Go-Lucky No More: After enjoying decades of prosperity, the country’s citizens are suffering from a high cost of living, a choppy labor market and rising inequality.
Gender Discrimination?: An artwork at the Museum of New and Old Art in Hobart, Tasmania, is accessible to “any and all ladies,” according to the institution’s website — and precisely zero men. Does it break discrimination laws?
Looking for Chinese Spies: Australia passed foreign interference laws in 2018 amid rising concerns over covert Chinese government meddling in Western democracies. The first case tried under the laws has raised questions about the breadth of the regulations.
Then the bunker seemed to disappear. As the writer Viet Than Nguyen has noted, “wars are fought twice, the first time on the battlefield, the second time in memory” — and after the American withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, no one seemed to have much use for a warren of tiny rooms under a fancy hotel.
Except for one Aussie larrikin.
“Time for the bunker,” Tom said.
He made us put on helmets as we descended stairs near one end of the pool. The air was cool, the ceilings low. The bomb shelter had been rediscovered roughly a decade ago. Water had to be pumped out, lights restored, and there was not much to see — except on a wall to our right. Tom pointed to graffiti carved into the concrete: BOB DEVEREAUX, 17 AUG 1975.
Devereaux was an administrator for the Australian Embassy from 1975 to 1977 when it was housed in the hotel. The Australians, Tom told us, used the shelter as a wine cellar.
I looked at my wife when we heard this. Of course they did.
When the bunker was reopened, Devereaux read about it and called to apologize for his vandalism. He went back to the bunker a little later: Tom held up an iPad with the photo of an older Australian man with light hair and a printed shirt with scenes from the tropics. He was pointing at the mark he made on the wall.

“I can’t remember doing the graffiti,” he later told a reporter. “They found a couple of empty bottles in the shelter, so it could have been while I was down there, looking for a bottle of wine.”

For six months, the disappearance of $17.2 million in gold bars and cash from a warehouse at Toronto Pearson International Airport has remained a mystery. Now a lawsuit has given the public a glimpse into the victim’s view of the heist.

In April, the Peel Regional Police, who are responsible for the airport, announced that a special container holding the valuable goods was unloaded from an airplane, placed in a warehouse and then disappeared. The police force seemed baffled at the time and offered no other information, such as whom the container belonged to or even the name of the airline that flew it into the country.

While the case remains unsolved, a lawsuit has now filled in several of the blanks surrounding the robbery with still unproven allegations. The lawsuit was brought by Brink’s, the armored car company hired to move the cash and gold bars from Switzerland to Canada, against Air Canada, which flew and stored the high-value cargo container.

According to a statement of claim that Brink’s and two of its subsidiaries filed with the Federal Court of Canada, the cash and the gold were two separate shipments traveling together. The 53 kilograms of cash worth $1.9 million were sent by a Swiss bank to a Vancouver-based currency exchange. The 400 kilos of gold bars worth 13.6 million Swiss francs, or $15.3 million, were going to Toronto-Dominion Bank from a precious metal refinery in Switzerland. (The value of the cargo is slightly higher than the initial police estimate.) Brink’s said that it was responsible to the shippers for covering any losses if the gold and cash went missing.
Brink’s paid a premium, as a flat-rate handling fee and a percentage of the cargo’s value, to send the shipment through a special Air Canada service called AC Secure that, according to the airline, provides greater security and gives the shipment priority for loading and unloading.
Air Canada Flight 881 from Zurich landed in Toronto a few minutes early, at 3:56 p.m. About 24 minutes later the gold and cash were off the plane, and by 5:50 p.m. they were in an Air Canada warehouse for goods awaiting customs inspection.
About 40 minutes later, according to the court filing, an “unidentified individual” entered the warehouse.
“No security protocols or features were in place to monitor, restrict or otherwise regulate the unidentified individual’s access to the facilities,” Brink’s contends.

But the mystery person didn’t pull out a gun or otherwise use force to enter the area where the gold and cash were waiting. Instead, the person’s only weapon was a piece of paper. According to Brink’s, the person showed the Air Canada employees in the warehouse a waybill for “an unrelated shipment.”
Brink’s argues that the Air Canada employees made no attempt to check that waybill’s validity and released the gold and cash to the person, who “absconded with the cargo.”

None of this has been proved in court. Air Canada did not respond to a series of questions I sent. A lawyer for Brink’s referred me to his client, which also did not respond.
The court filing suggests that Air Canada employees or people impersonating Air Canada employees were involved. Without offering any details, Brink’s accuses the airline of “failing to ensure that employee credentials are not susceptible to fraud and/or misuse.” The company also contends that Air Canada did not “verify the trustworthiness and proper training of all personnel and third parties who maintain access to high-value shipments on its behalf.”

The lawsuit is not ultimately about how the robbery was pulled off. Under international agreements on lost and stolen luggage and cargo, Brink’s could expect to recover less than 1 percent of the missing $17.2 million (a situation familiar to anyone who has ever lost baggage on an overseas flight). But Brink’s contends that the extra fees it paid for the secure service mean that Air Canada must now reimburse it for the full amount of the missing cash and gold. The court will have to rule on that argument as well as Brink’s request for damages and legal costs.
I spoke briefly with a spokesman for the Peel Regional Police, who declined to comment on the security company’s description of events. As for the six-month-old investigation, he said that the force had nothing new to add.

2023-10-22,"On a recent episode of Apple TV+’s “The Morning Show,” the television host Alex Levy is conducting a live television interview with a therapist when things take a turn toward the personal.
With millions of home viewers watching, the therapist asks her to complete the sentence “I feel most alive when … ”
“When I’m working,” Alex replies, with zero hesitation.
The therapist responds: “Why only at work?”
Alex, played by Jennifer Aniston, looks stunned. The interview has taken her into uncomfortable territory, and it takes her a moment to gather herself.
The tension between personal needs and professional ambition is a common theme of the current crop of workplace shows, a dependable television genre that has found new popularity at a time when millions of people have changed their relationship with work — whether by switching jobs in the “Great Resignation,” organizing their workplaces or fighting for remote work flexibility.

Alex and her fellow workplace TV protagonists struggle to separate their professional identities from their true selves. They’re wondering if they can excel in their chosen fields without letting their jobs eat them alive.
On Hulu’s “The Other Black Girl,” the assistant editor Nella Rogers learns that there is danger in deciding to “bring your whole self to work” — contrary to the messaging of corporate diversity managers.
On Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso,” the perky soccer coach who gives the show its name has a series of panic attacks that seem to arise from the guilt he feels over having taken a job thousands of miles from where his son and ex-wife are living.
Carmen Berzatto, the genius chef on Hulu’s “The Bear,” finds himself locked in a walk-in refrigerator at the end of the show’s second season, unleashing a stream of curses as he castigates himself for having allowed his personal life to get in the way of his ambitions.
In many ways these characters reflect the feelings of millions of restless workers of recent years. Some 50 million Americans are now doing their jobs from home, at least part time, and many have grown attached to the flexibility. Others have been job-hopping or fighting for higher wages. And so far this year, some 472,300 workers have gone on strike, up from 58,100 two years ago.

When managers began insisting that employees return to the office in the wake of the pandemic, hundreds of workers walked out of Amazon’s headquarters in protest, and dozens of Apple employees signed petitions demanding permanent flexibility.
Across industries and companies, workers have been asking how much of their lives they are willing to give over to their bosses.

In the years leading up to the pandemic, plenty of employers subtly and not so subtly communicated that a workplace could be a substitute for home. Silicon Valley executives offered their employees free meals, lavish happy hours and on-site Zumba. The underlying assumption seemed to be that workers didn’t have to leave the office to find community, which some interpreted to mean that they never should.
Human resources executives encouraged employees to dress as “your authentic self” (per emails to Meta’s recruits), further blurring the boundaries between the private person and the worker who is expected to trade more than 40 hours a week for a paycheck.
But is it wise to “bring your whole self to work” when you may be feeling sad, frazzled or in the mood to loaf? And what if the real you has values that don’t align with the aims of the company you work for?

Those tensions are at the heart of “Severance,” whose employees come to realize the mysterious entity they work for is up to no good, and “The Other Black Girl,” in which Nella suffers professional consequences after confronting the publishing house’s literary star about a racist depiction in his latest book. Hazel-May McCall, the company’s “other Black girl,” had promised to support Nella’s righteous stance, only to step back at the crucial moment.
“You just have to be the person they want you to be,” Hazel-May tells Nella at one point.
Workplace shows have long been a television staple, but the characters who populated earlier programs in the genre seemed to get very little work done. Jim, on “The Office,” sticks Dwight’s stapler in Jell-O; Kenneth, on “30 Rock,” insists that he has to marry an envelope before he licks it.
There is less goofing off in the workplace shows that have been among the most talked about programs since the rise of streaming. The main characters tend to be dead serious about their jobs, nakedly ambitious. Carmy, of “The Bear,” desperately wants that Michelin star; Alex, of “The Morning Show,” would be crushed if her Nielsen numbers were to slip; even the sweet-natured Ted Lasso would be sorely disappointed if the people around him didn’t consider him the very model of the modern-day boss.
A rare old show that focused on coldblooded strivers was the NBC series “L.A. Law.” Given the current appetite for workplace shows that actually show the work, it’s no wonder that it’s making a splashy return to Hulu next month, with all its 172 episodes remastered.
The characters on that series have their 21st century equivalents in the members of the Roy clan and their acolytes on HBO’s “Succession,” probably the buzziest workplace show since “Mad Men.” In almost every episode up to its finale last spring, it presented one hideous variation after another on the theme of how people intent on corporate maneuvering end up cannibalizing their deepest relationships and betraying those closest to them.
At one point, the back-room operator Tom Wambsgans, in the middle of a typically brutal argument with his wife, Shiv Roy, tells her that she would make a bad mother. He doesn’t realize she’s pregnant when he says this. In a milieu where the distinctions between personal and work selves are hazy at best, he seems unable to fathom who she might be when detached from her ruthless corporate persona.

The notion that we might be able to separate the people we are at home from the people we are at work is made literal in the sci-fi series “Severance.” Its main characters have undergone brain surgery to sever their work and personal selves: the nonwork personas are called “outies,” the workplace versions are “innies,” and neither has any idea what the other is up to. When the protagonist’s two selves begin to bleed into each other, he is distraught — and he assumes a leading role in a workers’ revolt.
For Carmy, on “The Bear,” there is little separation between life and work, and he seems to believe that excelling at his job must come at the cost of personal misery. Flashbacks to his family’s household Christmas celebration on Season 2 of “The Bear” show his mother making everyone around her suffer as she prepares a sumptuous feast. It’s clear that she’s a wonderful cook, but the ambience around her meal leaves something to be desired. (After much screaming, fighting, fork-throwing and tears, she crashes a car into the side of the house.) Carmy’s challenge is to push himself to greatness in the kitchen without repelling anyone who might want to get close to him.
It’s a problem he has yet to solve by the season finale, when he is reciting a soliloquy of self-loathing in the locked walk-in refrigerator on the opening night of his restaurant. He blames the fact that he has been too involved with his new girlfriend — too content, too soft, too much in love — to give the workplace the intense level of attention it requires.
When the slightly less tortured Ted Lasso faces his own work-versus-personal-life crisis, he goes in the opposite direction, deciding that he must leave his job in England so that he can be a better father to his son, who is in Kansas.
The “Ted Lasso” team and Apple have been coy about whether the series will return for a fourth season. But if it does come back, and if it continues to follow the ups and downs of its titular character, it might be a tough sell. A show about a contented father who has hit upon the correct approach to work-life balance doesn’t seem like the kind of thing people want to watch these days."

Executives are under pressure to find a response to the Israel-Hamas war that doesn’t offend employees and business partners.

Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times
A new front emerges in the corporate world
As the Israel-Hamas war stretches on — with Israeli airstrikes hitting more targets in Gaza amid calls by the U.S. and others to delay a potential ground invasion — companies are finding themselves increasingly tangled in the conflict’s complex politics.
Businesses across the corporate world are seeking to find a balance in their responses to the war that don’t offend users, partners and their own employees. As universities dealing with irate donors have found, that isn’t easy.
Social media giants are dealing with a debate over online expression. LinkedIn issued a warning to a pro-Israel website that accused thousands of people of publishing pro-terrorism content that was apparently scraped off the social network. Critics of the site said it featured people who didn’t explicitly support Hamas or who sought to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Meanwhile, Meta has struggled with applying its content policies fairly across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company has already apologized for a glitch that translated some language in user profiles from Arabic as “Palestinian terrorists.”
Employers are also facing pressure to take a stand. Corporate leaders have had to weigh how far to go in any statements they make, as they search for a balance between denouncing the Hamas attacks and antisemitism, and decrying Islamophobia and calling for a cease-fire.
Experts say companies often find themselves out of their depth in talking about the knotty topic and that sometimes there’s little benefit to rushing out a statement. Still, leaders of groups have been criticized for not commenting publicly, especially since organizations had spoken out on issues including abortion rights and Black Lives Matter."
2023-10-24,"‘Miss Juneteenth’ (2020)
Stream it on Netflix.
Of all the films that would have been sleeper hits, had they not been released in 2020 when a theatrical push was off the table, it’s hard to top this, the debut feature from the writer and director Channing Godfrey Peoples. Nicole Beharie stars as Turquoise Jones, a Texas single mother whose 15-year-old daughter (Alexis Chikaeze) is about to compete in the local Miss Juneteenth pageant Turquoise won, once upon a time. Peoples’s screenplay sensitively explores poignant questions of opportunities lost and gained, and the mother/daughter dynamics are convincing and compelling. But the real takeaway here is Beharie, whose marvelous, lived-in performance is both inspiring and shattering.
‘Teen Spirit’ (2017)
Stream it on Max.
The actor Max Minghella (whose father Anthony directed the likes of “Truly, Madly, Deeply” and “The Talented Mr. Ripley”) makes an impressive feature directing debut with this story of a girl from the sticks (Elle Fanning) whose golden voice catches the attention of a fallen opera star (Zlatko Buric), who mentors her onto a national singing championship. The story beats are dusty but the approach is fresh, as Minghella focuses on the small details of character and setting that make his telling unique. Fanning does her own singing, and does so convincingly (ditto on her British accent), while investing her 17-year-old character with an appropriately tormented inner life.

‘Nobody Walks’ (2012)
Stream it on Hulu.
The director Ry Russo-Young co-wrote this indie drama with Lena Dunham (who was just launching “Girls” on HBO), and it is an ace fusion of their sensibilities, and their mutual interest in the mind games attractive young men and women can play. Olivia Thirlby is Martine, a New York visual artist visiting Los Angeles — the title is a reference to the comparative absence of pedestrians — to finish an experimental film with the help of a sound engineer, Peter (John Krasinski), whose therapist wife Julie (Rosemarie DeWitt) puts Martine up in their pool house. And that’s when the trouble begins, as Russo-Young and Dunham’s smart script dramatizes how proximity, boredom and hormones can wreak havoc on a seemingly blissful existence.
‘Dredd’ (2012)
Stream it on Netflix.
Thirlby’s other 2012 release could not have been a more startling contrast, a rough-and-tumble adaptation of the ultraviolent British comic book series (previously attempted, to universal pans, by Sylvester Stallone in the mid-1990s). Karl Urban is a square-jawed cop in a futuristic dystopia where police are allowed to not only enforce the law, but carry out its consequences. Thirlby is his partner and Lena Headey is their target, an underworld queen-pin who traps them in a sketchy apartment complex and offers up a healthy reward for their heads. The director Pete Travis executes the nearly nonstop action with bruising intensity, while the better-than-expected script (by the gifted “Ex Machina” and “Annihilation” screenwriter Alex Garland) fills the occasional silences with fastballs of social commentary.

‘High-Rise’ (2016)

Ben Wheatley’s adaptation of the J.G. Ballard novel occasionally feels like it’s lapping itself — Ballard’s 1975 notions of futuristic class warfare and societal breakdown feel almost quaint compared to what we face today. But Wheatley’s film is wildly entertaining anyway, a boisterous, nose-tweaking portrait of well-bred people turning into feral animals at the slightest provocation. Tom Hiddleston is appropriately cynical in the leading role; Luke Evans, Jeremy Irons, Sienna Miller and Elisabeth Moss turn in memorable supporting work.
‘Gloria Bell’ (2019)

With her new film “May December” (and her performance in it) earning rave reviews ahead of its upcoming Netflix debut, here’s another recent Julianne Moore film worth celebrating. She stars as the title character, a middle-aged woman who is still figuring out how to get the most out of her life, and herself, after divorce. An aid to that could come in the form of Arnold (John Turturro), who offers up love — or, at the very least, comfort — but “Gloria Bell” is not about finding yourself through someone else’s eyes. The Chilean writer-director Sebastián Lelio first told this story in his native tongue, in his 2013 movie “Gloria,” but this is no retread; his American take is lighter and funnier, and a resplendent showcase for the charms of Ms. Moore.
‘Bad Axe’ (2022)
Stream it on Hulu.
When the pandemic hit the U.S. in spring of 2020, the filmmaker David Siev was among the many Americans who went home, huddling up with his family in Bad Axe, Mich., to help keep their venerable local restaurant afloat. He brought along his video camera, and captured an indelible real-time snapshot of a country quickly banding together, and then splintering apart with even greater speed and velocity. The resultant documentary works on two levels simultaneously: as a social document of a country in free-fall (with particular focus on how much of the MAGA-infused community turned on the Asian American Sievs), and as an intimate portrait of the family’s own complicated relationships, and how they were tested by forces beyond their control.
‘Back to the Drive-In’ (2023)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
Restaurants, as you may recall, weren’t the only venues to take a big hit during lockdown, and with movie theaters out of commission, drive-in theaters became a safe alternative, and saw a big uptick in their long-struggling attendance. So the documentary filmmaker April Wright, who previously made the 2013 film “Going Attractions: The Definitive Story of the American Drive-In Movie,” went back to the drive-in to see how these (often family-owned) establishments had done during the unexpected boost, and how they were adjusting to life going “back to normal.” Once the topical matters are addressed, it becomes a fascinating character study, as these entrepreneurs — ranging from grizzled veterans to gee-whiz newbies — react quite differently to the regular difficulties of their throwback business."
2023-10-25,"She’s a beloved blonde pop star with the initials T.S. He’s a handsome N.F.L. player with a popular podcast and the initials T.K. Together, they have fused America’s obsession with pop stars and athletes into a celebrity pairing so incandescent it’s almost celestial.
That’s the story of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, the reigning prince and princess of American pop culture. But it’s also the plot of a recent work of erotic fan fiction, which some readers — many of whom are fans of Ms. Swift — are decrying as an invasion of privacy.
In a since-deleted TikTok video, which is still available on her Facebook page, an independent romance author who publishes under the name Ivy Smoak announced the release of a short e-book. In the video, Ms. Smoak claims to have written the novel in three days after receiving requests from readers for a “spicy” romance inspired by Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce’s relationship. According to the trailer, the book would involve a “pop star princess,” a “football superstar,” a “sassy heroine” and a “secret relationship.”
On Sept. 29, less than a week after Ms. Swift’s first appearance at a Kansas City Chiefs game, Ms. Smoak published “Roughing the Princess” to Kindle’s Direct Publishing platform, which made it available for purchase on any Kindle device and as a free download for Kindle Unlimited subscribers.

The cover of the e-book features a cartoon image of a blonde pop star shown from behind. She is holding a microphone and wearing a red football jersey emblazoned with the number 69. While the book claims to be “inspired by” the real-life romance of Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce, and starts out with a disclaimer stating that “any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is purely coincidental,” many readers felt that the attempt at “shipping” — the act of imagining or championing a relationship between celebrities — hewed too close to reality, and they flocked to Twitter, TikTok and GoodReads to denounce it as inappropriate X-rated fan fiction.
In a review on Goodreads, a user with the screen name Isabella called the book, “almost creepy” in a 1-star review. “if i could give this 0 stars, i would,” she said. “i love shipping TS/TK but this makes it weird.”

While the book “Roughing the Princess” was quickly removed from Amazon, the cover could be seen on Barnes & Noble’s website as of Wednesday morning.
To followers of BookTok — the nickname for TikTok’s avid reader community — there is a clear distinction between books that are loosely based on real people, and those that are “real person fiction,” a subgenre of fan fiction in which amateur authors create unauthorized fictional stories involving real people.
Many on BookTok felt that “Roughing the Princess,” which borrows exact details of Mr. Kelce and Ms. Swift’s biography and romance, while using nearly direct quotes from Mr. Kelce’s interviews and podcasts, read more like “real person fiction” than an “inspired by” story. That fact, coupled with the book’s graphic sex scenes, left many readers feeling uncomfortably voyeuristic, as if by simply reading the book they’d participated in violating their favorite pop star’s privacy. Devoted fans of Ms. Swift felt duped and disgusted.

“It’s fine to write a fanfic and it’s fine to write smut, but when you combine the two and then try to pass it off as an ‘inspired story’ when it’s very obviously about two real people, that’s not OK. That’s not right. That’s gross,” said Gina Burgess, 33, a TikTok creator who lives in Florida. Ms. Burgess made a video declaring “Roughing the Princess” to be “the worst book I’ve ever read in my entire life.”
“I read a lot of other books that have smut in them and I’ve never felt gross after them, but this one I did,” Ms. Burgess said.
Other “Roughing the Princess” readers echoed this sentiment in videos posted to TikTok and Twitter.
“This is not what the girlies wanted when we said we wanted a ‘football star meets pop star’ inspired romance book,” Kayla Compton, a social media manager for authors who has more than 54,000 followers on TikTok, said in a review. “It just felt like a gimmick to make some money.”
Ms. Compton, 26, said that as a football fan, a Swiftie and an avid reader, she felt compelled to finish the book, even though she wanted to stop reading after the first few pages. “I felt like I had to review it,” Ms. Compton said. “And I don’t ever do negative reviews, so the fact that I did it speaks to how much she shouldn’t have written it.”
Ms. Compton pointed to the book “The Playlist” by Morgan Elizabeth as a good example of a “spicy romance” that was inspired by Ms. Swift, but isn’t explicitly about her personal life.

Shortly after Ms. Smoak published “Roughing the Princess” online, it was yanked from Amazon, and almost all mentions of it were scrubbed from Ms. Smoak’s social platforms. It’s unclear whether Amazon unpublished the book, or if Ms. Smoak took it down herself; it’s also unclear if it was taken down as a response to reader feedback, or if there were potential legal or copyright reasons for the decision. (Ms. Smoak and representatives for Ms. Swift did not respond to requests for comment.)
Instead of wiping the book’s existence from her social media and continuing to post about unrelated subjects, some BookTok users expressed that they would have preferred for Ms. Smoak to have taken accountability for the release of “Roughing the Princess” and apologize.
“I think she could have come out and said, ‘Hey guys, I messed up,’” said Ms. Burgess. “I’m going to take time to examine what I should be writing and not take real events and make them into smut.”
This isn’t the first time Ms. Swift’s love life has been the topic of fan fiction. Her close friendship with the model Karlie Kloss has long been a source of “celesbian” fan fiction for so-called #Kaylor devotees who believe the two secretly fostered a romantic relationship. But many fans felt that Ms. Smoak’s book crossed a line by including graphic conversations and sex scenes involving two characters so clearly modeled in the image of Ms. Swift and Mr. Kelce, especially when Ms. Swift has been consistently vocal about how much she dislikes speculation about her love life.
“If you’re writing a Kaylor book, that’s not real life, you’re imagining things,” said Ms. Compton. She also pointed out that fan fiction is typically free, whereas copies of “Roughing the Princess” were on sale for $6.99. “Fan fiction either is written about fictional characters or, if it’s about real people, it still has a large element of fiction and it’s free,” Ms. Compton said. “When you write a spicy fanfic story and you’re paywalling it, that’s when it gets weird.”"
2023-10-26,"Amazon reported solid quarterly sales on Thursday, showing that corporations and consumers are spending as inflation has eased.
The company posted $143.1 billion in revenue for the third quarter, up 13 percent from a year earlier. It had $9.9 billion in profits. The results beat analysts’ expectations and surpassed Amazon’s own forecast.
But Amazon also projected a cautious forecast for the holiday quarter, saying sales growth may moderate somewhat in the last three months of the year. The fourth quarter is typically Amazon’s biggest, a period that includes Christmas shopping and an October deals event.
Investors have been keenly focused on the performance of Amazon’s cloud computing business, which is critical to Amazon because it produces a majority of the company’s profits.

For almost a year, the growth of the cloud computing business rapidly decelerated, as enterprise customers cautiously watched their budgets in the uncertain economy. But Thursday’s results showed signs it was stabilizing. Sales in the cloud computing division were up 12 percent, to $23 billion. It had $7 billion in operating profit.
It’s a “delicate” moment, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s finance chief, said on a call with reporters and investors. He said the work business customers have done to reduce their cloud computing costs has slowed some — but not entirely. At the same time, some of them are adding new cloud projects.
Though Amazon is the top provider of cloud computing, it is working to shake off the perception that it is lagging behind rivals, most notably Microsoft and Google, in the wave of generative artificial intelligence sweeping the industry. It has introduced new A.I. products for enterprise customers, and last month it announced plans to invest up to $4 billion in the A.I. start-up Anthropic, which competes with OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed start-up that created the popular chatbot ChatGPT.
A year ago, investors fretted about the state of Amazon’s retail business, whose profits tanked after overexpanding during the pandemic. Andy Jassy, the company’s chief executive, has focused on driving profits by cutting costs and has overseen layoffs, and a drastic pullback in hiring. The company employed 1.5 million people in the most recent quarter, down 3 percent from a year earlier, though still twice as many as before the pandemic.
Consumers are still spending, though are “deal driven” and focusing on lower cost items, Mr. Olsavsky said.

This year, Amazon also rolled out changes to how it fulfilled customer orders, placing more inventory closer to customers in a move that improved delivery speeds and brought down costs.
“The benefits of moving from a single national fulfillment network in the U.S. to eight distinct regions are exceeding our optimistic expectations,” Mr. Jassy said in a statement.
Faster speeds have “increased purchase frequency,” Mr. Olsavsky said, and the lower costs have improved profit margins. Sales for the consumer and retail offerings in North America, its most mature market, increased 11 percent to $87.9 billion, producing $4.3 billion in operating profit.
Several of the most profitable parts of its e-commerce business — notably its advertising offerings — performed well. Growth of Amazon’s advertising revenue accelerated to 26 percent, reaching $12 billion in the quarter.
Sales of services Amazon provides to third-party sellers on its marketplace grew 20 percent, to $34 billion. The costs for sellers to do business on Amazon is a key issue in the long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission last month."

Good morning. You make corn muffins with corn meal, which is dried ground corn. I like those split and griddled in butter. You make tortillas and pupusas with masa harina, which is corn that’s been cooked and steeped in an alkaline solution (a process known as nixtamalization), then dried and ground. A homemade tortilla is a revelation; a pupusa stuffed with cheese and grated yellow squash is paradise.
And you make arepas (above) with masarepa, corn that’s been cooked but not nixtamalized, then dried and ground into a fine flour that leads to a light and fluffy dough. (P.A.N. is a popular brand of masarepa; Goya makes a version as well.) Rick Martínez’s new recipe stuffs the arepas with chicken and avocado for a dish known in Caracas as reina pepiada: curvy queen.

Curvy queen for Saturday dinner, then? (Some Caraqueños add peas to the equation.) Or an asado negro with plain arepas on the side to mop up the sauce? Something Venezuelan, anyway. In the coming months, the country will be much in the news.
Alternatively, you could knock out some Cornell chicken, that taste of upstate New York, with Utica greens on the side.
Whichever route you take, though: banana pancakes for breakfast on Sunday. And, if the shopping goes right and you can find some good ham and a crunchy baguette, jambon beurre for lunch. That’s a sandwich to leave time for afternoon baking: Melissa Clark’s ace recipe for an apple-bourbon Bundt cake, a harvest-season stunner.
For dinner in advance of the cake, how about this mushroom stew? David Tanis’s recipe combines cultivated mushrooms with dried porcinis and a handful of wild mushrooms to deliver an incredible amount of flavor in roughly an hour. Serve over polenta, I think.

2023-10-30,"On a bright September day on the harbor in Copenhagen, several hundred people gathered to welcome the official arrival of Laura Maersk.
Laura was not a visiting European dignitary like many of those in attendance. She was a hulking containership, towering a hundred feet above the crowd, and the most visible evidence to date of an effort by the global shipping industry to mitigate its role in the planet’s warming.
The ship, commissioned by the Danish shipping giant Maersk, was designed with a special engine that can burn two types of fuel — either the black, sticky oil that has powered ships for more than a century, or a greener type made from methanol. By switching to green methanol, this single ship will produce 100 fewer tons of greenhouse gas per day, an amount equivalent to the emissions of 8,000 cars.
The effect of global shipping on the climate is hard to overstate. Cargo shipping is responsible for nearly 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions — producing roughly as much carbon each year as the aviation industry does.

Figuring out how to limit those emissions has been tricky. Some ships are turning to an age-old strategy: harnessing the wind to move them. But ships still need a more constant source of energy that is powerful enough to propel them halfway around the world in a single go.
Unlike cars and trucks, ships can’t plug in frequently enough to be powered by batteries and the electrical grid: They need a clean fuel that is portable.

The Laura Maersk is the first of its kind to set sail with a green methanol engine and represents a significant step in the industry’s efforts to address its contribution to climate change. The vessel is also a vivid illustration of just how far the global shipping sector has to go. While roughly 125 methanol-burning ships are now on order at global shipyards from Maersk and other companies, that is just a tiny portion of the more than 50,000 cargo ships that ply the oceans today, which deliver 90 percent of the world’s traded goods.
The market for green methanol is also in its infancy, and there is no guarantee that the new fuel will be made in sufficient quantities — or at the right price — to power the vast fleet of cargo ships operating worldwide.

Shipping is surprisingly efficient: Transporting a good by container ship halfway around the world produces far less climate-warming gas than trucking it across the United States.
That’s true in part because of the scale of modern cargo vessels. The biggest container ships today are larger than aircraft carriers. Each one is able to carry more than 20,000 metal containers, which would stretch for 75 miles if placed in a row.
That incredible efficiency has lowered the cost of transport and enabled the modern consumer lifestyle, allowing retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Ikea and Home Depot to offer a vast suite of products at a fraction of their historical cost.
Yet that easy consumption has come at the price of a warmer and dirtier planet. In addition to affecting the atmosphere, ships burning fossil fuel also spew out pollutants that reduce the life expectancy of the large percentage of the world’s people who live near ports, said Teresa Bui, policy director for climate at Pacific Environment, an environmental organization.

That pollution was particularly bad during the Covid-19 pandemic, when supply chain bottlenecks caused ships to pile up outside of the Port of Los Angeles, producing pollution equivalent to nearly 100,000 big rigs per day, she said.

“They have been under regulated for decades,” Ms. Bui said of the shipping industry.
Some shipping companies have tried to cut emissions in recent years and comply with new global pollution standards by fueling their vessels with liquefied natural gas. Yet environmental groups, and some shipping executives, say that adopting another fossil fuel that contributes to climate change has been a move in the wrong direction.
Maersk and other shipping companies now see greener fuels such as methanol, ammonia and hydrogen as the most promising path for the industry. Maersk is trying to cut its carbon emissions to zero by 2040, and is pouring billion of dollars into cleaner fuels, along with other investors. But making the switch — even to methanol, the most commercially viable of those fuels today — is no easy feat.
Switching to methanol requires building new ships, or retrofitting old ones, with different engines and fuel storage systems. Global ports must install new infrastructure to fuel the vessels when they dock.
Perhaps most crucially, an entire industry still needs to spring up to produce green methanol, which is in demand from airlines and factory owners as well as from shipping carriers.

Methanol, which is used to make chemicals and plastics as well as fuel, is typically produced using coal, oil or natural gas. Green methanol can be made in far more environmentally friendly ways by using renewable energy and carbon captured from the atmosphere or siphoned from landfills, cow and pig manure, or other bio waste.

But the world today does not yet produce much green methanol. Maersk has committed to using only sustainably produced methanol, but if other shipping companies end up using methanol fuel made with coal or oil, that will be no better for the environment.
Ahmed El-Hoshy, the chief executive of OCI Global, which makes methanol from natural gas and greener sources like landfill gas, said companies today were producing “infinitesimally small volumes” of green methanol using renewable energy.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Companies haven’t done much in our industry yet quite frankly,” he said. “It’s all hype.”
Fuel producers still need to master the technology to build these projects, he said. And in order to finance them they need buyers who are willing to commit to long-term contracts for green fuel, which can be three to five times as expensive as conventional fuel.
Maersk has signed contracts with fuel providers including OCI and European Energy, which is building in Denmark what will be the world’s largest plant producing methanol with renewable electricity. The shipping company already has clients like Amazon and Volvo that are willing to pay more to have their goods transported with green fuels, in order to reduce their own carbon footprints.
But many other companies are not yet willing to pay the necessary cost for greener technologies, Mr. El-Hoshy said.
The missing piece, said Mr. El-Hoshy and others in the shipping and methanol industries, is regulation that would help level the playing field between companies trying to clean up their emissions and those still burning dirtier fuels.
The European Union is ushering in rules that encourage ships to decarbonize, including new subsidies for green fuels and penalties for fossil fuel use. The United States is also spurring new investments in green fuel production and more modern ports through generous domestic spending programs.

But proponents say the key to a green transition in the shipping sector are global rules that are pending through the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations body that regulates global shipping.
The organization has long received heavy criticism for its lagging efforts on climate. This summer, it adopted a more ambitious target: eliminating the global shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emissions “by or around” 2050.
To get there, nations have promised to agree on a legally binding way to regulate emissions by the end of 2025, which they would put into effect in 2027.
Yet countries have yet to agree on what kind of regulation to use. They are debating whether to adopt a new standard for cleaner fuels, new taxes per ton of greenhouse gas emitted or some kind of mix of tools.

Some developing countries, and nations that export low-value goods like farm products, say that strict regulation would raise shipping costs and be economically harmful.
Proponents of the regulation — including Maersk — say it’s necessary to avoid penalizing those who are trying to clean up the business, and provide certainty about the industry’s direction.
“There has to be an economic mechanism by which you level the playing field so that people are incentivized and not punished for using low-carbon fuels,” said John Butler, the chief executive of the World Shipping Council, which represents container carriers including Maersk.
“Then you can invest with some confidence,” he added.

Still, Maersk acknowledges that green methanol is unlikely to be the final solution. Experts say that the fuel’s reliance on finite sources of waste, like corn husks and cow manure, mean there will not be enough to power the entire global shipping fleet.

In an interview, Vincent Clerc, the chief executive of Maersk, said that the entire maritime sector was unlikely to ever be powered predominantly by methanol. But Maersk had no regrets about moving some of its fleet from fossil fuels to methanol now, then adopting new technologies as they become available, he said.
“This marks a real systemic change for this sector,” Mr. Clerc said, gesturing toward the vessel piled high with 20-foot containers in front of him.
Eric Leveridge, the climate campaign manager for Pacific Environment, said his group was glad that Maersk and other shipping companies were moving toward more sustainable fuels. But the organization is still concerned that “it is more for optics and that the impact is potentially being exaggerated,” he said.
“When it comes down to it, even if there is this investment, there’s still a lot of heavy fuel oil ships on the water,” he said."
2023-10-31,"The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. Each month, we’ll choose three nonfiction films — classics, overlooked recent docs and more — that will reward your time.
‘Sans Soleil’ (1983)
Stream it on the Criterion Channel and Kanopy.
The French film essayist Chris Marker (1921-2012) likely left his biggest pop-cultural footprint with “La Jetée,” a half-hour short whose time-travel conceit inspired Terry Gilliam’s “12 Monkeys.” “But “Sans Soleil,” Marker’s unclassifiable 1983 feature, neither fiction nor nonfiction, shows that raw documentary materials can be rendered into something as disorienting and chronologically malleable as fantasy. (Marker credits himself with “conception and editing,” but not direction.) The film belongs on a list of movies that ought to be seen and debated even if you don’t comprehend them. Not that comprehension is the point. “Sans Soleil” is not only unrooted in time but also in place, as a quotation from T.S. Eliot’s poem “Ash-Wednesday” signals at the outset. The title is given in Russian, English and French. The confounding narration in the English-language version consists of the actress Alexandra Stewart reading letters from a nonexistent cinematographer named Sandor Krasna, whose images we appear to be watching.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The film begins with a shot of three children in Iceland. Soon, it travels to Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, among other locales; it is fascinated, most of all, with Japan, particularly its surreal and futuristic aspects, its television screens and its video games. Pac-Man is held up as “the most perfect graphic metaphor of man’s fate.” Familiar Marker totems — pictures of cats and owls — are rendered into electronically tweaked images. A clip dated as February 1980, before the coup in Guinea-Bissau that November, can only be properly understood by moving forward in time, the narration insists.
Stewart describes Krasna’s having taken a trip to the San Francisco area and visiting the locations from “Vertigo,” including the tree cross-section that Kim Novak’s Madeleine touches, saying, “Here I was born, and there I died.” Less considered, the voice-over suggests, citing another film that quotes that scene from “Vertigo,” is the area to the side of the sequoia trunk, beyond what can be touched. What’s there, in the cosmology of “Sans Soleil,” exists outside of time.
‘De Palma’ (2016)
Stream it on Kanopy and Max. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu.
“De Palma” opens with “Vertigo” — more specifically, with Brian De Palma’s recollection of seeing it the year it was released, 1958, at Radio City Music Hall. To him, it’s a film about what a director does: conjuring romantic illusions.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Brian De Palma has always been one of Hitchcock’s most direct imitators, and in the documentary “De Palma,” the filmmakers Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow pay tribute to him with the cinematic equivalent of Hitch’s famous conversations with François Truffaut. They are apprentices learning from a master, and helping remind viewers of what an influential figure De Palma has been. He came up at the same time as his friends Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas. “What we did in our generation will never be duplicated,” De Palma says. “We were able to get into the studio system and use all that stuff in order to make some pretty incredible movies, before the businessmen took over again.”
De Palma always divided critics; detractors variously saw him as derivative or as wasting his ingenious visual style on subpar material. In the documentary, a candid, detailed De Palma, going film by film through his career, could disabuse anyone of the notion that he isn’t brilliant at his job. There are films where he felt everything clicked, like “Dressed to Kill” (1980) and “The Untouchables” (1987). He remembers watching “Carlito’s Way” (1993) and thinking, “I can’t make a better picture than this.” There are other times when things didn’t come off as he thinks they should have. His widely panned adaptation of “The Bonfire of the Vanities” (1990) needed the toughness of “The Magnificent Ambersons” or “Sweet Smell of Success,” he says. It’s a relief, for those of us who find “Raising Cain” (1992) confusing, to hear De Palma talk about how he rearranged it in the editing process. “It has a particular oddness to it,” he says, “’cause it’s not put together the way it was conceived.”
He laments current trends like the previsualization of action sequences, because using computers to plan things out is inevitably going to lead to visual clichés. The special-effects work on “Mission to Mars” didn’t suit him. “You do one of those shots the first day and you’re seeing it every week, as they add one incremental thing to it,” he says. “That goes on for a year, basically,” adding that he was always amazed at filmmakers like Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis who had the patience for that endless repetition.
Is he a Hitchcock imitator? He suggests, in a way, that Hitchcock wasn’t enough of an influence on others, and that the visual storytelling vocabulary Hitchcock developed might die out. “I’ve never found too many people that followed after the Hitchcock school except for me,” De Palma says.
‘Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie’ (2023)
Stream it on Apple TV+.
Another disarmingly candid documentary, “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie” finds the “Back to the Future” actor (who had the main role in De Palma’s “Casualties of War”) reflecting on his career and on his life with Parkinson’s disease, a diagnosis that he revealed to the public in 1998. The director Davis Guggenheim (“An Inconvenient Truth”) takes full advantage of the fact that he’s working with someone who has spent a lot of time on camera. Certainly, Fox seems comfortable as an interview subject in the present day, answering questions with good humor and self-effacement. But Guggenheim also uses film clips of Fox to create a sort of visual archive of his life, so that whatever Fox is speaking about can be accompanied by footage of his younger self. The overall effect makes it feel like Fox had always been making his documentary about his life.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Guggenheim uses the verve of “Back to the Future” (and Alan Silvestri’s score) to help conjure the frenzy that engulfed Fox’s life at the time it was made, when the actor was shuttling between the sets of that film and the sitcom “Family Ties.” “Bright Lights, Big City” (1988), in which Fox’s wife, Tracy Pollan, appeared, helps tell the story of their courtship. And when Fox talks about his early years of acting with Parkinson’s symptoms, and trying to time his medication so that he would peak at just the right moments, Guggenheim includes clips from “For Love or Money” (1993) and “Life With Mikey” (1993), which illustrate one of Fox’s hiding strategies: putting an object in his hand to mask its trembling.
While “Still” shows Fox poking fun at himself, as in a clip from “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” it is a serious movie when it ought to be. It doesn’t shy away from showing the struggles that Fox faces with injuries, for instance. “Gravity is real, even if you’re only falling from my height,” he says with a laugh, after a makeup artist has been shown working to conceal bruising on his face. Yet in spite of that, “Still” finds a way to be an optimistic film. A time machine in its own way — one very different from “Sans Soleil” — it brims with the wit and charisma that made Fox a star in the first place."
2023-11-01,"There’s no such thing as a free iPhone.
But phone carriers would like you to believe otherwise. Over the last few weeks, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile have blitzed their websites, billboards and stores with ads proclaiming that you can “get the iPhone 15 Pro, on us.”
To get this $1,000 iPhone for $0, the carriers say, all you have to do is trade in an older phone and sign up for a wireless plan. In reality, the phone freebie promotions can lure smartphone owners into spending more in the long run by requiring them to subscribe to more exorbitant service plans bundled with superfluous features, such as big high-speed data packages and subscriptions to streaming services.
I spent several days plugging numbers into the carriers’ websites and chatting with store representatives to get some realistic out-the-door numbers. To test the promotions, I submitted a three-year-old iPhone 12 as a hypothetical trade-in. (On average, people upgrade to a new phone every three years.)
Here were the costs of getting the new iPhone 15 Pro through the promotions, excluding taxes:
Verizon’s free iPhone deal would cost about $3,240 over the 36 months required to redeem the promotion, roughly $300 more than buying the new iPhone with a cheaper Verizon plan in the same period.
AT&T’s deal would cost a customer about $2,675 over the 36 months required to redeem the promotion, a little bit more than doing a trade-in for the new phone and selecting a cheaper AT&T plan.
T-Mobile’s promotion would cost $2,400 over two years to redeem the phone credit, about $160 more than buying the new iPhone with a cheaper T-Mobile plan.
“People who think they’re getting free phones from the carrier are in for a surprise,” said Toni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a consulting firm that helps businesses reduce their cellphone bills.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Verizon said that customers could choose which plan was best for them, and that the promotions were intended for people looking for the best network experience. T-Mobile said that deals were not just about free phones and it strove to provide the best value with its premium plans that include perks like Netflix streaming and the flexibility to upgrade frequently. AT&T declined to comment.
If you are looking to save a buck, it is always a good idea to trade in your old phone for credit to shave down the cost of a new one. Just be wary of any promotion offering a freebie.
Let’s dive deeper into the iPhone giveaway promotions advertised by Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. Then I’ll share some better ways to save money with trade-ins.
Verizon
Verizon’s requirements to get a free iPhone 15 Pro are the most aggressive. Trading in an iPhone 12 can earn you $1,000 in the form of bill credits spread out over 36 months. To be eligible, I had to choose a $90-a-month wireless service plan called Unlimited Ultimate. The total cost over the three years would be $3,240.
In contrast, if I traded in the iPhone 12 and picked one of Verizon’s cheaper plans, like the $65-a-month Unlimited Welcome, a basic cellular plan with unlimited data, Verizon would offer $415 for the three-year-old iPhone. The total to buy and use an iPhone 15 Pro on the cheaper plan for three years would be $2,925.
The main benefit of Verizon’s pricier Unlimited Ultimate plan is that it offers 60 gigabytes of mobile hotspotting, which allows you to share a phone’s cellular data connection with a computer. Some people may want this feature, but most will not need it — only 4 percent of mobile users consume more than 50 gigabytes of cellular data a month, according to a report by the technology conglomerate Cisco.
So with Verizon’s free iPhone promotion, you would spend $315 more over three years for a plan with fancy perks than if you traded in your old phone and picked a cheaper Verizon plan.

AT&T
AT&T is offering up to $1,000 off the iPhone 15 Pro with an eligible trade-in. Only the most recent and most expensive smartphones, like last year’s iPhone 14 Pro, are eligible for the full $1,000 in credit. Older phones get less.
AT&T provided a promotional credit of $700 for the three-year-old iPhone 12 in the form of discounts spread out over 36 months of bill payments. That brought the cost of the iPhone 15 Pro to $8.30 a month spread out over three years.
To get the promotion, I also had to choose one of AT&T’s eligible data plans, which start at $65 a month. All told, including one-time fees, the cost of buying an iPhone 15 Pro and using it on AT&T’s network with an eligible plan over three years came out to $2,675.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In contrast, if I traded in the iPhone 12 and picked one of AT&T’s cheaper plans, like the $50 Value Plus plan, AT&T would offer $200 in credit for the older phone, which shaves the price of the iPhone 15 Pro down to $800. Over the course of 36 months on the cheaper plan, the total would be $2,635.
The main difference between the $50 plan and the $65 plan is that the latter offers three gigabytes of mobile hotspotting.
This means you are not getting a free iPhone from AT&T through this promotion. Instead, you would pay roughly $40 extra over three years for a plan with a mobile hot spot feature.
T-Mobile
T-Mobile is offering to make the iPhone 15 Pro free once you trade in your older phone and sign up for its Go5G Next plan, at $100 a month. The free iPhone comes in the form of bill credits spread out over 24 months. Over two years, you pay about $2,400.
But if you sign up for the cheaper Essentials plan at $60 a month, which is not part of the promotion, T-Mobile will offer $200 for the iPhone 12. After you buy the iPhone 15 Pro for $800, the total cost over two years would be $2,240.
T-Mobile’s cheaper Essentials plan includes 50 gigabytes of high-speed data, which is more than enough. The Go5G Next plan includes unlimited high-speed data and subscriptions to Netflix and Apple TV+.
Once again, you are not really getting a free iPhone, but are paying roughly $160 more over two years for extra data and streaming services.
“Consumers may find it challenging to determine whether the more expensive plan offers additional value,” Mr. Toikka said.

Bottom Line
Promotions are temporary, so once the terms expire, the wireless service rates will probably shoot up — and you could end up spending more without noticing.
But don’t let these promotions discourage you. It’s still a great idea to sell your old phone to save some bucks on a new one, and there are a plethora of trade-in programs online.
Sites like Gazelle, Best Buy, Amazon and Swappa offer cash or store credit for your old phone, and their quotes for used phones are usually higher than the phone carriers’. To reduce costs of your phone, shop around for the best offer and pick a wireless plan that suits your budget and needs.
I recently sold my wife’s iPhone 12 through Gazelle for $312 in cash, which she used toward buying an iPhone 15 directly from Apple. That shaved the price of the new phone down to about $500, and she stuck with the cheap family plan that she has used for years with her siblings.
That’s a far cry from free. But it beats burning extra cash on a fancy wireless package she won’t use."
2023-11-02,"At a time when the tech industry’s biggest companies are rebounding from a post-pandemic dip, Apple is suffering through its most prolonged sales slump in more than a decade.
On Thursday, the world’s most valuable tech company said that sales fell 1 percent, to $89.5 billion, from last year for the three months that ended in September, bringing an end to a fiscal year in which it posted sales declines every quarter. The company reported that profits rose 11 percent, to $22.96 billion.
Apple’s most important business, the iPhone, rallied last month behind the release of four new devices, which boosted sales 3 percent, to $43.81 billion, from last year. And the company’s sales for software and services, such as Apple Music and cloud storage, jumped 16 percent, to $22.31 billion.
But sales sank for most of the company’s other businesses, including the Mac, iPad, and the Apple Watch and AirPods. Total product sales dropped by 5 percent, to $67.18 billion.

The results exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for $89.34 billion in sales and $21.77 billion in profit. The company said that it expected sales to be similar in the current quarter to the same period a year ago, disappointing Wall Street, which had projected that sales would increase from a year ago.
Apple’s shares have declined 11 percent from their peak this summer and were down more than 3 percent in after-hour trading on Thursday.
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, faces a bevy of challenges in the year ahead. After a surge in demand for new 5G iPhones, wireless carriers are reporting a slowdown in the number of people buying new smartphones in the United States, Apple’s largest market, according to Arete Research, an investment research firm.
The company said that supply constraints for the iPhone 15 in September blunted sales during the month, but that supplies were improving and would be able to fulfill demand in the current quarter.
In China, Apple is confronting renewed competition in the luxury smartphone business from Huawei. The Chinese smartphone maker had been hampered in recent years by U.S. restrictions on its access to 5G technology and Android software, but in August it revealed a jade-green smartphone, Mate 60 Pro, that has the same capabilities as many iPhones. Its release was followed by the Chinese government directing employees of some government agencies to stop using iPhones for work.

Sales of Apple’s new flagship iPhones declined 4.5 percent during the final weeks of September from last year, according to Counterpoint Research, which analyzes the smartphone market. The dip was an outgrowth of the broader downturn in consumer spending in China, the firm said.
Last month, China expanded its challenge to Apple’s business by launching a regulatory review of the company’s biggest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn of Taiwan. The manufacturer is facing a tax audit and being investigated over its compliance with land use regulations. The scrutiny comes as Terry Gou, Foxconn’s founder, runs for Taiwan’s presidency in a campaign that could boost the ruling party, which opposes closer ties with Beijing.
Mr. Cook traveled to China last month in an unannounced visit that included stops at an Apple store, a visit to the factory of Luxshare Precision, a Chinese iPhone manufacturer, and a meeting with Wang Wentao, the country’s commerce minister.
“I could not be more excited about the interactions I had with customers and employees,” Mr. Cook said during a call with analysts on Thursday. He said that the company’s business in China remained strong, adding that the iPhone business set a record in mainland China during the three months that ended in September.
The broader tech industry has been lifted by enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence. Last month, Microsoft reported that investments in A.I. were beginning to help sales of its cloud-computing business. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which has invested heavily in A.I., disappointed investors, who had hoped for a greater lift to sales. Amazon and Meta Platforms, Facebook’s parent company, also emphasized their investments in that area.

But Apple, which is known for its secrecy, has been quiet about its plans for generative A.I. On Thursday, Mr. Cook said that the company was investing in generative A.I. but was unlikely to provide details until it had a product to bring to market. “We’re going to do it responsibly, and you’re going to see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart,” Mr. Cook said.
As it looks ahead to next year, much of the company’s focus will shift to the release of its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. The $3,500 device, the Vision Pro, has the potential to provide a new revenue stream at a time when sales of its other products have slowed. Analysts project Apple will sell fewer than half a million units.
The company also is focused on reviving sales of its iPads and Macs. On Monday, Apple revealed new MacBook Pros and iMacs with speedier processors and encouraged customers with older Macs to upgrade. Sales of Macs declined 27 percent, to $29.36 billion, over the past fiscal year."

Noah Kahan’s song “Stick Season” currently sits at No. 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. On its own, that’s a moderately impressive feat. But it’s more remarkable because “Stick Season” is the title track of an album released just over a year ago. Via diligent touring and an instinctual grip on how to leverage TikTok, Kahan has squeezed a fan favorite so hard it became a hit.
That success arrives a few years into Kahan’s career, which began with more straight-ahead pop and shifted into rootsier territory during the pandemic. He inflects his songs with bits of Vermont attitude and lore, and has collaborated with Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves.
On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about how Kahan’s niche stardom has given way to pop acclaim, how Vermont figures into his songwriting and sound, and how he revisits the rustic mainstream rock of the early 2010s.

2023-11-04,"The negotiating committee of the actors’ union, SAG-AFTRA, told its members on Saturday that it had received a “Last, Best and Final Offer” from the major entertainment studios as a strike that has brought much of Hollywood to a standstill continued for a 114th day.
“We are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals,” the negotiating committee said. They did not say when they would respond to the offer, which came after an hourlong video conference call that included top studio executives.
Included in the offer was a wage increase that could be the highest in four decades, according to a person familiar with the offer who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. The studios also offered the actors a new way to determine residuals for streaming programs based on performance metrics, and protections on artificial intelligence, including consent and compensation requirements. The studios also offered an increase to the pension and health funds.
The virtual meeting on Saturday featured the largest group of top entertainment executives yet to engage with the negotiating committee, underscoring the urgency with which the studios want to return to work in an effort to salvage the fall television season and ensure next summer’s theatrical box office will not be disrupted.

Four executives have spearheaded the talks: NBCUniversal’s Studio Group chairwoman and chief content officer, Donna Langley; the Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos; the Disney chief executive Robert A. Iger; and Warner Bros. Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav. They were joined by the Paramount Pictures chief executive Brian Robbins; the co-chairs of entertainment for Disney, Dana Walden and Alan Bergman; Mike Hopkins and Jennifer Salke from Amazon Studios; the Sony Pictures chairman Tony Vinciquerra; and Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg of Apple Studios.
The entertainment business has been at a standstill for months because of strikes by writers, who walked out in May, and actors, who joined them in July. The writers’ strike was resolved a little over a month ago, but the actors’ work stoppage has continued to grind on, leaving thousands out of work for close to six months."

When Joe Biden ran for president four years ago, he ran as the electability candidate — a broadly appealing, moderate Democrat from Scranton, Pa., who could defeat Donald Trump.
There aren’t many signs of his old electoral strength in a new set of New York Times/Siena College polls of the six states likely to decide the presidency. Trump leads Biden in five of the six states — Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Michigan — which would likely be enough to give him the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Biden leads in the sixth state, Wisconsin.
Trump leads by at least four percentage points in each of the other five states:

New York Times/Siena College polls
The striking results seem to be more a reflection of Biden’s weakness than Trump’s strength. Trump is just as unpopular as he was when he lost the election three years ago, if not slightly more so.
Instead, the change is the public’s view of Biden. During his time in office, attitudes toward him have turned decidedly negative. In the last election, voters judged him to be more likable than Trump, to have a better temperament and to have a more appealing personality. Those advantages have largely disappeared.
Instead, voters say they are concerned about Biden’s handling of the economy and about his age. More than 70 percent of registered voters in the battlegrounds agree with the statement that Biden is “just too old to be an effective president,” up from around 30 percent in the run-up to the last election.

2023-11-06,"When Rebecca Yarros pitched her publisher a sexy fantasy about telepathic dragons and their riders, she thought it might be a tough sell.
She’d built a career and a dedicated following writing romances, often drawing on her experience as a military wife. What she was proposing was wildly off-brand: an epic fantasy series with dragons, griffins, magic and political intrigue.
To Yarros’s surprise, her publisher, Entangled, loved the idea, and wanted to launch a new fantasy imprint with it. Over a feverish few months, Yarros crash-wrote “Fourth Wing,” an intricately plotted 500-plus-page narrative that takes place at an elite war college, where two dragon riders feud, then fall in love. She was stunned when she learned they were printing more than 100,000 copies and rolling out an elaborate marketing campaign with limited-edition hardcovers.
Yarros — who lives in Colorado Springs and has a busy home life, with six children, two dogs, a cat, two chinchillas and a bearded dragon — was exhilarated, but also felt as if she was “in a vise.”

“The pressure was utterly intense,” she said. “I was like, am I going to be personally responsible for dragging down this whole publisher?”
Her publisher assured her it would be a hit. Still, Yarros was unprepared for the frenzy that has erupted over “Fourth Wing” and its sequel, “Iron Flame,” which comes out on Nov. 7.
Since its release in May, “Fourth Wing” has sold more than two million copies globally, according to the publisher. It has been on The New York Times’s hardcover fiction best-seller list for more than six months — with three months at No. 1. It took off in Britain, Australia and South Africa, selling more than 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, and translation rights have sold in around 30 languages.
On TikTok, hashtags for the author and the series have been viewed more than a billion times. Amazon MGM Studios has optioned the series for a TV adaptation, with Yarros as an executive producer.

“It was a slow, steady build, and then it went absolutely mental,” said Rebekah West, Yarros’s editor at Piatkus Fiction in Britain.

The novel’s runaway success stems in part from the boom in romantasy, a hybrid of romance and fantasy that is drawing fans from both genres. “Fourth Wing” is a steamy mix that blends fantasy elements (elaborate world building, an epic battle between good and evil, fire-breathing winged dragons) with popular romance tropes (the enemies-to-lovers plot, plus explosive sex scenes, including one that starts a literal fire).
“It’s just been massive,” said Shannon DeVito, director of books at Barnes & Noble, about the response from readers.
For Yarros, the escalating fame has been jarring.
“I’m not comfortable in the spotlight,” she said recently over dinner in Manhattan, the night before an appearance at New York Comic Con. “I would rather stay home with my kids.”
Navigating best-sellerdom is made even more complicated for Yarros by chronic illness; she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a genetic connective tissue disorder. It can be difficult for her to stand or talk for more than an hour, which makes marathon signing sessions and fan events a challenge.

“Sometimes I feel like part of my job is to make sure she survives this with her health intact,” said Louise Fury, Yarros’s literary agent.
In “Fourth Wing,” Yarros wrote about her condition for the first time, giving her protagonist, Violet Sorrengail, many of the afflictions she suffers from, like dizziness, brittle bones and joints that easily dislocate. Violet’s mother, the commanding general, pushes her to join the elite dragon rider forces like her older siblings, but Violet struggles at the war college. Her condition, which is never named, leaves Violet so weak that she can’t stay on her dragon, nearly plummeting to her death before she grudgingly accepts a saddle that locks her into place. Other dragon riders belittle her as small and fragile, but Violet’s ruthless antagonist and love interest, Xaden, is won over by her determination.
“I read fantasy growing up and I never saw that, I saw these powerful heroines,” she said. “I wanted to tell a story about a girl who should not succeed, and who should not be able to endure an overly brutal environment.”
Yarros grew up as the youngest of four in a military family — her grandfather was a general, and both her mother and father are retired lieutenant colonels. Her family bounced around Washington, D.C., Oklahoma, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Germany and Colorado.
She took up writing poetry and fiction early, and wrote a novel for a high school English project. When she was a college student at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, she met her husband, Jason Yarros, a young private in the Army, at a karaoke bar one night. They got married and quickly had a child, and Yarros dropped out of college.

Jason, who flew Apache helicopters, was deployed five times, with four tours to combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. While he was gone, Yarros worked on her college degree in history. When she graduated, at age 29, they had five children.
In 2003, after Jason was injured by an antitank land mine in Iraq, Yarros developed insomnia. To occupy herself in the middle of the night, she read romance novels. Several years later, when Jason was on his third deployment, Yarros decided that instead of just reading novels, she would write one.

She knew so little about the publishing world that in 2011, when she wrote her first book, an urban fantasy, she bought “Publishing for Dummies” to figure out her next steps. She signed with an agent, but no publishers made an offer. Undeterred, she decided to write about a young woman in a military family. The result was her debut, “Full Measures,” a romance about a woman whose father is killed in Afghanistan. She sold it to Entangled, and it was published in 2014.
It was the start of a prolific career. From then on, Yarros worked at a breakneck pace, releasing two novels a year. But she often felt discouraged by her stagnant sales.

In the years after she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos in 2020, she thought about quitting. A flare-up had left her so dizzy she could barely walk from her dining room to her couch without collapsing. Her four sons were also diagnosed with the disorder. The stress of writing, managing her illness and caring for her family felt overwhelming.
“I got to a point where I was like, is this worth it?” she said.
Then, in 2022, her pitch for “Fourth Wing” was accepted. She’d written 20 romances, but this was a chance to write fantasy, something she’d wanted to do ever since her first book failed to sell — and to write an otherworldly epic about a heroine with a chronic illness.
“Writing Violet is super cathartic, because she struggles to accept the accommodations that are given to her, and I have that same struggle,” Yarros said.
She wrote “Fourth Wing” on an accelerated schedule, working 12 to 14 hours on some days. Her husband, who had retired from the military after 22 years, looked after the household. When the book hit the New York Times best-seller list, they both cried. “He would kill me for saying that,” she said.
Soon after she was done with “Fourth Wing,” she wrote “Iron Flame,” the second installment of a planned five-book series.

Now, “Iron Flame” is shaping up to be another mega best seller. Barnes & Noble is holding midnight release parties at more than 200 stores, including one at the Union Square store in New York that Yarros plans to attend along with 600 fans; tickets to that event sold out in minutes. Independent stores, as well as bookstores in Britain and Australia, are also throwing midnight parties, a rare occurrence that booksellers say reminds them of the fan fervor around “Twilight” and “Harry Potter.”

At Comic Con last month, a crowd of ecstatic fans gathered at the Javits Center to meet Yarros.
One reader told Yarros she had skipped work to come. Another said his wife had sent him to get her copy of the book signed — and told him not to bother coming back if he failed. Some wore T-shirts and backpacks that said “Basgiath War College.” A few came as Violet, in leather bodysuits with daggers strapped to their thighs.
Several people thanked Yarros for creating a heroine with a chronic illness.
Ashley Sitarski, a “Fourth Wing” fan from New Jersey who was diagnosed with lupus last year, said it was refreshing to read about a character who lives, and thrives, with a chronic condition. “The fact that she wrote her illness into the book is huge,” she said.
Another reader, Evey Alvarez, who has had dire health complications from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, immediately recognized Violet’s illness, and was gratified to read about a character with her condition who is also “sassy,” she said. “The representation matters.”

The signing was taxing for Yarros, who felt a migraine coming. But she was beaming throughout, introducing herself to each reader, as if she still couldn’t quite believe that they had all come just to see her.

2023-11-07,"How political should fashion get? At least when it comes to acceptance speeches. That was the elephant — or woolly mammoth, or orca — in the room Monday night at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards, a.k.a. the Oscars of fashion.
“We carefully thought about the appropriateness of a fashion celebration at a time like this,” Thom Browne said as he presided over his first ceremony as chairman of the C.F.D.A. Especially one that doubled down on the glitz and glamour. The event, held in the American Museum of Natural History in the cavernous room just beneath the belly of the great blue whale, was hosted by Anne Hathaway in a Ralph Lauren denim gown and many carats of diamonds.
And, as Ms. Hathaway said, it was chockablock with the mononymically famous: Gwyneth (Paltrow, in a black turtleneck and black satin skirt), receiving the Amazon Innovation award for Goop; Kim (Kardashian, in halter-neck Chrome Hearts), a presenter; and Tom (Ford, in a velvet tux), there as a former C.F.D.A. chairman and to hand a statuette to his ex-business partner Domenico De Sole.
Clockwise from top left: Mary J. Blige, who introduced the hip-hop tribute in Christian Siriano; Gwyneth Paltrow, in Goop's G. Label; Laura Linney in Maria Cornejo; and Tom Ford, who presented the founder's award to Domenico De Sole, with Anne Hathaway in Ralph Lauren.

The Hollywood red carpet’s loss, thanks to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, may have been the C.F.D.A.’s gain, given that the presenter list also included Demi Moore, Ayo Edebiri, Laura Linney, Mary J. Blige and Naomi Watts.
But, Mr. Browne said, despite all the glitter, the evening was about “coming together as a collective to champion creativity, diversity and inclusion within our American industry.”
It was a reminder, he continued, that fashion was a way to make “the world see through new perspectives.” That it could be a way to unite people rather than drive them apart. And not just the people in the room, though there was a lot of air-kissing and oohing about outfits going on over the chicken potpies.
Maybe that’s why, though there were some repeat winners — Catherine Holstein of Khaite, who received the women’s wear designer of the year award for the second year in a row; Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of the Row, who won accessory designers of the year, their sixth C.F.D.A. award, and weren't even in attendance — the evening largely avoided the sense of déjà vu or “let them eat cake” that it has been associated with in the past, when the same names seemed to surface in an uninspiring way year after year.

Instead, Mr. Browne’s opening words set the tone for the evening, which alongside the major awards also celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop and the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Versailles, when American designers faced off against the French.

Willy Chavarria, the winner of the men’s wear designer of the year award, wearing an enormous white rosette on his lapel and clutching his statuette, underscored the point. “I know that we’re all sitting in the shadow of some really awful things that are happening in the world, and there are some things we can do and some things we cannot,” he said. “And I think we all need to stand with those people that are being hurt — in any way. And we need to do whatever we can through our business, through our human context or our daily lives, to make others feel loved and empowered.”
Alina Cho, the first Asian American to receive the Eugenia Sheppard media award, noted that as one of few little girls in her elementary school class who looked different, she discovered in fashion a way to belong. Similarly, Serena Williams, the first athlete to receive the fashion icon award, swathed in a giant satin Thom Browne boa speckled with crystals, said: “I knew when I was a little girl that I was different. So I saw fashion and style as a way to, you know, kind of distinguish myself.” (Ms. Williams was seated next to the Vogue editor Anna Wintour, whom she called “my mentor, champion and loving friend.”)
And Rachel Scott, the founder of Diotima and winner of the emerging designer of the year award, whose work incorporates artful, three-dimensional crochets, observed that her win represented the fact she had been seen. “For me to be seen means that the people of Jamaica and the Caribbean are also being seen,” she said.

Still, the most emotional moment of the evening came from Maria Cornejo, receiving the lifetime achievement award after 25 years in the business. “It’s so hard to celebrate right now,” she said, noting her past as a political refugee who fled as a child from Chile to England with her family. She said she was crazy enough to start a career as a “Latin independent designer” when her son, who was also her date for the evening, was 8 months old and her daughter was 6. Though it had been very hard to stay independent, she said, they showed her “why it was important to care.”
“I dedicate this award to peace and the innocent children that are voiceless right now,” Ms. Cornejo said, her voice breaking. In the end, that idea may have been the biggest winner of the night, rather than any single designer."

2023-11-09,"Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil fell to a five-year low, the country’s National Institute of Space Research announced on Thursday, a sign that Brazil, which has the biggest share of tropical forest in the world, was making progress on its pledge to halt all deforestation by the end of the decade.
The institute reported that 3,500 square miles had been clear-cut between August 2022 and July 2023, a 22.3 percent decrease from the same period a year earlier. The decline in tree loss is estimated to have reduced the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent. Brazil is the world’s sixth largest emitter, by some measures.
“Behind this was a political decision,” Marina Silva, Brazil’s environment minister, said on Thursday at a news conference. “We are changing the image of the country when we change this reality.”
The announcement was an encouraging sign that local policies could change the trajectory of global forest loss. The world lost 10.2 million acres of primary forest in 2022, a 10 percent increase from the year before, according to an annual survey by the World Resources Institute. Brazil accounted for more than 40 percent of the destruction recorded.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The results were announced almost a year after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January. He said in his October 2022 victory speech that Brazil was “ready to resume its leading role in the fight against the climate crisis.”
Two-thirds of the deforestation happened before Mr. Lula came into office, the government said. Under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation rates climbed to a 15-year high as Mr. Bolsonaro’s administration loosened environmental protection policies.
Environmental fines in the Amazon more than doubled under Mr. Lula, the government reported, as his administration sought to rebuild the forest’s protection policies. Almost all of the deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest is illegal, mostly the result of land grabbing and farmers’ replacing trees with pasture.
Brazil isn’t the only country making progress in the region. Colombia, which has a tenth of the Amazon rainforest, announced on Tuesday that deforestation rates there had fallen by 70 percent in the first nine months of the year.
But El Niño, the climate pattern that has helped cause a historic drought fueling major wildfires in the region, may jeopardize some of the progress in the region, the environment ministers of both countries acknowledged.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Wildfires have consumed more than 18,000 square miles of the Brazilian Amazon in the first nine months of the year, an area twice the size of Vermont.
More than a third of fires raging in the Brazilian Amazon are destroying old-growth forests, Ms. Silva said. “It’s a demonstration that the climate change is already impacting the forest,” she added."

Leaving the door open to more rate rises?

Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times
A multi-headed strike to the markets
The S&P 500 was on its way to a ninth straight day of gains on Thursday when investors got hit by a double whammy: a lackluster auction for 30-year Treasury bonds and more hawkish words from Jay Powell, the Fed chair, that prompted a sell-off in stocks and bonds.
The snapped winning streak — which would have been the index’s longest since 2004 — was a reminder that inflation and global growth concerns remain high, especially given the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Stock futures this morning are pointing to another weak open.
Powell hasn’t dismissed the possibility of raising rates. The subdued jobs report released last week led many on Wall Street to predict that the Fed would stop increasing borrowing costs. Not so fast, the central bank’s chief suggested at an event hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
He called out the “head fakes” posed by fluctuating inflation data, and reiterated that the door remained open for further interest rate increases. (Speaking of doors: Powell appeared to lose his cool when climate change protesters disrupted his speech, issuing a profanity as they were escorted off the stage.)
“If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,” Powell said, adding that the central bank’s goal to push inflation down to its 2 percent target “is not assured.”
Another shock came from a dud of an auction for 30-year Treasury notes. The scheduled event wrapped up shortly before Powell spoke, with fairly tepid investor uptake. The weak demand sent yields spiking for long-duration government bonds; bond yields rise when prices fall.

LOVE HAS WON: THE CULT OF MOTHER GOD 9 p.m. on HBO. On April 28, 2021, police searched a house in Moffat, Colo., where they had gotten reports of a dead body. The remains they found belonged to Amy Carlson, a livestreamer and leader of a group called “Love Has Won.” Carlson and her followers believed that she was a reincarnation of Jesus, Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, among others, and referred to her as Mother God. The coroner reported that her cause of death was a combination of alcohol abuse, anorexia and chronic colloidal silver ingestion, which she sold as supplements. This three-part documentary series interviews former cult members, including her partner, who calls himself Father God.
BLACKBERRY 10 p.m. on AMC. This film, which originally had a limited release in Canadian and U.S. theaters, is coming to small screens after the filmmaker Matt Johnson reworked it into a three-episode limited series with 16 minutes of previously unseen footage added. “BlackBerry” is scripted and fictional, but shot like a docu-series, looking behind the scenes of the company that created the BlackBerry pagers, personal digital assistants and cellphones. It stars Jay Baruchel, Glenn Howerton and Johnson.

NCIS: SYDNEY 8 p.m. on CBS. This spinoff in the extremely popular “NCIS” universe was originally meant to air only in Australia — but after other American-based NCIS franchise series had their release dates delayed to 2024 because of strikes by the Hollywood writers and actors unions, the network decided to air the Australian show here as well. It centers on a joint task force of U.S. NCIS agents and the Australian Federal Police working to uncover naval crimes.
JAY-Z AND GAYLE KING: BROOKLYN’S OWN 9 p.m. on CBS. Jay-Z, the famously private rapper, sat down with the interviewer Gayle King for three hours in conjunction with the opening of “Book of HOV,” billed as a tribute exhibition, at the main branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. The exhibition follows him from his Brooklyn childhood to stardom and devotes attention to each of his releases as well as to his philanthropic work and to artifacts from his life.

It seems like this year while some of us are still buying festive fall decorations and pinning recipes for creative Thanksgiving sides, TV has decided to skip right to Christmas. If you’re ready to indulge, this winter favorite is already on the schedule. Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo, at the helm of the Griswold family Christmas planning, see their arrangements go awry when a long lost country cousin shows up with his family that needs a place to live.

THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939) 8:45 p.m. on TBS. “We’re off to see the wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz!” In this essential movie, the magic begins when a tornado picks up Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog, Toto, from Kansas and drops them in Oz. There, she meets all sorts of colorful and often frightening characters and teams up with the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), who wishes for a brain, the Tin Man (Jack Haley), who longs for a heart and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who desperately needs courage, for a perilous journey up the yellow brick road to Emerald City in the hope of asking the wizard to grant all their wishes.

ANNIKA 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This show about the Glasgow Marine Homicide Unit, starring Nicola Walker in the title role, is wrapping up its second season this week. In the six new episodes, the team investigates more complicated murders that metaphorically — and literally — wash up on the shores of Scotland."
2023-11-14,"As Americans gather this Thanksgiving, tens of millions will sink into their couches for one of the country’s enduring rituals: watching football games showcasing the Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys while turkeys are being dressed, carved and gobbled.
The National Football League has long been a broadcast juggernaut, with its games accounting for 83 of the nation’s 100 most-viewed telecasts last year, according to the ratings firm Nielsen.
But as the reach of traditional television wanes, and major live events like the Academy Awards and the World Series face historically low ratings, the N.F.L. is embarking on an ambitious strategy to try to maintain its dominance. The league is getting into the production business in a big way, working with partners to bring new programming to streaming services in an effort to extend its reach in a fractured media environment and remain relevant for younger viewers.
The N.F.L. already has more than 50 productions in the pipeline.
“Quarterback,” an eight-episode documentary that followed Patrick Mahomes and others during his second M.V.P. season, was the most-watched series on Netflix for more than a week in July. Upcoming projects include this month’s “Bye Bye Barry,” an Amazon Prime Video release about Barry Sanders, the Houdini-esque Lions running back, and a coveted documentary on Jerry Jones, the unfiltered Cowboys owner.

“I know that the N.F.L. has been very protective of its shield,” said Jesse Sisgold, the president and chief operating officer of Skydance Media, the production company that has partnered with NFL Films on a slate of new projects. “But I think they realize they really want to attract an even broader audience in terms of people who are not locked in to football every Sunday.”

The joint venture began last November and has resulted in documentaries on Prime Video and Roku. The league is also interested in working with other services like Apple and Hulu, said Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.’s chief media and business officer.
“If there is a saturation point out there, we haven’t seen it,” Rolapp said.
NFL Films, the league’s entertainment arm, built its legacy on triumphant scores and soaring narration by John Facenda — known as the voice of God — that played over highlights of the league’s best teams in the 1960s and ’70s. More recently, it has produced the HBO show “Hard Knocks,” which annually follows a team through training camp, and five N.F.L. seasons of the Prime Video docuseries “All or Nothing.”
The N.F.L. is hoping to capture an even larger audience interested in the off-field lives of players through its partnership with Skydance, which had a hand in movies including “Air,” “Top Gun: Maverick” and entries in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise.

“I think the thirst for our fans is stronger than it’s ever been,” said Ross Ketover, the senior executive at NFL Films. “And we want to exponentially grow this in the next five to 10 years, not just in the documentary space, but in the entertainment space, from scripted to animated to any other area where people are consuming content.”
Live sports have been a linchpin for network television, with the N.F.L. commanding billion-dollar deals for the rights to broadcast its games. But sports organizations are also looking for ways to reach new audiences, hoping to imitate how the Olympics are presented as a mix of intense live competition and humanizing back stories.
As streaming distributors clamored for more sports documentaries, which are relatively cheap to produce, NFL Films was convinced to diversify its portfolio. The robust online conversations over documentaries about other sports were also hard to ignore.
Five seasons of “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” which began airing on Netflix in 2019, turned many Americans into motorsports enthusiasts. And “The Last Dance,” the 10-episode documentary about the 1997-98 Chicago Bulls that aired on ESPN and Netflix, kept fans of the National Basketball Association engaged in 2020 while games were canceled during the coronavirus pandemic.
This year, Skydance and NFL Films have partnered on “The Pick Is In,” a Roku documentary following four teams during the N.F.L. draft in April, and “Kelce,” a Prime Video feature released in September that retraced the 2022 season of Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce.

“We love the idea of having original content to pair with our live broadcast,” said Matt Newman, the head of original content for Amazon Sports, which now airs “Thursday Night Football” and will stream the league’s first Black Friday game this month.

The N.F.L.’s push into other forms of storytelling is bold, said Ronnie Kay, a professor at New York University who will teach a course on sports documentaries next spring and previously worked at the N.B.A.’s entertainment arm.
“A lot of entities are doing it behind the scenes or pushing this little thing and that little thing, but they’re doing it the right way, announcing it and going full power,” she said.
Not everyone agrees. Jim Irsay, the Indianapolis Colts owner, said he was “disheartened” when the N.F.L. decided to invest into Skydance’s budding sports division because he felt the league could achieve its ambitions independently and avoid splitting the profit with an outside agency.
The league built a new West Coast headquarters in 2021 that houses NFL Network, its television and digital platform, and other aspects of its media hub. NFL Films manages shows or other video elements for nearly each network that carries the league’s games, plus YouTube and international broadcast partners.
“I was against it, but other people are asleep at the wheel, in my opinion, and let it go,” Irsay said of the Skydance deal.

Skydance has sold nine unscripted projects and taken four scripted projects to market, said Sisgold, the studio’s president.
The biggest prize so far is the documentary on Jones, one of the most powerful and vocal figures in professional sports. The Cowboys, who won three Super Bowls in the 1990s, are a consistent prime-time draw and drive the national conversation regardless of their performance.
“People have been going after the ’90s Cowboys doc as sort of the holy grail for years,” Sisgold said.
ESPN and Amazon, which both air N.F.L. prime-time games, bid on the Jones documentary but lost out to Netflix, which spent about $50 million on the project, according to a person with direct knowledge of the sale. The person spoke under anonymity because Netflix, which declined to comment on the deal, has not formally announced the acquisition. (Puck reported on the sale in July.)
Jones had said he would participate in a documentary once the league found a new studio partner, according to Rolapp, the N.F.L. executive. Jones led a committee of seven owners that identified and selected Skydance.

As it leans into documentaries, the N.F.L. faces new challenges.
Viewers who root for players to crash into one another on the field may not necessarily be interested in watching Kelce tend to livestock, or in seeing Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins take out the trash at home. And multiple sports documentaries this year were criticized for not properly addressing difficult topics, including Netflix’s looks at Johnny Manziel, the former party-loving quarterback at Texas A&M, and the University of Florida football teams coached by Urban Meyer.
“If the goal is public relations for the N.F.L. and a lack of a critical voice that we sometimes see, I think that can run the risk of some backlash,” said Andrew Billings, a professor of communication at the University of Alabama.
The N.F.L.’s first documentary for Netflix, “Quarterback,” was a partnership between NFL Films and Omaha Productions, the media company founded by the Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning. The series followed Mahomes, Cousins and Marcus Mariota, then with the Atlanta Falcons, through all of last season, but it has been a struggle to cast a follow-up.
Quarterbacks tend to be reclusive during the season, and several high-profile ones, including the Eagles’ Jalen Hurts, the Miami Dolphins’ Tua Tagovailoa and the Baltimore Ravens’ Lamar Jackson, have said they declined to participate in “Quarterback” when approached by Netflix.
A representative for Omaha Productions said Manning was unavailable for comment. The N.F.L. and Netflix declined to say whether “Quarterback” would return for a second season.
“It’s a commitment for these guys, and they have to commit to time when they’re already focused on the season,” Rolapp said, “but there’s a lot of players in our league.”

Upbeat investors see Tuesday’s inflation data as a possible turning point in the Fed’s battle against soaring prices.

Good news for global markets
Yesterday’s impressive rally in U.S. stocks and bonds has gone worldwide this morning, as investors see central banks making gains in their fight against inflation. Adding to the good news was a breakthrough in the House last night that could avert a government shutdown.
S&P 500 futures signal further gains at the opening bell. The question now is whether this represents a false dawn on inflation, or the start of a durable decline in rising costs — and interest rates.
Here’s what’s exciting investors: Yesterday’s cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index data has shifted discussion in the markets from potential interest rate hikes to cuts, and what that might mean for stocks. President Biden, whose poll ratings have been hurt by inflation, also cheered the numbers.
Other promising data points came out this morning. Inflation in Britain fell to its lowest level in two years. And consumer spending and industrial output in China rebounded last month, a hopeful sign for the world’s No. 2 economy.

Market optimists have moved up their bets on rate cuts. Futures markets this morning pointed to the Fed starting to lower borrowing costs by May, sooner than previous estimates of closer to the end of 2024.
Less aggressive is Mohit Kumar, the chief financial economist at Jefferies, who wrote today that big rate cuts would begin after the presidential election next year. Jefferies predicts the Fed’s prime lending rate going to 3 percent by the end of 2025 from its current level of 5.25 to 5.5 percent.
Others are more cautious. Pessimists note that the “core” inflation data in yesterday’s C.P.I. reading, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, was just a tenth of a percentage point below estimates. “I’m afraid that inflation may not go away that quickly,” Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase told Bloomberg Television.
Washington gave markets another reason to cheer. The House’s passage of a stopgap spending bill appears to remove the risk of a shutdown, which has been seen as a potential drag on the U.S. economy.
But even here, political tensions in Congress — including some threats of physical violence — provide reason to be cautious. (Remember that last week Moody’s lowered its U.S. credit outlook to negative, citing “continued political polarization” in Congress hampering legislation.) The House funding bill required Democratic support to pass, and Politico reports that hard-right Republicans may hold the House hostage with a flurry of procedural votes.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The U.S. and China strike a climate agreement. The countries pledged to ramp up their use of wind, solar and other renewable energy sources in hopes of displacing fossil fuels, ahead of a meeting between President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, in San Francisco today. Among the American C.E.O.s set to meet with Xi are Elon Musk of Tesla, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil.
The F.D.I.C.’s chair faces tough questioning over the agency’s culture. Senators asked Martin Gruenberg yesterday about how the regulator handles accusations of harassment and discrimination after The Wall Street Journal reported on toxic work conditions there. (“What the hell is going on at the F.D.I.C.?” asked Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.) Gruenberg said he was “personally disturbed” by the report and was conducting an internal review.
The Times takes a close look at David Zaslav. The Times Magazine published an in-depth profile of the Warner Bros. Discovery C.E.O., while another article looks at his tumultuous oversight of CNN. One question raised by the pieces: Will the debt-laden Warner Bros. Discovery soon be up for sale? “It’s there for the taking,” Barry Diller, the media mogul, told The Times. “Whether that will happen depends on whether someone wants to take it. Saudi Arabia? Don’t laugh.”
Rory McIlroy resigns from the PGA Tour’s board. The pro golfer stepped down five months after the tour announced an agreement with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the backer of LIV Golf, to try to create a joint company that would end the sport’s money-fueled battle for supremacy. McIlroy has been among LIV’s most outspoken critics of that effort. Meanwhile, the PGA Tour said it would give players equity in that combined company if it’s formed.

Banking’s A.I. leaders and laggards
As the promises of artificial intelligence and its transformation potential grow, banks are among the businesses racing to incorporate the technology into almost everything they do.
But in its latest ranking of how the industry is adopting A.I., the data start-up Evident found a growing gap between the leaders and everyone else. Its founders shared the new report first with DealBook.

The methodology: Evident rates institutions on four main areas — talent, innovation, leadership and transparency — using publicly available data like news releases, research papers and job data. The company nearly doubled the number of banks it rates to 50, by expanding eligibility to institutions with $200 billion in total assets and including lenders in the Asia-Pacific region.

Early adopters have extended their leads. While all banks have committed to A.I. — “I don’t think there’s a single bank in the index that hasn’t doubled down on A.I.,” said Alexandra Mousavizadeh, Evident’s C.E.O. — some are clearly ahead. JPMorgan, which led the last survey, was again on top, ranking first or second in each of the four main criteria.
But Capital One, a smaller U.S. rival and a new entrant to the list, came on strong. It ranked first in talent, with the highest proportion of A.I. developers and engineers to overall head count of any institution. And it has hired Prem Natarajan, a former executive at Amazon’s Alexa business, as its chief scientist and head of enterprise A.I.

Other notable developments:
Banks have increasingly focused on generative A.I. — spurred by the rise of tools like ChatGPT — for help in customer service, fraud detection and more.
Banks are taking different steps to show their A.I. credentials. JPMorgan and the Royal Bank of Canada are leaders in research, while Capital One and Bank of America (15th) are among the most prolific in seeking patents.
Europe has some strong performers, including UBS, which retained much of Credit Suisse’s A.I. talent when it bought its Swiss rival. But many of the region’s lenders still prioritize specific solutions over comprehensive plans, according to Annabel Ayles, Evident’s co-C.E.O.
Canadian lenders continue to punch above their weight, ranking strongly across the talent, leadership and transparency and ethics criteria. “Some of the highest quality patents come from Canada,” Ayles said.

Haley’s rising fortunes may draw more big backers
Things are looking up for Nikki Haley in the Republican presidential primary (relatively speaking, given Donald Trump’s dominance). Her poll numbers have risen in recent weeks on the back of strong performances in the G.O.P. debates, as rivals like Tim Scott drop out of the race.
Now reports suggest that Haley may be gaining ground in another important area: backing from deep-pocketed corporate donors.

Ken Griffin of Citadel is close to deciding whether to back her. “We’re at the finish line on that choice,” the billionaire financier told Bloomberg Television yesterday. Griffin, who has said he wouldn’t back Trump, is one of the most prolific Republican donors, having given around $72.7 million in the 2022 election cycle alone.
His support could provide Haley with crucial financial ballast as she battles Ron DeSantis to become the leading anyone-but-Trump candidate.
And Haley has reportedly impressed Jamie Dimon, according to Axios. An unnamed source told the publication that the JPMorgan Chase C.E.O. — who has given to both Democrats and Republicans in recent election cycles — liked her positions on the economy and the role of business in governing.
Haley already has support from notable wealthy donors, including the oil magnate Harold Hamm, Jim Haskel of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and the deal maker Aryeh Bourkoff.
How Microsoft’s 1990s case could apply to Google
A two-month Google antitrust trial is nearing its conclusion in Washington while the search giant faces a separate legal challenge in a San Francisco courtroom, where it’s accused of wielding monopolistic power over the running of its app store.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
One of the government’s last major wins against Big Tech came against Microsoft in the 1990s. That fight has loomed large in the Google trial, writes Steve Lohr for The Times: The Justice Department and a group of states say Google is running something similar to the Microsoft monopoly playbook in dominating the search market. Google rejects that analogy.
Those cases have these things in common:
Digital platform economics: The Microsoft case highlighted the power of the “network effect,” in which a digital product becomes more valuable the more people use it. In the Google case, the government argues that the huge search usage gives Google more data to train and improve its search algorithms.
That, in turn, attracts more users and advertisers. Google has argued that its in-house innovation and investment account for its market lead.

Contracts with competitors: With Microsoft, deals with personal computer makers and internet service providers were a big focus. Some of those partners felt that they had to strike a deal with Microsoft to get access to its Windows desktop software, prime virtual real estate in the early days of the web.
Google’s case involves big payments — known as pay-for-default contracts — to Apple, Samsung, Mozilla and others to make Google the featured search engine on their devices and browsers.
A potential outcome: If the government and states prevail in the Google case, a potential remedy could involve the banning of pay-for-default deals. That, too, would mirror the outcome in the Microsoft case, where the company was prohibited from making exclusive deals that thwarted competition.

‘Invincible’
When to watch: Now, on Amazon.
Season 2 of this comic-book adaptation is now underway, with new episodes arriving Fridays, but start with Season 1: The show has an elaborate mythology and is also a fraught family drama. The story centers on Mark (voiced by Steven Yeun), who in Season 1 learns that his father, Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons), is not the hero he thought. Everything on “Invincible” is cranked up to its top operatic intensity — the brutal and constant beat-downs as well as the Freudian despair and teenage brooding. Luckily the casting and vocal performances are top-notch, too, so the whole show feels — in a bracing, invigorating, engrossing way — like it’s in all caps."
2023-11-17,"Since Thursday afternoon, those in the sports media industry, particularly women, have been talking about one thing: that the prominent broadcaster Charissa Thompson had casually volunteered in an interview that she had made up reports while working as a sideline reporter.
Young women just beginning careers in sports journalism asked one another in group chats if the kind of practice Ms. Thompson was describing was OK. Veteran journalists who have held prominent sideline reporting roles said they carefully crafted statements to post on social media, their impulse to defend their profession overriding their reluctance to criticize another woman.
Andrea Kremer, an Emmy-winning sports journalist who has both reported from the sidelines of N.F.L. games and called them from the broadcast booth, described the damage from Thompson’s comments as “profound.” In particular, she said, it harmed those working as sideline reporters, who are relied on to provide news on things like injury updates during the game and to elicit instant reaction from coaches and players.
It is a role that centers on establishing trust with both the teams and leagues being covered and with the viewing audience. It is dismissed by some viewers, who say the questions asked of players and coaches are often banal, leading to generic answers. And for female sideline reporters, that disrespect can often be coupled with the sexist trope that the most important thing they can do on air is look good.

“The sideline role has always been questioned about its necessity, which I think I’ve explained to you is erroneous,” Ms. Kremer said in an interview on Friday morning on a landline while her cellphone pinged repeatedly in the background.
“But,” she added, “I don’t remember anybody ever wondering, ‘Did they make that up?’ Now, there is that kernel of doubt.”
Ms. Thompson was a sideline reporter for Fox for the 2008 through 2010 seasons, and now is the host of a Fox N.FL. pregame show and Amazon Prime’s “Thursday Night Football.” During a segment on Barstool Sports’s “Pardon My Take” podcast this week, Ms. Thompson said that during games in which a coach either wouldn’t talk to her at halftime or came out of the locker room too late, she would “make up the report sometimes.” She said she felt it was fine, since no coach would object to her citing boilerplate comments about the team’s performance.
On Friday morning, Ms. Thompson disavowed what she said on the podcast. “I have never lied about anything or been unethical during my time as a sports broadcaster,” she wrote on Instagram. Ms. Thompson said that when a coach did not provide information in a halftime interview, she would report her own observations and not attribute them to anyone.
Representatives for Fox and Amazon declined to comment, and would not make Ms. Thompson available for an interview.

It is not the first time Ms. Thompson has made this particular claim. In an exchange last year on the podcast she hosts with the Fox sideline reporter Erin Andrews, Ms. Thompson detailed a specific instance when, she said, she made up a report during a 2008 Detroit Lions game after the team’s coach, Rod Marinelli, told her he liked her perfume instead of answering her question. Ms. Andrews chimed in, saying, “I’ve done that, too,” for “a coach that I didn’t want to throw under the bus because he was telling me all the wrong stuff!”

Jill Fritzo, a spokeswoman for Ms. Andrews, said, “For her entire career, Erin Andrews has worked very closely with coaches, players and P.R. staffs to ensure accuracy in her reporting.” She added that what Ms. Andrews meant was that she took information from earlier meetings with coaches to include in her reports, and that when she was on the air she was always “clear” about where her information comes from.
Both women hold high-profile roles with enormous reach. Perhaps because of that, the public response by many of their counterparts was widespread.
Lisa Salters, the sideline reporter for ESPN’s “Monday Night Football,” posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, for the first time since March to say that Ms. Thompson’s remarks “called all sideline reporters into question.” Tracy Wolfson of CBS wrote on X that what Ms. Thompson described is “absolutely not ok, not the norm and upsetting on so many levels.”

Lesley Visser, who was the first female N.F.L. sideline reporter, said in an interview that “what I feel with that careless comment is that it’s almost like ground gained is not ground secured.” She added: “All of a sudden it’s, ‘They don’t matter, they’re eye candy.’ It is so deflating to me that ground gained is not ground secured. I thought that people wouldn’t be challenging that role in 2023.”
Neither Ms. Visser nor Laura Okmin, an N.F.L. broadcaster for Fox and on the radio for Westwood One, remembers sideline reporting being viewed as the role for women when she started out. Ms. Visser was preceded at ABC by the former player Lynn Swann. Ms. Okmin was drawn to the job in the early 2000s, because it was the chance to cover the game from an access point no other reporter had.
“Somewhere along the way, it’s turned into having to justify the value and the worth of this role,” Ms. Okmin said. “And not so coincidentally, it’s coincided with it really becoming a role of women.”
Ms. Okmin runs an organization called GALvanize to train and connect women pursuing careers in sports broadcasting, and she said she had received numerous questions about Ms. Thompson’s comments. The reactions spurred her to speak out publicly.
“When someone just goes, ‘I made it up sometimes,’ it’s a deeper cut than just a flippant comment,” she said. “It goes to the very core of us doing what we always do, which is justifying our role.”

Reporting from the sideline is a challenging assignment to do well. Veterans advise newcomers to wear sneakers, because they can expect to log at least five miles racing around the stadium. Sideline reporters must prepare all week to navigate weather, grumpy coaches, breaking news in real time and seconds-long windows in which to relay information to a television audience of millions.
And when they go back to their hotel rooms, some have had to deal with dangerous harassment from obsessive viewers.
Ms. Kremer, who spent decades reporting on sports and its major issues before five years as the sideline reporter for NBC’s “Sunday Night Football,” estimated that maybe 1 percent of the reporting she did leading up to the game would make it onto the air. Right before the kickoff of Super Bowl XLIII between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Arizona Cardinals, she reported that the Pittsburgh receiver Hines Ward had received a platelet-rich plasma injection to be able to play in the game. To report that news to a live television audience, Ms. Kremer confirmed it with three different people, including Mr. Ward at the walk-through the day before the game.
She said she believed the impact of Ms. Thompson’s admission would not be fleeting. “This even transcends just sideline reporting and sports, because in the climate in which we are in today, where fake news is part of the lexicon, somebody is admitting that they made something up,” Ms. Kremer said.
She added: “It’s just so difficult for all the hard-working people out there, who now have to have this as one more obstacle. I feel like an entire position, a whole role, got devalued and it was made a mockery of.”"
2023-11-18,"SpaceX, Elon Musk's spaceflight company, launched its Starship rocket from the coast of South Texas on Saturday, a mammoth vehicle that could alter the future of space transportation and help NASA return astronauts to the moon.
Saturday’s flight of Starship, a powerful vehicle designed to carry NASA astronauts to the moon, was not a complete success. SpaceX did not achieve the test launch’s ultimate objective — a partial trip around the world ending in a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.
But the test flight, the vehicle’s second, did show that the company had fixed key issues that arose during the earlier test operation in April. All 33 engines in the vehicle’s lower booster stage fired, and the rocket made it through stage separation — when the booster falls away and the six engines of the upper stage light up to carry the vehicle to space.
“Just beautiful,” John Insprucker, a SpaceX engineer and live launch commentator, said on the SpaceX webcast.

By contrast, the first Starship launch badly damaged the launch site; several engines on the booster failed, fires knocked out the steering of the rocket and the flight termination system took too long to explode.
According to SpaceX’s “fail fast, learn faster” approach toward rocket design, successfully avoiding a repeat of past failures counts as major progress.
However, the second flight revealed new challenges that Mr. Musk’s engineers must overcome.
Soon after stage separation, the booster exploded — a “rapid unscheduled disassembly,” in the jargon of rocket engineers. The upper-stage Starship spacecraft continued heading toward orbit for several more minutes, reaching an altitude of more than 90 miles, but then SpaceX lost contact with it after the flight termination system detonated.
In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said no injuries or property damage had been reported. It will conduct a mishap investigation, which is standard any time something goes wrong with a commercial rocket.

Engineers will now have to decipher what went wrong on both the booster and the upper-stage spacecraft, make fixes and then try again.
Starship is the biggest and most powerful rocket ever to fly. SpaceX aims to make both parts of the vehicle fully and rapidly reusable. That gives it the potential to launch bigger and heavier payloads to space and to significantly drive down the cost of lofting satellites, space telescopes, people and the things they need to live into space.
The test journey’s outcome was the latest split-screen moment in the career of Mr. Musk, a serial entrepreneur who previously transformed electronic payments with PayPal and electric cars with Tesla. As SpaceX prepared for the flight on Friday, Disney and Apple paused their ad spending with another one of his companies, the social network X, formerly known as Twitter, after Mr. Musk’s endorsement of an antisemitic post on Wednesday.
Many outside observers are optimistic that SpaceX will get Starship to work fully.

“They have fixed issues identified in their first flight and got further than ever before with this type of vehicle,” said Phil Larson, who served as a White House space adviser during President Barack Obama’s administration and later worked on communication efforts at SpaceX. “The magic of engineering is that it is all about learning, iterating the design, and reflying again soon.”

Daniel L. Dumbacher, the executive director of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, agreed. “This is a large launch system,” he said. “It’s going to take some work to get it to where it needs to go. I have no doubt that the SpaceX team will be able to figure out how to get the launch vehicle working.”
A couple of hours before sunrise on Saturday, liquid oxygen and liquid methane started flowing into the Starship. There was some fog near the ground but the skies above were clear, save for a few wisps of cirrus clouds.
The countdown proceeded smoothly, stopping at a planned hold with 40 seconds left on the countdown clock. Then the hold was lifted, the final seconds ticked away and, shortly after 7 a.m. Central time, the 400-foot-tall rocket slowly rose into the sky. A new water deluge system appears to have protected the launchpad, avoiding the cloud of dust and debris that rose up in April.
A few seconds later, the percussive roar buffeted spectators watching on South Padre Island, about five miles north of the launch site.
At 2 minutes, 48 seconds after liftoff, there was a flash as Starship successfully performed what had been expected to be the trickiest part of the flight — “hot staging,” when the six engines of the upper stage ignited before the booster dropped away. Loud cheers resonated from the SpaceX webcast, which was streaming from the company’s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif.

Half a minute later, there was a bigger flash when the booster — which was to splash in the Gulf of Mexico and sink — exploded. The upper stage continued onward unscathed. But then a few minutes later, the webcast fell into an uncomfortable silence when contact was lost with the Starship vehicle.
Many of the thousands of people who woke up early to take in the launch on South Padre Island said they had enjoyed the spectacle. By 4:30 a.m., a long line of cars were waiting in darkness to enter Isla Blanca Park at the south end of the South Padre. Others walked from their hotels to avoid the traffic. Boats packed with watchers floated just to the south, outside of the exclusion zone to the east.
The launch was experienced not just by those watching along the coast, but also those farther afield.
Emma Guevara, a resident of Brownsville, the city in South Texas that is west of the SpaceX launch site, said the event had made her house shake.

“It was way earlier than we all expected, so it woke everyone up,” said Ms. Guevara, who is a Sierra Club organizer and has protested operations at the company’s base.
Top NASA officials offered congratulations to SpaceX.
“Each test represents a step closer to putting the first woman on the Moon with the #Artemis III Starship human landing system.,” Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration systems development, wrote on X. “Looking forward to seeing what can be learned from this test that moves us closer to the next milestone.”
How quickly SpaceX solves the Starship issues could determine how soon NASA astronauts return to the moon.
The space agency has hired SpaceX to adapt Starship as a lunar lander to take two astronauts to the moon’s south polar regions. Even before the latest Starship test flight, the first landing, currently scheduled for late 2025, had already been considered likely to slip to 2026. SpaceX is also under contract to provide a Starship lander for the second crewed landing, scheduled for 2028.

For the moon landing, SpaceX would need not just one Starship but nearly 20 launches of the spacecraft, because a Starship headed to the moon would have to refill its propellant tanks before leaving Earth’s orbit.
For that, SpaceX is planning two other Starship variants.
One will essentially be an orbital gas station in space — a propellant depot in the language of space business. The other will be a tanker version to carry methane and liquid oxygen to the gas station. A series of tanker flights will be needed to fill the gas station. A Starship headed to the moon or Mars will launch and dock at the propellant depot and refill its tanks. But no one has yet tried pumping tons of propellants in a zero-gravity environment.
As a depot orbits Earth, it passes in and out of sunlight, and the outside of the depot will repeatedly warm and cool. Maintaining the propellants at steady, ultracold temperatures inside the depot will be a challenge.
At a meeting of a NASA Advisory Council committee on Friday, Lakiesha Hawkins, an assistant deputy associate administrator at NASA, said that the number of Starship launches would be in the “high teens.”
The Starships would launch “on a six-day rotation” from both the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the current Starship launch site in Texas, Ms. Hawkins said.
NASA does have a backup. This year, it selected a second lunar lander design from Blue Origin — the rocket company based in Kent, Wash., started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. That design is smaller and is planned for use in the third lunar landing, which will occur no earlier than 2029.

2023-11-19,"In recent years, much of my life as a consumer has shifted to what I like to call background spending. As I’ve subscribed to more apps and streaming platforms, significant sums of my money tend to drift away each month without my ever thinking about it. It’s as if it were a tax being taken out of my paycheck, one spent on something silly or indulgent like a subscription box of international snacks instead of — I don’t know — basic public infrastructure.
Think of it as automated capitalism. Spending without the hassle of spending. Acquisition without action. Or thought.
But while this swell of subscriptions was sold to me on the premise it would make my life more hassle-free, there was a certain sticker shock I felt upon discovering how much I was spending without realizing each month ($179.45) — after I’d already spent it, of course.
I can’t help feeling I’m being conned just a little. I admit I had forgotten I was paying monthly for the privilege of Apple TV+ after being hooked by the first season of “Ted Lasso,” then quickly falling off the bandwagon. When I reopened the app for the first time in eons, I was confronted with dozens of shows I’ve never heard of but to whose production budgets I’ve been contributing generously.

You see, the thing about background spending is it tends to happen, well, in the background without your full attention. And therein lies the point.
“Hand over your credit card details and let us take care of the rest,” these companies assure us. But by agreeing to this trade, we’ve become passive consumers who are allowing the balance of capitalism to tilt away from us. We have ceded one of our key powers as individuals: our agency."
2023-11-20,"While the visual appeal of jewelry — the sparkle of a gem or the glitter of gold — isn’t visible in an audio-only medium, podcasters specializing in jewelry seem to be flourishing.
But then, the overall audience for podcasts is growing, too, with the number of internet listeners worldwide set to top 504.9 million by 2024 from 274.8 million in 2019, according to Statista. And as the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford’s 2023 Digital News Report noted in June, these “listeners tend to be richer, better educated and crucially much younger,” with most between 18 and 34 years old.
Little wonder then that podcasters, even on a niche subject such as jewelry, want to capture this audience. After all, its members are “not like flicking through like much of the internet behavior can be or like TikTok can be — just scrolling, scrolling through to the next bit,” said Rob Parkin, a London-based senior vice president of research and insight at Pulsar, an audience intelligence company.
Here are the stories of four jewelry specialists from Stockholm to Santa Monica, Calif., most of whom established their free podcasts to promote their businesses or institutions, and now are working on ways to grow.

“Gem Pursuit”
Dublin
As Ireland endured weeks of lockdown in early 2020, Matthew Weldon was trying to find a way to boost business for his antique and vintage jewelry store, Courtville, in central Dublin.
His answer was a podcast called “Gem Pursuit,” a name that he said was a take on his business goal: “to pursue the finest gems.” Since its debut that May, the podcast has offered 56 episodes, which are uploaded on alternate Mondays.
And as of early November, it had a total of 60,090 downloads across its platforms, including Apple Podcasts and Spotify.
The episodes range from about 30 minutes to almost 90 minutes, and have focused on gemstones, from diamonds to onyx; design eras, including Art Deco; and well-known houses such as Cartier.

Mr. Weldon, 34, and his co-host, Alyce Ketcher, “decide who takes what” in advance, so the discussion flows without a script. For example, when they planned the “Emerald” episode for December 2020, “Alyce would pick one emerald and I’d pick a different one and then we’d, kind of, tell each other the story of it,” Mr. Weldon said.

They also stage a little quiz competition at the program’s end, each fielding three questions. In the “Opal” episode in August, Mr. Weldon asked Ms. Ketcher which Shakespeare play contains the line “for thy mind is a very opal?” (Answer: “Twelfth Night”).
That time Ms. Ketcher, 37, won the game with two correct answers. She is a gemologist who joined Courtville in February 2020 as head of fine jewelry and has been the podcast’s co-host since its inception.

Planning is the toughest part, Mr. Weldon said. Each podcast series is organized two or three months ahead and each episode is planned two weeks in advance, he said. “A lot of our listeners are in the trade anyway or young people trying to get into the trade so it can’t be information that just anyone can tell them, it has to be researched” and has to be correct, he said, estimating that an episode could involve 10 to 12 hours of research.
Since Sept. 29, however, responsibility for that research has shifted to Dusty Rhodes, the series’ new producer and founder of DustPod, a podcast production house in Dublin. So, Mr. Weldon wrote in a recent text message, “Alyce and I really just have to turn up now.”

“Jewelry Journey”
Santa Monica, Calif.
Sharon Berman, a collector of art and pre-owned jewelry, became intrigued by the intense interest in jewelry that many of her fellow collectors showed at conferences and events. So in October 2018, she began “Jewelry Journey,” a self-funded podcast series of profiles. (She also was founder of Berbay Marketing & Public Relations, a company she sold in January 2022.)
As of mid-November, Ms. Berman, 66, had hosted 211 episodes, most about 30 minutes long. Many were two-part programs as, she said, they attract more listeners and provide more time to “really start digging into why somebody became a jeweler, or what keeps them creative.” (When she does a two-parter, the first segment publishes on Tuesday, and the second on Thursday or Friday.)
“I only pick things that I think the audience will find interesting,” she said, such as the jewelry career of Cameron Silver, founder of the vintage couture boutique Decades in Los Angeles and the fashion director at Halston. In his episode, he told Ms. Berman that he “was probably interested in jewelry before fashion,” as “my great-grandparents were in the diamond business in Chicago so it’s probably in my DNA.”
Once Ms. Berman completes a video interview at her home office in Santa Monica, she sends the file to her stepdaughter, Aleah Kramer, 36, a photographer in Los Angeles. Ms. Kramer edits the episode and uploads each audio file to podcast platforms such as Libsyn for Google Play and Stitcher and to the social media scheduler Later, for Instagram, Facebook and X, formerly called Twitter.
In addition to the podcasts, Ms. Berman posts bonus elements such as photographs and episode transcripts on the “Jewelry Journey” website. It also has a prompt that asks visitors to suggest future guests as, she said, “there are a lot of people out there I don’t know.”
“To spice it up,” Ms. Berman said, she now is considering requiring subscriptions so, for “the juicier stuff, you pay for it.”

“The Jewelry Podcast”
Stockholm
Even though there are only 14 episodes of “The Jewelry Podcast” — no new ones have been released since September 2021 — it still seems to have word-of-mouth momentum. There were five free downloads on Nov. 7 and 283 during the previous 30 days, according to Acast, the podcast’s distribution platform.
The episodes are translations of the Swedish-language podcast Smyckespodden (pronounced SMEE-kes-podden), founded in January 2021 by Cecilia Kores, the designer and chief executive of the fine jewelry brand Mumbaistockholm. And while she said she intends to do more English language episodes, she currently is concentrating on the Swedish version.
Its name “is a combination of the word ‘Smycken,’ which means jewelry in Swedish, and ‘podden,’ which means ‘the podcast’,” Ms. Kores, 34, wrote in a text message. She had said during an earlier video interview that the podcast was meant to help people build a fine jewelry collection in a fun, democratic way, as “you normally talk about fashion or clothes or sports.”
Topics of the episodes, which generally run 60 to 90 minutes, have included what to do with an old engagement ring and how to avoid what Ms. Kores called the seven sins of shopping, including: “Don’t get tunnel vision and get caught up on your specifications list because then you might miss all other beautiful stones out there.”
And, as of early November, the Swedish podcast had a total of 48,829 downloads, according to the podcast support business Acast.
Every other Friday Ms. Kores records a new episode in Stockholm at the recording studio of the financial news organization Finwire, paying 2,500 Swedish kronor ($235) for recording and editing. She then uploads the audio file to Acast, which distributes her podcast to international and Swedish platforms like Apple Podcast, Poddtoppen and Podtail.

Developing the Swedish podcast is a priority, Ms. Kores said, noting that she recently began a weekly series of 10- to 15-minute episodes on themes such as pearls.
“BAJ Podcast”
London
Artificial Intelligence, sustainability and “smart” jewelry have been just some of the themes of the newsy “BAJ Podcast,” the voice of the British Academy of Jewellery, a not-for-profit social enterprise with campuses in London, Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham and Leicester.
As of early November, the podcast has issued 52 episodes and tallied 13,100 downloads since its founding in April 2020 by Sofie Boons. She was the academy’s principal until 2019, and now, is the podcast’s host, a member of its board and working on a doctorate specializing in man-made crystals at the University of the West of England in Bristol, known as UWE Bristol.
Ms. Boons edits her own sound files at her home office in Bristol, and then the academy posts them on Fridays to the hosting platform Podbean, which automatically sends them to its website, Amazon and TuneIn, among other platforms. (Ms. Boons said she learned about sound and video editing in 2011-2013 while studying for a Master of Arts in gold smithing, silver smithing, metalwork and jewelry at the Royal College of Art in London. )
The podcasts, ranging from 20 minutes to more than an hour, offer conversations with academy tutors, artisans and jewelry specialists. In November 2022, for example, Tianne-Louise Simmons, an academy graduate, told Ms. Boons what it was like to compete last year in the second (and final) season of the BBC’s jewelry show, “All That Glitters.”
And in October, Rachel Church, an academy lecturer and a former jewelry curator at the Victoria & Albert museum, talked with Ms. Boons about the role of a curator.
“You might be typing up lists or ticking things off in a store or crawling around on your hands and knees, finding out why the light in the case isn’t coming on and how to get it fixed before the museum opens at 10 a.m.,” she said on the podcast."
2023-11-21,"There was the coup that hit the headlines: the OpenAI board’s abrupt ousting of its co-founder and chief executive, Sam Altman. Now we are on the verge of a second, even more critical coup, one that cements control of one of the most powerful and promising technologies on the planet under one of this country’s tech titans.
Monday, it was announced that Microsoft was hiring Mr. Altman and another OpenAI co-founder, Greg Brockman. Microsoft had already invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI; its absorption of OpenAI leadership — and the likely hiring of hundreds of OpenAI staff members who signed a letter saying they would leave to join Microsoft unless the board resigned — effectively completes its takeover. OpenAI may find some way out of this self-induced disaster, but any solution would probably require satisfying its infuriated investors by making its board more accountable to their interests.
There’s no small irony that OpenAI’s board, which reportedly was worried about the safety of its hugely popular product, triggered events that will probably shift it to leaders more beholden to market pressures for fast growth. The likely outcome of this fracas is a nail in the coffin of the most prominent effort to build a noncommercial version of artificial intelligence that would serve the public at least as much as it sought profits.
OpenAI was founded in 2015 with the explicit mission of building an alternative to the for-profit A.I. models being developed elsewhere. It was established as a nonprofit, and its stated mission is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But ultimately, the cost of building A.I. was too expensive to attract investors to a nonprofit. The cost of training just one of OpenAI’s chatbots, GPT-4, is estimated to be $100 million. So in 2019, OpenAI set up a hybrid model: It remained a nonprofit but set up a commercial arm that it called a “hybrid of a for-profit and a nonprofit” that it said would “increase our ability to raise capital.”
The hybrid model allowed Microsoft to invest billions of dollars and acquire a 49 percent ownership stake in the for-profit arm of OpenAI. (The nonprofit parent owns just 2 percent.) In other words, Microsoft had already acquired a large interest in the promising start-up. Poaching its employees would be barely more than a formality, albeit one made much easier by the clueless actions of OpenAI’s board."

2023-11-23,"This article is from Headway, an initiative from The New York Times exploring the world’s challenges through the lens of progress. Headway looks for promising solutions, notable experiments and lessons from what has been tried.
Jack Walker is a union man. He drives a garbage truck in Memphis, where his route can take him barreling past shotgun-style houses along the Mississippi River and down the narrow alleyways near the Lorraine Motel, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. He is aware, always, of how his union protections are tied to Dr. King’s death and that of another man: his father.
Robert Walker, Mr. Walker’s father, was also a sanitation worker. On Feb. 1, 1968, he was collecting garbage when sheets of rain started pouring down. He and his colleague Echol Cole took shelter in the compactor of their truck. When a compressing piston malfunctioned, the two men were crushed. The city had no intention to pay death benefits, offering Robert Walker’s widow only $500 for funeral expenses, “if you need it,” as the official letter put it. She had five children, including Jack, and was pregnant with a sixth.
The tragedy was a culmination of slow-burning indignities for Black sanitation workers in Memphis. They earned low wages to lug heavy, open tubs of refuse to their trucks. Rotting garbage seeped onto their skin and clothes. Their white colleagues, who were often drivers, showered at the depot at the end of their shifts. But the Black collectors were forced to ride the bus or walk home in their dank clothes covered in flecks of trash and maggots.
Fed up, they called a strike. Roughly 1,300 sanitation workers began marching through the streets of Memphis. They carried signs that read “I Am a Man,” with the “Am” underlined. The strike stretched on for weeks. Even as trash began to accumulate on city streets, Memphis’s mayor wouldn’t entertain the strikers’ demands, instead sending in police officers with clubs and mace to break up marches.

The strikers’ mission and bravery spoke to Dr. King, who had embarked on a new economic justice effort, the Poor People’s Campaign. He came to Memphis in March and again in April, when, at a local church, he gave an impassioned speech that would turn out to be his last.
Two weeks after Dr. King was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, the Memphis City Council voted to recognize the sanitation workers’ union, promising higher wages to the largely Black work force.
“It was a first step in getting them on their feet financially,” said Lee Saunders, the current president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. “It was a huge deal.”
The strike in Memphis more than five decades ago “inspired a surge of organizing and strikes, not unlike what we see today,” said William P. Jones, a history professor at the University of Minnesota who has written on race and class.
Today’s resurgence in labor activism cuts across a broad range of industries. There have been recent labor fights at, among other places, rail yards, schools, hospitals, hotels, Hollywood studios and Starbucks stores. And the issues on the bargaining table include traditional demands, like higher wages and better staffing levels, as well as protections against replacement by artificial intelligence. Unions have had remarkable success in recent months, including securing a big pay raise for Las Vegas hospitality workers who merely threatened a strike.

What the Black sanitation workers in Memphis demonstrated was that, by joining a union and withholding their labor, even people in the lowest-paying, hardest jobs could “transform those jobs into reliable vehicles for economic mobility,” Dr. Jones said. And that, he added, led “to a rapid expansion of public-sector unions in the 1970s and 1980s and the emergence of African Americans as the most heavily unionized sector of the American work force.”

‘Great Strides Have Been Made’

Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times
Today, Black workers have the highest union membership rate of any racial or ethnic group. Even so, Black union workers make less than their white counterparts — $1,022 a week on average compared with $1,246 for white workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Gary Hoover, a professor of economics at Tulane University, said that the gap probably stemmed from the fact that Black workers get fewer opportunities for promotions. Still, Dr. Hoover said, Black Americans have gravitated toward union jobs because they offer better protections than nonunion jobs. “You’re looking for job security,” he said, “and some form of protection from discrimination.”
Those protections are harder to come by now. The union membership rate of U.S. workers was 10.1 percent in 2022, a big drop from 20.1 percent in 1983, when the federal government first began compiling comparable data. That decrease was driven, in part, by the decline of manufacturing in this country and the spread of factories to states, largely in the South, that prohibited unions from forcing workers to pay dues. Voters in Tennessee passed an amendment last year to enshrine such a ban in the state’s Constitution.

Labor activists around the country are trying to stave off further decline and establish unions in new industries. Throughout the first 10 months of this year, 492,300 workers have gone on strike — more than three times as many workers as in the same period last year, according to a labor action tracker from Cornell University. Picket lines are on the nightly news, including one in September in the Detroit area where President Biden joined members of the United Automobile Workers union.
There have been significant victories in recent months. Nearly 75,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers went on strike nationwide, securing large pay increases, including a $25-an-hour minimum wage in California. In September, after a monthslong strike, the Writers Guild of America agreed to a 12.5 percent pay increase over a three-year contract and, two months later, SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, got a 7 percent raise in the first year of its contract. Perhaps most notably, the U.A.W. held an innovative strike against the Big 3 automakers that led to a 25 percent wage increase over the next four and half years.
“Great strides have been made,” said Martin Luther King III, Dr. King’s elder son. Mr. King, 66, who often marches in solidarity with union members, said that the labor movement felt more energized over the past year than at any other moment in his lifetime.
Dr. Jones noted that “most of the big gains have come in sectors where unions are well established and have the legal protections to strike and win concessions,” like the automobile industry and Hollywood. Early successes unionizing Amazon workers have stalled. And workers in industries like ride-sharing or food service have had a harder time winning union recognition. “In that respect,” he said, “workers at Starbucks or Uber are fighting for the same rights to decent wages, working conditions and union representation that the Memphis sanitation workers demanded in 1968.”

‘Those Brothers Went Through a Lot’

Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times
On a recent morning, dozens of garbage trucks rumbled along a road past the iron gates of a sanitation building on the southern end of Memphis. The air was thick and rancid. Most trucks were operated by a driver and a collector, who hops out of the truck at each stop and hoists the debris from the cans into the compactor. Their shifts start at 7 a.m., sometimes stretching for 12 hours.
Memphis has embraced its place in civil rights and labor history. Images of Black sanitation workers holding the iconic “I Am a Man” sign are plastered on plaques and murals across the city. In 2017, city officials gave $70,000 grants to more than a dozen workers who were part of the union in 1968. The mayor praised their “courage and resolve.”
A lot has improved, Mr. Walker said, since his father’s time. Back then, most Black men in the department could work only as trash collectors, not drivers; today, Mr. Walker is a driver. But sanitation work in Memphis is still dangerous. In interviews, some city sanitation workers described persistent safety concerns, such as coming into contact with carcasses of rabid dogs and acid splatter from batteries. Patricia Moore, 52, who worked at a private sanitation company, Republic Services, was killed in March when she was crushed beneath a truck at a landfill in Memphis. She had worked for the company for 30 years.
After the accident, workers with Teamsters Local 667, which represents Republic employees, walked off the job and initiated a nine-day strike, eventually getting a new five-year contract with pay increases of up to 28 percent an hour over the span of the agreement. It also included additional funding for safety equipment and gear.
For city sanitation workers, pay remains an issue. Marquize Cast, 40, joined the sanitation department as a driver in 2009. He grew up hearing stories about the 1968 strike from his grandmother, and working as a sanitation worker gives him a sense of pride, he said.

“Those brothers went through a lot,” he remembered thinking.
But with two children and mounting bills, his pay — he began at around $14 an hour and now makes around $21 — wasn’t enough. A few years after he started at the sanitation department, he took a second job as a night janitor at an elementary school.
Mr. Cast spoke about the brotherhood he felt with fellow sanitation workers — sharing laughter and meals, swapping shifts to help one another out. But he has seen co-workers leave for nonunion jobs with better pay at FedEx, which has its headquarters in the city, and at large warehouses stocked with freight at the Memphis International Airport.
“Mentally and physically, the job can break you down,” he said about working in sanitation.
The same has been true for Mr. Walker. The repetitive motion of getting in and out of the truck for 40 years has worn on his joints. Sometimes he wonders if the city really appreciates the work of people like him.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Walker sat outside Local 1733’s main offices. Nearby, a plaque attached to a lamppost read “1968 Strikers Lane” — a small reminder, like so many others in this city, of the father taken from him when he was a boy.
Mr. Walker looked in the direction of the plaque. He thought about his father, “a strong, healthy man,” he said, “who just wanted to provide for his family.”

Do you, your parents or your grandparents have a connection to unions?
This story is part of a series, Progress, Revisited, in which we’re exploring both progress toward and regression from racial equity and justice for Black Americans. You just read about how a strike by Memphis sanitation workers in 1968 opened opportunities for Black workers in the worst-paying jobs. Today, as Kurtis Lee tells us, Black workers have the highest union membership rate of any racial or ethnic group. Yet, Black union workers make less than white ones. The Memphis sanitation strike was more than 50 years ago. And as you can read, some things have progressed while others have not. What do you think? We’d especially like to hear from people who have union affiliations that span multiple generations.

2023-11-25,"Meta has received more than 1.1 million reports of users under the age of 13 on its Instagram platform since early 2019 yet it “disabled only a fraction” of those accounts, according to a newly unsealed legal complaint against the company brought by the attorneys general of 33 states.
Instead, the social media giant “routinely continued to collect” children’s personal information, like their locations and email addresses, without parental permission, in violation of a federal children’s privacy law, according to the court filing. Meta could face hundreds of millions of dollars, or more, in civil penalties should the states prove the allegations.
“Within the company, Meta’s actual knowledge that millions of Instagram users are under the age of 13 is an open secret that is routinely documented, rigorously analyzed and confirmed,” the complaint said, “and zealously protected from disclosure to the public.”
The privacy charges are part of a larger federal lawsuit, filed last month by California, Colorado and 31 other states in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit accuses Meta of unfairly ensnaring young people on its Instagram and Facebook platforms while concealing internal studies showing user harms. And it seeks to force Meta to stop using certain features that the states say have harmed young users.

But much of the evidence cited by the states was blacked out by redactions in the initial filing.
Now the unsealed complaint, filed on Wednesday evening, provides new details from the states’ lawsuit. Using snippets from internal emails, employee chats and company presentations, the complaint contends that Instagram for years “coveted and pursued” underage users even as the company “failed” to comply with the children’s privacy law.
The unsealed filing said that Meta “continually failed” to make effective age-checking systems a priority and instead used approaches that enabled users under 13 to lie about their age to set up Instagram accounts. It also accused Meta executives of publicly stating in congressional testimony that the company’s age-checking process was effective and that the company removed underage accounts when it learned of them — even as the executives knew there were millions of underage users on Instagram.
“Tweens want access to Instagram, and they lie about their age to get it now,” Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, said in an internal company chat in November 2021, according to the court filing.
In Senate testimony the following month, Mr. Mosseri said: “If a child is under the age of 13, they are not permitted on Instagram.”
In a statement on Saturday, Meta said that it had spent a decade working to make online experiences safe and age-appropriate for teenagers and that the states’ complaint “mischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents.”

The statement also noted that Instagram’s terms of use prohibit users under the age of 13 in the United States. And it said that the company had “measures in place to remove these accounts when we identify them.”
The company added that verifying people’s ages was a “complex” challenge for online services, especially with younger users who may not have school IDs or driver’s licenses. Meta said it would like to see federal legislation that would require “app stores to get parents’ approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps” rather than having young people or their parents supply personal details like birth dates to many different apps.
The privacy charges in the case center on a 1998 federal law, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. That law requires that online services with content aimed at children obtain verifiable permission from a parent before collecting personal details — like names, email addresses or selfies — from users under 13. Fines for violating the law can run to more than $50,000 per violation.
The lawsuit argues that Meta elected not to build systems to effectively detect and exclude such underage users because it viewed children as a crucial demographic — the next generation of users — that the company needed to capture to assure continued growth.
Meta had many indicators of underage users, according to the Wednesday filing. An internal company chart displayed in the unsealed material, for example, showed how Meta tracked the percentage of 11- and 12-year-olds who used Instagram daily, the complaint said.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Meta also knew about accounts belonging to specific underage Instagram users through company reporting channels. But it “automatically” ignored certain reports of users under 13 and allowed them to continue using their accounts, the complaint said, as long as the accounts did not contain a user biography or photos.
In one case in 2019, Meta employees discussed in emails why the company had not deleted four accounts belonging to a 12-year-old, despite requests and “complaints from the girl’s mother stating her daughter was 12,” according to the complaint. The employees concluded that the accounts were “ignored” partly because Meta representatives “couldn’t tell for sure the user was underage,” the legal filing said.
This is not the first time the social media giant has faced allegations of privacy violations. In 2019, the company agreed to pay a record $5 billion, and to alter its data practices, to settle charges from the Federal Trade Commission of deceiving users about their ability to control their privacy.
It may be easier for the states to pursue Meta for children’s privacy violations than to prove that the company encouraged compulsive social media use — a relatively new phenomenon — among young people. Since 2019, the F.T.C. has successfully brought similar children’s privacy complaints against tech giants including Google and its YouTube platform, Amazon, Microsoft and Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite."

2023-11-27,"One reason that the idea of free trade has fallen out of fashion in recent years is the perception that trade agreements reflect the wishes of big American corporations, at everybody else’s expense.
U.S. officials fought for trade agreements that protect intellectual property — and drug companies got the chance to extend the life of patents, raising the price of medicine around the world. U.S. officials fought for investor protections — and mining companies got the right to sue for billions in “lost profit” if a country moved to protect its drinking water or the Amazon ecosystem. And for years, U.S. officials have fought for digital trade rules that allow data to move freely across national borders — prompting fears that the world’s most powerful tech companies would use those rules to stay ahead of competitors and shield themselves from regulations aimed at protecting consumers and privacy.
That’s why the Biden administration, which came into office promising to fight for trade agreements that better reflect the interests of ordinary people, has dropped its advocacy for tech-friendly digital trade rules that American officials have championed for more than a decade.
Last month, President Biden’s trade representative, Katherine Tai, notified the World Trade Organization that the American government no longer supported a proposal it once spearheaded that would have exported the American laissez-faire approach to tech. Had that proposal been adopted, it would have spared tech companies the headache of having to deal with many different domestic laws about how data must be handled, including rules mandating that it be stored or analyzed locally. It also would have largely shielded tech companies from regulations aimed at protecting citizens’ privacy and curbing monopolistic behavior.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The move to drop support for that digital trade agenda has been pilloried as a disaster for American companies and a boon to China, which has a host of complicated restrictions on transferring data outside of China. “We have warned for years that either the United States would write the rules for digital trade or China would,” Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, lamented in a press statement. “Now, the Biden administration has decided to give China the pen.”

The truth is that Ms. Tai is taking the pen away from Meta, Google and Amazon, which helped shape the previous policy, according to a research paper published this year by Wendy Li, a doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who used to answer the phone and interact with lobbyists at the U.S. trade representative’s office. The paper includes redacted emails between Trump-era trade negotiators and lobbyists for Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon, exchanging suggestions for the proposed text for the policy on digital trade in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. “While they were previously ‘allergic to Washington,’ as one trade negotiator described, over the course of a decade, technology companies hired lobbyists and joined trade associations with the goal of proactively influencing international trade policy,” Ms. Li wrote in the Socio-Economic Review."

Shein, the popular fast-fashion retailer, has big I.P.O. ambitions.

Cooper Neill for The New York Times
Shein aims to win over Wall Street and Washington
In filing confidentially for an initial public offering, Shein, the ultrafast-fashion retailer, is showing ambition on two fronts.
The company and its underwriters are betting that investors will be more receptive to I.P.O.s, even though high-profile market debuts this fall largely fizzled out. Shein is also testing whether it can endure what’s likely to be an increase in political heat on the China-founded e-commerce giant.
The company has cut some of its most prominent ties to China, after drawing pushback from Washington. Some of its changes have included moving its headquarters to Singapore and de-registering its original incorporation in Nanjing. The company has also set up operations in Ireland and Indiana and hired an array of lobbyists in the U.S.
But that hasn’t been enough to erase the scrutiny. “No one should be fooled by Shein’s efforts to cover its tracks,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, wrote in a letter to other lawmakers.

Accusations of forced labor are a major concern. Shein has been dogged by allegations that it has sourced material from Xinjiang; the U.S. has sought to ban imports of clothing from the region in northwest China, citing human rights abuses of the Uyghur ethnic minority there.
Last year, Bloomberg reported that some Shein products were made with Xinjiang cotton. Members of Congress and state attorneys general have pushed the S.E.C. to require that the company certify through an independent process that it doesn’t use Uyghur forced labor. (The company has said it has “zero tolerance” for the practice and has no manufacturers in Xinjiang.)
Shein is also hoping that investors will welcome an I.P.O. Bankers had hoped that the long-moribund market for new listings would reopen this fall with offerings from the chip designer Arm, the grocery delivery service Instacart and the sandal maker Birkenstock. Instead, those debuts quickly busted.
But deal-makers say 2024 is a better bet for I.P.O.s because of improving economic and market conditions. (And both Arm and Birkenstock have since seen their shares climb above their listing prices.) Shein — which is working with JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — also has high hopes for its valuation, now said to be at $66 billion.

The retailer isn’t the only well-known company betting on an I.P.O. revival: Reddit is reportedly testing the waters for an offering, and the luxury sneaker maker Golden Goose is said to be taking steps toward a listing as well.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Israel and Hamas extend their cease-fire. The tenuous agreement opens the door for more aid to flow into Gaza and the potential release of more hostages and prisoners. It comes a day after Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and Elon Musk toured the site of a deadly Hamas attack on Israelis; Musk is seeking to allay concerns that he has fueled antisemitic sentiment on his X social media platform.
Barclays is reportedly weighing a big cull of investment banking clients. Such an overhaul is meant to cut about $1 billion in costs and raise capital, and would focus on less-profitable clients, according to The Financial Times. High interest rates and a slowing of the global economy have crimped Barclays’ core businesses like lending and deal-making.
E.U. regulators air concerns about Amazon’s $1.7 billion takeover bid for iRobot. Shares in the maker of robot vacuum cleaners tumbled on Monday after antitrust officials in Brussels warned that a takeover could hurt competition. The European Commission is planning to issue a ruling on the deal by February.
Sports Illustrated deletes articles following furor over A.I.-generated content. An investigation by Futurism found that several articles on the publication’s website carried author pictures and profiles that had been conjured up via artificial intelligence. The Arena Group, which has published Sports Illustrated since 2019, said that an outside vendor had created the questionable content.

Europe’s tech scene stages a partial recovery
Last year was tough for the European technology industry, as some $400 billion worth of company valuations evaporated amid market volatility and a worsening economy.
Now, 12 months later, things are looking better, according to the latest annual survey by Atomico, the venture capital firm. But the challenges that stunted growth in 2022 are likely to persist for some time.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Valuations have partially come back, according to Atomico: The total valuation of private and publicly traded tech companies rose to $3 trillion, restoring last year’s losses and returning to levels set during the boom times of 2021.
While the underlying data offer some reason for caution — most of that rise was because of rebounding public market values — there was also cause for optimism. Valuations in the private market are back to their five- and 10-year averages for the most part, though they remain down from 2021 levels.
Just seven new companies reached “unicorn” status by gaining a valuation of $1 billion. That’s down from 108 in 2021 and 48 last year. Meanwhile, the number of “dehorned” unicorns, or those who fell below the $1 billion threshold, has reached 50 in 2023, down slightly from 58 last year.

European start-ups need more capital. Total investments in the tech sector are expected to hit $45 billion this year, down 45 percent from 2022. (That’s still the third-highest year on record.) The number of so-called fund-raising mega-rounds in Europe fell to just 36 this year, down from 163 in 2022.
That’s in part because Europe saw an almost total drop in activity from those known as crossover investors, like Tiger Global and Coatue, who pour large amounts of money into late-stage start-ups. It doesn’t help, Atomico argues, that European pension funds continue to invest just a tiny fraction of their assets in the continent’s venture capital firms.
Other notable findings from the report:
Climate-focused start-ups now represent 27 percent of all European venture investments.
Europe is drawing more tech workers, including from the U.S., than it’s losing. The continent now has more A.I.-focused professionals than in the U.S., though many of them still work for American tech giants including Alphabet and Meta.
The outlook for investors to exit start-ups remains unclear, given the still-rocky market for initial public offerings. But buyers, including both corporations and private equity firms, are still showing interest in acquiring tech start-ups.
When it works to pay for access to Xi
Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, got a warm welcome earlier this month at a banquet in San Francisco attended by American C.E.O.s hoping for a return to improved U.S.-China business ties. Details of what went on behind the scenes are beginning to emerge.
The C.E.O. of Broadcom, whose $69 billion takeover of VMware had been stymied by Beijing regulators, paid $40,000 to sit at Xi’s table, according to The Wall Street Journal. (Mastercard and Boeing were among the dinner’s underwriters.) But the expense appears to have been worth it, The Journal reports:
A few days after the dinner, China signed off on Broadcom’s deal. Beijing also gave a long-awaited green light to New York-based payments processor Mastercard to issue yuan-denominated cards bearing its brand in the country.
Some observers saw the moves as olive branches to American corporations as firms grow wary of doing business in China. The moves also show how companies can become pawns in the intensifying geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing.
Boeing, however, hasn’t seen that level of success: It still hasn’t struck a deal to sell more planes in China.

Deepali Gupta plays herself in “United States v. Gupta.”

Marcus Middleton
Rajat Gupta, the musical
In 2012, when Rajat Gupta, the former C.E.O. of the consulting giant McKinsey, was being tried for insider trading, his wife and four daughters sat in the front row of the spectators’ gallery day after day.
Now, his youngest daughter, Deepali Gupta, 33, has fashioned some of those moments into what she calls a musical tragedy, weaving the public spectacle of the scandal with her family’s internal struggles and her own troubled relationship with her father, writes The Times’s Anupreeta Das for DealBook. The musical, “United States v. Gupta,” ends its run tonight at the 50-seat Brooklyn performance space Jack.

Deepali, a performance artist, composer and playwright, plays herself. The story is told through her perspective, using songs, transcripts, news clips (including from DealBook) and remembered conversations. Actors play multiple roles: bombastic lawyers, courtroom artists and even Judge Jed Rakoff. One actor dons a bald cap for a minute to play the former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein. Rajat’s family members express their boredom while sharing snacks and candy.
The focus is less on Rajat’s fall from grace than on how it devastated his family. Once an adviser to dozens of Fortune 500 chief executives and a hero to many achievement-oriented Indian Americans, Rajat was found guilty of conspiracy and securities fraud for leaking confidential information about Goldman to Raj Rajaratnam, a friend who was then a billionaire hedge fund manager. Rajat was eventually sentenced to prison.
When the play’s characters visit him, there are touching displays of familial intimacy — a mother dealing with a snacking habit (jalapeño Cheetos), a father and daughter playing a card game (Sweep) — even as they tiptoe around the elephant in the room.
Deepali said the idea for the play took shape during the trial, when she was 22. Writing it allowed her to reassess what she remembered, the media portrayals of the trial and how her family had protected her from the ups and downs, she said in an interview, adding that she found it “therapeutic.”
Since being released in 2017, Rajat has tried to rebuild his reputation. In 2019, he published “Mind Without Fear,” about his side of the case. But the play ends with a question from Deepali to her father: “Are you a good man?”

2023-11-29,"The choice of a leading oil producer, the United Arab Emirates, to host this year’s U.N. climate talks has angered environmental activists. But for the Emirates and other countries both highly dependent on oil and deeply vulnerable to rising temperatures, grappling with climate change is an urgent dilemma for them, too.
If the world abandons oil too quickly, the powerful authoritarian state that the Emirati rulers have built in 50 years could crumble as the revenue that finances most of their budget dwindles. Yet, if the world moves away from oil too slowly, the sliver of land they call home could become a wasteland by the time their grandchildren grow old: Scientists warn that the unmitigated burning of fossil fuels could eventually send temperatures in the Emirates soaring beyond the limits that humans can survive.
It is an extreme example of the choices faced by many other countries as well in a world addicted to fossil fuels.
“Our leadership are very future-oriented and already many years ago understood how important it is for us to diversify,” Mariam Almheiri, the Emirati minister of climate change and environment, said in an interview last week.
The Emirates was one of the first countries in the Gulf region to invest in renewable energy and develop industries beyond oil, including aviation, ports and tourism.
“Time is not on our side,” Ms. Almheiri said. “We cannot wait another two or three years to make any big movements.”

2023-11-30,"First, Jeff Bezos’ new megayacht was too big to pass under a bridge in the Netherlands. Now, the massive vessel’s size — it’s more than 400 feet long — has played a role in preventing it from keeping company with other private yachts in Port Everglades, Fla., where it is anchored.
Instead, the megayacht, named Koru, is hanging with huge oil tankers and general container ships. The yacht is docked there because of its size and also because of what berths were available in the seaport, according to a spokeswoman for Port Everglades.
Koru is a sailing yacht, unlike the much bigger diesel-powered boats popular with other billionaires. It is the largest sailing yacht in the world, according to Oceanco, the Dutch company that finished building the boat earlier this year.
The deck space of the three-masted schooner has three Jacuzzis and a swimming pool. The inside has a “timeless, contemporary style,” according to Oceanco, with natural wood tones, warm neutrals, and patterned textiles. It also includes a mermaid on the bow that appears to resemble Mr. Bezos’ partner, Lauren Sánchez.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Koru, which Bloomberg estimated cost about $500 million to build, arrived to the Florida port on Nov. 22 after departing from Gibraltar earlier this month, according to Marine Traffic, a real-time maritime data platform.
It was unclear why exactly Mr. Bezos docked his yacht there, but earlier this month he said that he would be moving back to Miami to be closer to his parents and to Ms. Sánchez.
Mr. Bezos had since 1994 lived in Seattle, where he started Amazon from his garage. He has already purchased two mansions in South Florida, one for $68 million and another for $79 million, according to Bloomberg News.
Bloomberg estimated his net worth to be $171 billion.
Port Everglades charges yachts larger than 400 feet at least $309.50 per 24 hours. Ships that have been closest to Koru include a more-than 610-foot-long oil tanker named Magnolia State.
Koru is Maori for “coil” or “loop” and has come to symbolize new life, growth, and peace in traditional Maori art.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Bezos’ journey with his new yacht started off rocky. Last year, city officials in Rotterdam, the Dutch city, initially agreed to dismantle De Hef, a 95-year-old bridge, so that Koru could pass through it from the nearby city where it had been built. The dismantling process would have taken more than a day, and putting it back together would have too. But after uproar from the community — including calls to throw eggs at the boat as it would have passed — Oceanco decided against it and the yacht was towed to a different location to have its masts attached.

This roundup will at least get you started with many of the major streamers’ new offerings.
‘A Christmas Frequency’
Stream it on Hulu.
Hulu scored with “Happiest Season” three years ago, but its originals are not very exciting this year. In this slow-paced rom-com, the radio producer Kenzie (Ansley Gordon) must help her boss, Brooke (Denise Richards), hide the fact that she has split up from her husband — not a good look for someone who dispenses relationship advice to her listeners. As Kenzie tries to set up Brooke on dates to shore up both her romantic life and the show’s ratings, she ends up finding love for herself with a nice dude (Jonathan Stoddard) who works in the same building. Good thing some people still turn up in the office IRL.

‘Best. Christmas. Ever!’
Stream it on Netflix.
Netflix really opened itself up to jokes with this dud’s title. Mary Lambert’s feature could have explored the not-very-nice feelings of envy the holidays can create, but it’s just an unfunny mess filled with grating people. Chief among them is Charlotte (Heather Graham), who mistakenly ends up at the lavish house of her friend Jackie (Brandy Norwood) for Christmas. Jackie has a dream life with her soul mate (Matt Cedeño), while Charlotte is stagnating and married to a nice guy (Jason Biggs) — the horror. If nothing else, the movie boasts the incongruous sight of a pint-size child genius (Madison Skye Validum) who has been accepted to Harvard but still believes in Santa. So much for “Veritas.”
‘Candy Cane Lane’
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
Reginald Hudlin’s vehicle for Eddie Murphy is the clear standout in the 2023 batch. Chris (Murphy) has a passion for Christmas and is obsessed with winning an annual contest that awards the best holiday decorations. He buys last-minute supplies at a pop-up Yuletide store run by Pepper (Jillian Bell), who turns out to be a nefarious elf. The major plot point involves Chris and his family trying to corral the gifts listed, ad nauseam, in “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” and which have come to calamitous life. As fun as this chase is, the film’s biggest asset is the chemistry between Murphy and his onscreen wife, Tracee Ellis Ross. Sign them up for a sequel, stat.

‘Dashing Through the Snow’
Stream it on Disney+.
Granted, the competition isn’t all that stiff this year, but Lil Rel Howery’s Santa easily emerges as the most fun of the season. On the streets of Los Angeles, Nick, as he goes by in Tim Story’s film, crosses paths with the Christmas hater Eddie (a nicely understated Chris Bridges, a.k.a. Ludacris). A social worker for the police, Eddie is on the outs with his wife (the underused Teyonah Parris) and looking after their daughter (Madison Skye Validum, making a twofer here) as a certain holiday rolls around. Thinking his jolly new acquaintance is deluded, Eddie tries to get him some professional help. Will Nick — who sweats glitter and whose flatulence smells like cinnamon — melt Eddie’s permafrosted heart? A nail-biting suspense this is not.
‘Elf Me’

As expected from something directed by a duo called Younuts, this Italian production is easily the oddest of the list — it starts off with a puppet Santa scaring off a young boy, Elia (Federico Ielapi), in the middle of the night with a big knife. The film’s elevator pitch is standard issue: the rogue elf Trip (Pasquale Petrolo), cast out of Santa’s workshop because he keeps inventing dangerous artifacts, helps Elia save the toy store run by his mother, Ivana (Anna Foglietta), from the evil forces of capitalism. It’s always fun to watch the holidays through a slightly different lens.
‘EXmas’
Stream it on Amazon Freevee.
The workaholic Graham (Robbie Amell) is stunned to discover that his family has secretly stayed in touch with his ex-girlfriend, Ali (Leighton Meester). They even invited her over for the holidays when they thought he wasn’t coming. Meester and Amell comfortably fire off dialogue that can be pleasingly snappy — “It’s the afterthought that counts,” Ali says upon discovering Graham’s last-minute presents — and the supporting cast rises to the occasion, especially Michael Hitchcock and Kathryn Greenwood as Graham’s milquetoast parents and Veronika Slowikowska as his droll lesbian sister (someone please give her a spinoff movie). Warning: Anybody with a basic knowledge of Minnesota in December will shudder at the sight of the wardrobe.
‘Family Switch’
Stream it on Netflix.

A fortune teller (Rita Moreno), a “planetary alignment”: The holiday connection is more background than integral to the plot in McG’s comedy of mixed-up identities. Regardless, it’s great fun to watch all the members of a family led by Jennifer Garner and Ed Helms be Freaky Friday’ed for Christmas. The best decision here was to let Garner and Helms do their thing — the two stars are more than game and their comic chops go a long way toward making “Family Switch” a seasonal must.
‘Genie’
Stream it on Peacock.
The fish-out-of-water trope has a pretty good holiday track record (see: “Elf”). Now comes Melissa McCarthy as Flora, a genie free again after thousands of years in a jewelry box. She is gung-ho on helping her hapless liberator, Bernard (Paapa Essiedu, looking not entirely comfortable), win back his estranged wife (Denée Benton) and daughter (Jordyn McIntosh). Bernard even has an unlimited number of wishes, because clearly genie-dom works like a Las Vegas buffet here. Unfortunately McCarthy does not have nearly enough opportunities to really let loose. This force of nature easily wrings laughs out of mild Tom Cruise jokes and the fabulousness of pizza, but we all know she can do so much more. Why keep her half-bottled?
‘The Naughty Nine’

It’s a thin line between troublemaker and sociopath, and the fairly scary fifth grader Andy (Winslow Fegley) comes dangerously close to crossing it. After he lands on Santa’s naughty list, Andy sets out for the North Pole to retrieve his undelivered presents, with the assistance of similarly deprived kids. Alberto Belli’s heist caper becomes more interesting when the children reach Santa’s village and the production design team gets down to lavish business. This being Disney, our antihero sees the error of his ways and undergoes a fast-tracked redemption. We’ll see if reformed Andy sticks around: The ending shamelessly sets up a sequel.
‘So Fly Christmas’
Stream it on BET+.
The most fun entry on the BET+ slate is Terri J. Vaughn’s comedy about friendship. When Wyvetta (Tichina Arnold, from “The Neighborhood”) is dumped at the altar on Christmas Eve, she and her supportive bestie Dione (Tami Roman) publicly swear off romance on their podcast. After close to a year of solidarity abstinence, Dione falls for Clarence (Robert Christopher Riley) — and tries to keep their relationship a secret to avoid hurting Wyvetta’s feelings. Um, did these two women really intend to remain chaste for the rest of their lives? Filmed largely in Atlantic City, this breezy movie benefits from Arnold and Roman’s believable camaraderie. And we could have used a lot more of Michael Colyar and Jackée Harry as Wyvetta’s forbearing parents. Make sure you stick around for the end credits, peppered with very funny outtakes."
2023-12-02,"Last year Charlene Truong Launer, a social media content creator, bought a real Christmas tree from a seller on a sidewalk in Manhattan.
Ms. Launer, 29, and her husband carried the tree 15 minutes to their apartment in TriBeCa and spent hours setting it up. “I was so excited,” she said.
The next morning, however, it all came crashing down — literally. “Our Christmas tree had toppled over, and all of our ornaments broke,” she said. “I was so devastated.”
They put it back together, but the tree headaches didn’t end there. “The whole time we had the tree the pine needles were all over the ground,” she said. Ms. Launer added that when it was time to toss the tree out, the collection team scattered pine needles everywhere after dragging the tree out of her apartment building.

She vowed never again.
Instead of shopping for a Christmas tree in person this year, she ordered a fake, nine-foot fir from Home Depot. “It arrived in a box, and I popped it open, and it was perfect,” she said. “It even came with lights.”
Ms. Launer considers herself a convert: “It looks really real,” she added. “I love it.”
She is hardly alone. According to polling by the American Christmas Tree Association, 77 percent of people who have at least one Christmas tree this year are going faux. The association found that people like how easy fake trees are to set up, that no maintenance is required, and that the trees look consistent and pretty throughout the holiday season.
Ben Frumin of Wirecutter, which is owned by The New York Times, said its guide to the best artificial Christmas trees was one of its most read product reviews last month — out of a catalog of more than 1,000 reviews.
But the popularity of faux trees isn’t necessarily great news for the environment: Bill Lindberg, a horticulture expert at Michigan State University, said there were environmental and economical benefits to having a real tree. “Artificial trees are made of plastic that will eventually end up in a landfill. Real trees are renewable resources and can be mulched up and returned to the ground,” he said.

But if you are going to opt for an artificial tree, he said the best thing you could do is use the same one over and over. “There was a study done that compared the environmental impacts of a real tree versus a fake tree,” he said. “It showed that if you kept your artificial tree for eight years, that is basically when you start to break even.” If you keep it for longer, he added, “you could be helping the environment.”
Other factors also drive fake trees’ popularity: Some people like how cost effective it is to buy one tree that can be reused for decades. “Our real Christmas tree that was six or seven feet was $300, which would be an expensive annual tradition,” Ms. Launer said. “Our fake one was $500, and then we get to put it in storage for next year.”
There’s also the fact that many fake trees now look remarkably real. Home Depot’s Grand Duchess, an artificial, 7.5-foot balsam fir that comes with 250 color-changing lights, became known as “the viral Christmas tree” on TikTok. The company said it was already sold out for the season.

Emily Scheiner, 36, who works in marketing, didn’t object when her boyfriend insisted on buying an artificial tree this year for their apartment in SoHo. “He is a neat freak, so the thought of falling needles around the apartment was freaking him out,” she said.
Ms. Scheiner, who is Jewish, didn’t grow up having a Christmas tree, so she was amazed by the many options for artificial ones. The couple settled on a 6.5-foot, artificial Douglas fir by the National Tree Company. She said her dog, Bernie, had embraced it, too. “We have to keep him from eating it.”

Even people who have been surrounded by real Christmas trees their whole lives are going faux this year.
Lillian Greene, 22, grew up on a Christmas tree farm in Boone, N.C. “Every year I would get to choose my own tree and cut it down,” she said.
But now she lives in Los Angeles, where she works as a youth counselor, the experience was different. “They have pre-cut ones at the grocery store, but I figured if I wasn’t getting the full Christmas farm experience, what was the point?”
She bought an artificial, six-foot tree from Amazon, which “felt a little like a family betrayal,” she said. “I already miss some things about having a real tree, like the smell.” She also noticed that the fake tree was a little “too perfect,” and added: “Real trees would have some dry spots where there aren’t any leaves.”
But she was enjoying the fact that there was no cleaning or maintenance. “I think as long as I live in L.A., I’ll stick to the fake one,” she said.
Her sister, Laurel Greene, 20, who still lives in North Carolina, even got one, too."

2023-12-04,"Spotify said on Monday that it would cut nearly a fifth of its work force, its third round of layoffs so far this year, as it has struggled to become consistently profitable after spending aggressively to expand beyond music streaming into areas such as podcasting.
Spotify’s chief executive, Daniel Ek, wrote in a note to employees posted on the company’s website that the platform now needed to “rightsize” to account for a “very different environment.” Spotify, which is based in Stockholm, will let go of about 1,500 people, or 17 percent of its staff.
“Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive,” Mr. Ek said. “Despite our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is still too big.”
Spotify’s cuts come as the technology industry reckons with the end of a decade of rock-bottom interest rates that propelled their growth, prompting the industry’s giants like Amazon, Meta and Salesforce to cut costs and shed jobs. Monday’s moves, Mr. Ek said, were about “preparing for our next phase, where being lean is not just an option but a necessity.”
Despite being the largest music streaming platform, Spotify has long struggled to be profitable because of the terms of licensing deals it has with record labels and music publishers. The company has pushed into new areas like podcasting, including buying the podcast studios Gimlet for $230 million in 2019 and The Ringer for about $200 million in 2020. It struck expensive deals with well-known figures such as former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, as well as Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan. More recently, the company has expanded into audiobooks.
The shifts have helped Spotify attract listeners and subscribers, but have not been a financial breakthrough. In the first nine months of 2023, Spotify lost $462 million, more than double the loss in the same period in 2022.

2023-12-05,"Spotify, the audio streaming platform, said on Tuesday that it would not renew its contracts for two critically acclaimed podcasts, “Heavyweight” and “Stolen,” the latest sign of the company curbing its podcasting ambitions as it struggles to become consistently profitable.
The shows, which are produced by Gimlet Media, the podcast studio Spotify acquired in 2019, will conclude their seasons and then have the option to shop their shows elsewhere.
“We are extremely proud of the teams who have supported these talented storytellers across each of the incredible episodes of ‘Heavyweight’ and ‘Stolen,’” a Spotify spokeswoman said, adding that the company will “work with the show creators to ensure a smooth transition for wherever these series go next.”
“Heavyweight” was hosted by Jonathan Goldstein and for seven seasons delved into the stories that shape people’s lives, seeking to help them create better endings. The show’s creators said on social media, “We’re so proud of everything we’ve made, and we’re hoping the show finds a new home in the future.”

“Stolen,” which received the Pulitzer Prize for audio reporting this year, was created by Connie Walker, a journalist who investigated her late father’s life and his experience and that of hundreds of other Indigenous children in Canada’s residential school system.
The decision came a day after Spotify announced that it would cut nearly a fifth of its work force, its third round of layoffs so far this year, as it seeks consistent profitability. The layoffs and reduction in podcast offerings comes as the technology industry contends with the end of a decade of low interest rates that fueled growth."
2023-12-06,"Though their attempts to keep up with developments in artificial intelligence have mostly fallen short, regulators around the world are taking vastly different approaches to policing the technology. The result is a highly fragmented and confusing global regulatory landscape for a borderless technology that promises to transform job markets, contribute to the spread of disinformation or even present a risk to humanity.
The major frameworks for regulating A.I. include:
Europe’s Risk-Based Law: The European Union’s A.I. Act, which is being negotiated on Wednesday, assigns regulations proportionate to the level of risk posed by an A.I. tool. The idea is to create a sliding scale of regulations aimed at putting the heaviest restrictions on the riskiest A.I. systems. The law would categorize A.I. tools based on four designations: unacceptable, high, limited and minimal risk.
Unacceptable risks include A.I. systems that perform social scoring of individuals or real-time facial recognition in public places. They would be banned. Other tools carrying less risk, such as software that generates manipulated videos and “deepfake” images must disclose that people are seeing A.I.-generated content. Violators could be fined 6 percent of their global sales. Minimally risky systems include spam filters and A.I.-generated video games.
U.S. Voluntary Codes of Conduct: The Biden administration has given companies leeway to voluntarily police themselves for safety and security risks. In July, the White House announced that several A.I. makers, including Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI, had agreed to self-regulate their systems.
The voluntary commitments included third-party security testing of tools, known as red-teaming, research on bias and privacy concerns, information-sharing about risks with governments and other organizations, and development of tools to fight societal challenges like climate change, while including transparency measures to identify A.I.-generated material. The companies were already performing many of those commitments.

U.S. Tech-Based Law: Any substantive regulation of A.I. will have to come from Congress. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, has promised a comprehensive bill for A.I., possibly by next year.
But so far, lawmakers have introduced bills that are focused on the production and deployment of A.I.-systems. The proposals include the creation of an agency like the Food and Drug Administration that could create regulations for A.I. providers, approve licenses for new systems, and establish standards. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, has supported the idea. Google, however, has proposed that the National Institute of Standards and Technology, founded more than a century ago with no regulatory powers, to serve as the hub of government oversight.
Other bills are focused on copyright violations by A.I. systems that gobble up intellectual property to create their systems. Proposals on election security and limiting the use of “deep fakes” have also been put forward.

China Moves Fast on Regulations of Speech: Since 2021, China has moved swiftly in rolling out regulations on recommendation algorithms, synthetic content like deep fakes, and generative A.I. The rules ban price discrimination by recommendation algorithms on social media, for instance. A.I. makers must label synthetic A.I.-generated content. And draft rules for generative A.I., like OpenAI’s chatbot, would require training data and the content the technology creates to be “true and accurate,” which many view as an attempt to censor what the systems say.
Global Cooperation: Many experts have said that effective A.I. regulation will need global collaboration. So far, such diplomatic efforts have produced few concrete results. One idea that has been floated is the creation of an international agency, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency that was created to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. A challenge will be overcoming the geopolitical distrust, economic competition and nationalistic impulses that have become so intertwined with the development of A.I."
2023-12-07,"About 700 Washington Post employees walked off the job for 24 hours on Thursday, protesting stalled union contract negotiations and expected layoffs.
The strike is the first walkout at The Post since the 1970s, union leaders said, and comes as the publication grapples with stagnant subscription numbers and low morale.
The union, the Post Guild, said that it had been negotiating a contract for 18 months but that The Post’s management had “refused to bargain in good faith” and had shut down negotiations over key issues. The union represents more than 1,000 employees, including journalists and some people on the company’s business side.
In a statement, a Post spokeswoman said the company respected the right of its union members to go on strike.

“We will make sure our readers and customers are as unaffected as possible,” the spokeswoman said. “The Post’s goal remains the same as it has from the start of our negotiations: to reach an agreement with the Guild that meets the needs of our employees and the needs of our business.”
The Post, owned by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has struggled in the post-Trump era to gain paying online readers. Subscriptions dropped to about 2.5 million this year from a peak of three million in 2020. Earlier this year, The Post was on pace to lose $100 million in 2023, according to people with knowledge of the company’s finances.
In October, The Post’s interim chief executive, Patty Stonesifer, announced that the company would cut 240 jobs from its 2,600-person work force. She replaced Fred Ryan, who stepped down as chief executive in June.
The 240 jobs were initially expected to come through voluntary buyouts, but Ms. Stonesifer told workers last month that layoffs might be needed to reach that number.

Sarah Kaplan, a climate reporter and chief steward of the Post Guild, said in an interview that one sticking point over the new contract was wages. The Post has proposed a 2.25 percent increase, which Ms. Kaplan said amounted to “a pay cut” when taking inflation into account.
“We see all of the ways that The Post as an institution is being weakened by mismanagement on the part of the company’s leaders with these buyouts and the insufficient contract proposal,” Ms. Kaplan said.
“What is driving a lot of us to participate in this is a feeling that we want to have a say in the future of The Washington Post because we care about this place, and we think it can be better,” she added.
The union asked readers not to engage with any Post content in print or online on Thursday, saying in a letter that “taking this historic action is not a decision we came to lightly.”

Sadly, the world appears poised for more shakes than gentle rattles in 2024. The year 2023 was marked by rising tensions and geopolitical shifts: In April, India overtook China as the world’s most populous country; in May, July and September, the entertainment and automotive industries in the United States were upended by labor strikes; the first week of July was declared the planet’s hottest week on record, and there were record-breaking wildfires in Canada, a historic drought in Brazil’s Amazon jungle, and winds from Hurricane Dora caused the deadliest fires in the United States in more than a century in Maui. In July and August, coup d’états in Niger and Gabon made for a total of 10 attempted coups in Africa’s “coup belt” since 2020; in August, Japan proposed a record $52 billion increase to its military spending amid tensions with China; in September, NATO hopeful Sweden boosted its defense budget to about $11 billion, with the defense minister Pal Jonson citing “the most serious security policy situation since the end of the Second World War;” and in October, Hamas launched the deadliest civilian massacre in Israeli history in a surprise attack out of Gaza.
Looming in the wings is 2024, a live-wire year for democracy: America enters possibly one of the most critical presidential election periods in modern history, while Russian President Vladimir V. Putin will likely walk, not run, to his fifth term in his country’s presidential elections. Then there is Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelensky may be up for re-election on March 31 after his first term in office ends, unless martial law remains in effect, delaying the vote.
In 2024, we will experience a wide range of events — from world-shaking elections to global commemorations — many of which will serve as reminders of the importance of connection and community in these trying times. Read on to learn more.

THE CARIBBEAN, Dec. 6: In 2017, celebrities including Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid promoted the Fyre Festival, which was billed as a glamorous and luxurious destination music festival. The actual event turned out to be a fiasco, as attendees were stranded on a deserted island in the Bahamas, lacking water and served cheese sandwiches in foam containers (which is the opposite of #goals on Instagram).

Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, built nearly 2,300 feet below ground, will be used to measure neutrinos in order to predict when a star is about to explode. This will give astronomers time to prepare their telescopes, while also helping efforts to piece together a fuller picture of the universe."
2023-12-09,"I’m delighted to invite university students to apply for my 2024 win-a-trip contest. I’ve been holding these contests since 2006, and taking the winners along with me on a reporting trip to cover global poverty and social justice issues. My aim is to get more people writing about these neglected topics and to generate more interest in them.
The winner may write for The New York Times. HBO made a documentary called “Reporter” based on my 2007 win-a-trip journey to Congo with the winners Leana Wen and Will Okun; it’s available to stream on Amazon and iTunes if you want to see what you’re getting yourself in for. The contest opens now and the entry deadline is 11:59 p.m. E.T. on Jan. 7, 2024.
The contest is open to students enrolled in an American two- or four-year college or university, either as an undergraduate or at the graduate level. Please use the form below to submit an essay of up to 700 words explaining why we should pick you to win the trip. Tell us about yourself and what you would bring to the reporting and to readers. If you’d like, you may also suggest where we should go and what you would like to write about for The Times, and/or discuss your aspirations and what you would like to be doing in 10 years. Our goal is to get a better understanding of you, your accomplishments and your writing ability. Read the full rules below.
What are we looking for? Someone very smart, with excellent communication skills, so that your writing and posts on social media will elevate these issues. If you blog or have other writing, photography or video experience, be sure to mention it and include links; you’re also welcome to include a short bio to give us more of a sense of your interests and accomplishments.
My plan is to travel for a week or two with the winner, perhaps in the late spring or early summer. I’ll try to work around the winner’s schedule. Your expenses will be covered, but there’s no cash award. I’m not sure just where we’ll travel, and I’m not even sure that it’ll be abroad. Possibilities include Zimbabwe or Congo, Native American reservations, Suriname or Papua New Guinea, or perhaps somewhere else entirely.
Also, remember that traveling is sometimes tough. The joke within The New York Times is that first prize is a trip with me; second prize is two trips with me. We may be bouncing over awful roads, eating wretched food, and you may get sick. “Hotel” rooms may come with bugs and rats. And we’ll be on the go from dawn to dusk. To get a sense of what the past winners have done, check out Tyler Pager’s blog posts from the Central African Republic in 2018, Aneri Pattani’s posts from Liberia in 2017, Austin Meyer’s post on malnutrition in India in 2015, Saumya Dave’s first impressions of Morocco in 2011 and Paul Bowers’s reflections in 2009 on how religion in Liberia shares many similarities with the South.

2023-12-10,"The media mogul Shari Redstone is in talks to sell a controlling stake in National Amusements, the parent company of the sprawling news and entertainment empire that includes the Paramount movie studio, CBS and MTV, according to three people familiar with the talks.
In recent weeks, National Amusements has held talks with Skydance, the media and entertainment company founded by David Ellison, who is the son of the billionaire founder of Oracle, Larry Ellison. It’s unclear whether a deal will be reached, and the value the talks place on Ms. Redstone’s stake couldn’t be determined.
A deal for Paramount, if it came to fruition, could be a starting gun for a far-reaching reordering of the media industry over the next year. Comcast, the TV and cable giant that owns NBCUniversal, is on the prowl for deals. Warner Bros. Discovery, the owner of HBO and CNN, in effect, comes on the market next year because of arcane tax reasons.
Ms. Redstone, 69, who waged a bitter battle with her onetime allies to retain control of the company, now appears to be seriously considering relinquishing it. She has held out for years amid broader headwinds facing the traditional media industry, but is exploring her options now that a serious suitor has expressed interest, two of the people said. Ms. Redstone’s holdings are facing some economic pressures, including long-term debt obligations and the unreliable advertising market for media companies like Paramount.

Puck earlier reported that Ms. Redstone and Skydance were in talks. Spokespeople for National Amusements, Ms. Redstone and Skydance declined to comment.
A deal for Ms. Redstone’s stake in National Amusements would represent a major changing of the guard in the media business. Paramount has been in the Redstone family for decades, since Ms. Redstone’s father, the bellicose deal maker Sumner Redstone, won the company in a hard-fought bidding war that drew heavyweights including the billionaire Barry Diller.
Paramount, with its bundle of cable channels, a movie studio and its CBS broadcast network, has long been considered an acquisition target. Ms. Redstone began holding conversations about a deal earlier this year with parties including technology firms like Amazon, Apple and Netflix, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The feverish deal making that seems poised to sweep the industry has partly been set off by the slow decline of television. For years, TV companies like Paramount were buoyed by ever-rising payments from cable distributors. But in recent years, the business model of cable TV has begun to collapse as consumers have dropped their cable subscriptions and shifted to streaming services like Netflix, leaving traditional television programmers looking for an exit.
Even streaming, once thought to be a savior of the media business, has begun to show signs of strain. Old-school TV companies like Paramount, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery are pouring billions of dollars into building up streaming services in an attempt to catch Netflix, but none have so far managed to replicate the profits of cable TV.

Ms. Redstone is being advised by BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank founded by Byron Trott, a former Goldman Sachs partner who consults with some of America’s wealthiest and best-connected family business owners. Earlier this year, BDT & MSD Partners said it was taking a $125 million stake in National Amusements that would help the parent company pay down its loan obligations.
Ms. Redstone owns a controlling stake in National Amusements. In a February filing, Paramount said that National Amusements directly or indirectly owned about 77.4 percent of Paramount’s voting class A common stock.
Founded in 2010 by David Ellison, Skydance has emerged as one of the leading independent studios in Hollywood. It has a longstanding relationship with Paramount, producing hits like “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning.”
Skydance is backed by RedBird Capital Partners, a private equity firm that is among the most active in the media industry. RedBird is also backing RedBird IMI, the venture led by the former CNN chief Jeff Zucker that is pursuing a deal for the British news outlets The Telegraph and The Spectator.
Relinquishing Paramount would be a momentous step for Ms. Redstone, who fought to hold onto her family’s control as her father’s mental capacity began to decline. In 2018, CBS — led at the time by Les Moonves — sued Ms. Redstone to strip her control of her media holdings, but Ms. Redstone ultimately prevailed. Mr. Moonves, who faced a series of sexual harassment allegations, was ousted from CBS in 2018. He has denied allegations of nonconsensual sexual relations.
Though the value of Paramount has declined steadily in recent years — matching the broader fortunes of traditional media — investor speculation about a deal for National Amusements caused shares in the company to spike this month. Though its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, continues to lose money, Paramount said earlier this year that it had narrowed its losses for the service while continuing to add subscribers.

A disastrous performance in Congressional testimony sealed the fate of the University of Pennsylvania’s president and raised questions about the heads of Harvard and M.I.T.

Rethinking university leadership
After weeks of criticism from alumni, donors and public officials — and disastrous testimony on Capitol Hill — Liz Magill stepped down as the University of Pennsylvania’s president on Saturday over her stance on combating antisemitism. Meanwhile, the heads of Harvard and M.I.T. remain under pressure, with some of their fiercest critics continuing to call for them to resign, too.
That has ignited a broader debate about how American universities are run, and raised a question: Should these institutions look outside of academia for their top leadership?
A recap: Magill resigned — followed shortly by Scott Bok, the chairman of Penn’s board of trustees — days after she gave evasive, legalistic answers to lawmakers on whether students advocating the genocide of Jews should be disciplined. Claudine Gay, the president of Harvard, faces similar pressure from alumni including the financier Bill Ackman, though she has also won support from faculty; the Harvard Corporation, a governing board that could oust her, is set to meet on Monday.
Modern universities may require different kinds of leadership. Traditionally, university presidents have been either academics or veteran school administrators: 83 percent of those leaders have had a doctorate, while just 1.4 percent had a master’s in business administration, according to the American Council for Education.
But colleges and universities are now multibillion-dollar enterprises, with Harvard’s endowment standing at $50 billion and Penn’s at $21 billion. Their presidents report to boards that are often stocked with prominent business executives, and they must frequently raise money from corporate leaders. They’re also increasingly expected to deftly navigate a politically charged environment.

Some institutions have done well with presidents from outside academia. Barry Mills (who in fairness holds a doctorate in biology) jumped from being a partner at the white-shoe law firm Debevoise & Plimpton to serving as a highly regarded president of Bowdoin College for 14 years.
Politicians have also won acclaim in the role. Examples include Mitch Daniels, the former Republican governor of Indiana who froze tuition fees for seven straight years as president of Purdue University, and John Brademas, a Democratic lawmaker from Indiana who helped transform N.Y.U. into a global powerhouse.
But such a move may draw a backlash, especially from longtime professors who place a high value on an independent academia. (Coming from business doesn’t guarantee success either: Simon Newman, a former financier, resigned as president of a Maryland college after reportedly comparing struggling freshmen to bunnies that should be drowned or shot.)
Charlie Eaton, the author of “Bankers in the Ivory Tower,” said that leaders with an academic background could protect schools from outside pressure. “There’s already so much pull towards doing what donors would want the university to do,” he told DealBook. “You need presidents who are academics to keep the university anchored in that project.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Saudi Arabia is blocking efforts to limit fossil fuel use. The kingdom is pushing back against talks at the COP28 climate summit to call for phasing out hydrocarbons to halt global warming, The Times reports. Previous climate deals have shied from mentioning fossil fuels, but dynamics have shifted this year, which has been the hottest in recorded history.
Cigna pulls out of merger talks with Humana. The insurer abandoned efforts to create a $140 billion giant after shareholders reportedly reacted coolly to the proposed deal and the two sides failed to agree on a price. Cigna will instead focus on smaller acquisitions and stock buybacks.
Tucker Carlson is said to be starting his own streaming service. The former Fox News host will launch the Tucker Carlson Network with content including interviews, short-form videos and monologues, according to The Wall Street Journal. He’ll continue to post free content on X, where he began broadcasting in the spring. Separately, Elon Musk said that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones would be allowed to return to X, five years after he was banned from the platform.
Donald Trump abruptly reverses course on testifying at his Manhattan civil fraud trial. The former president announced on Truth Social on Sunday that he wouldn’t return to the witness stand on Monday. Trump had been expected to continue defending himself against accusations that he had fraudulently inflated his net worth.

A Paramount sale may just be the start
Shari Redstone, the mogul who runs the parent company of Paramount Global, is finally considering a deal for her ailing media empire as she holds talks to sell control to the entertainment company Skydance. (Shares in Paramount are up 12 percent since Puck first reported the talks last week.)
But the bigger question isn’t just whether Redstone will sell or at what valuation. It’s what sort of deals would come after such a sale, as the media industry braces itself for a flurry of transformative M.&A., DealBook’s Michael de la Merced writes.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Redstone has been under pressure to do a deal for some time. National Amusements, which her family has run for decades, has already negotiated with creditors over its hefty debt load and taken an investment from BDT & MSD Partners with an eye toward a sale of some kind. (BDT & MSD is advising Redstone now.)
The fundamental problem is that Paramount, which runs its namesake studio and TV networks like CBS and MTV, is considered too small to succeed. Though it has valuable properties like the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, it has far less money and content to compete in the loss-making streaming wars against the likes of Netflix, Disney and Comcast’s NBCUniversal.
Skydance may be interested only in parts of Paramount Global, primarily its fabled Hollywood studio. Skydance, which is backed by the media investment firm RedBird Capital Partners, is already a partner with Paramount on the “Mission: Impossible” movies.
That raises questions about who might buy the television networks, which have been hit by slumping ad sales and “cord cutting” by viewers, but still generate significant fees from cable providers who carry those channels. Private equity firms happy to milk those declining revenues, perhaps including RedBird, might be the answer.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
More consolidation is coming — but who will buy? Even a bulked-up Skydance-Paramount wouldn’t have the scale of a Netflix or a Disney, suggesting that it might need to be sold again.
But U.S. antitrust regulators remain wary of consolidation, potentially limiting the ability of, say, Comcast to buy another major studio. (That would most likely also extend to tech giants like Apple or Amazon.) Perhaps a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery could work, though that company also faces a huge debt load, and such a deal might still face tough scrutiny in Washington.
All of which is to say that even if Redstone sells, her buyer would face many of the same headaches.
The pro-A.I. philosophy on the rise
A philosophical divide within the artificial intelligence sector burst into the open last month after Sam Altman’s brief ouster from OpenAI. While the board members who fired him believe that the technology could lead to humanity’s doom, encapsulated by a school of thought known as Effective Altruism, another is increasingly coming to the fore.
Effective Accelerationism — or “e/acc” to adherents — posits that A.I. should advance as quickly as possible, without guardrails that might limit its progress. Kevin Roose, The Times’s tech columnist, explores its rise (and why some in Washington are worried about it):
The battle between the e/accs and the Effective Altruists is one of many quasi-religious schisms breaking out in San Francisco’s A.I. scene these days, as insiders argue about how quickly the technology is progressing, and what should be done about it.
E/acc prefers the all-gas, no-brakes approach. Its adherents favor open-sourcing A.I. software rather than having it be controlled by big corporations, and unlike Effective Altruists, they don’t see powerful A.I. as something to be feared or guarded against. They believe that A.I.’s benefits far outweigh its harms, and that the right thing to do with such important technology is to get out of the way and let it rip.
Some of those tenets have been embraced by Silicon Valley luminaries like the investors Marc Andreessen and Gerry Tan and by the seven-month-old Mistral, a French start-up that just raised $415 million at a $2 billion valuation.

2023-12-14,"ACROSTIC — Today’s passage sounds so modern to me that I was surprised to learn that its source dates all the way back to 2005, which is almost before Amazon Prime existed — if you were just about to say, “Hey, Caitlin, 2005 wasn’t really so long ago.” The constructors David Balton and Jane Stewart drew from “Talk to the Hand,” a book by Lynne Truss, a prodigious writer, journalist and noted stickler of language. (You may remember her earlier book “Eats, Shoots and Leaves,” which was a major best seller that I really enjoyed, not that I remember exactly where to put my commas, all the time, sadly.)
“Talk to the Hand” seems a bit like “Eats, Shoots and Leaves” except that the author takes issue with actual people, rather than just words and punctuation, and Truss — whose subtitle for “Talk to the Hand” is “The Utter Bloody Rudeness of Everyday Life (or Six Good Reasons to Stay Home and Bolt the Door) — has about had it with the lot of us. In particular, the excerpt laments our digital lives, as we bury our faces in screens to interact with one another, losing real-life social skills.
The puzzle’s clue set is stuffed with cleverly presented terms relating to that electronic universe. “Item not free of charge, ideally,” sounded like an atomic reference to me — an electron or some such — but it’s a LAPTOP. (What’s more frustrating than a dead laptop, and nowhere to plug it in?) An “Identifier more often typed than uttered” is a USERNAME; “Genetically predisposed” is HARD-WIRED. I struggled slightly with both of these clues, but was amused by their answers. A “Modern subject of parental limit on kids” is more specific, but also fun: It’s SCREENTIME, which made me think of my own predigital childhood when I was allowed to watch one half-hour program on a blocky tube television after school, or two, if one was “educational.” A “Creative use of punctuation?” is an EMOTICON, and a “Horizontal menu” is a TOOLBAR.
There are still more examples, most of them straightforwardly clued. I noted one trivia question that goes back to the old days before flat screen TVs and that solves to a double meaning. The “1976 movie with the line ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore!’” solves to NETWORK, something that serves to connect us — except that nowadays, we’re more likely to actually interact in person when our NETWORK is down (or, as another clue says: “Out of operation for now,” or OFFLINE).

Constructor Notes
In today’s plugged-in world, spiral notebooks exist alongside digital notebooks, and solvers might tackle old-fashioned word puzzles with pencil and paper, or online. Lynne Truss’s quote gave us a chance to play with contemporary terms like “username” and “screen time,” as well as traditional words, such as “navigation” and “menu,” that have acquired fresh meanings.
We have made a practice of using quotes only from works written in English, but the Brits sometimes use their own orthography. We hope “behaviour” didn’t give anyone fits.

2023-12-16,"You’re reading the David Wallace-Wells newsletter, for Times subscribers only.  The best-selling science writer and essayist explores climate change, technology, the future of the planet and how we live on it.
Try it for 4 weeks.
It only took 28 years. When Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber banged his gavel on the resolution text of COP28 in Dubai on Wednesday, it marked what has been widely called a historic achievement: the first time nearly every country on Earth agreed that oil and gas play a role in driving global warming, and the first time they nodded toward the need for a fossil fuel drawdown.
For a historic text, the language was quite mealy-mouthed, since the resolution only “calls on” nations to “contribute” to “transitioning away” from fossil fuels — and only in the energy sector. Harder-line climate advocates had been pushing for a language of “phase out,” which might have helped tug the world a little bit more quickly to a postcarbon future. Instead, what they got was much more like an endorsement of the status quo, reflecting the ongoing state of play rather than accelerating it, because such a transition is already well underway.
Global sales of internal-combustion engine vehicles peaked in 2017. Investment in renewable energy has exceeded investment in fossil fuel infrastructure for several years running now. In 2022, 83 percent of new global energy capacity was green. The question isn’t about whether there will be a transition, but how fast, global and thorough it will be.
The answer is: not fast or global or thorough enough yet, at least on the current trajectories, which COP28 effectively affirmed. To limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius now requires entirely eliminating emissions not long after 2040, according to the Global Carbon Project, whose “carbon budget” for 1.5 degrees Celsius will be exhausted in about five years of current levels of emissions. For 1.7 degrees Celsius, it’s just after 2050, and for 2 degrees Celsius, 2080. And despite Al Jaber’s claim that COP28 has kept the 1.5 degree goal alive, hardly anyone believes it’s still plausible.
Instead, most analysts predict a global peak in fossil fuel emissions at some point over the next decade, followed not by a decline but a long plateau — meaning that, every year for the foreseeable future, we would be doing roughly as much damage to the future of the planet’s climate as was done in recent years. The expected result: end-of-century warming between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius.

Climate change around the world: In “Postcards From a World on Fire,” 193 stories from individual countries show how climate change is reshaping reality everywhere, from dying coral reefs in Fiji to disappearing oases in Morocco and far, far beyond.
The role of our leaders: Writing at the end of 2020, Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, found reasons for optimism in the Biden presidency, a feeling perhaps borne out by the passing of major climate legislation. That doesn’t mean there haven’t been criticisms. For example, Charles Harvey and Kurt House argue that subsidies for climate capture technology will ultimately be a waste.
The worst climate risks, mapped: In this feature, select a country, and we'll break down the climate hazards it faces. In the case of America, our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths.
What people can do: Justin Gillis and Hal Harvey describe the types of local activism that might be needed, while Saul Griffith points to how Australia shows the way on rooftop solar. Meanwhile, small changes at the office might be one good way to cut significant emissions, writes Carlos Gamarra.
Not very long ago, this was a future that terrified us — the world beyond the goals of the Paris agreement looking tremendously bleak. Now, we are not just coming to accept that future but, in some corners, applauding it as progress.

2023-12-18,"Parler, the social media platform popular with right-wing audiences that was removed from app stores after hosting calls for violence around Jan. 6, 2021, will relaunch early next year, the company’s new owners announced on Monday.
“We’re committed to bringing Parler back online,” Ryan Rhodes, Parler’s new chief executive, said in a statement. The app had been shut down in April after it was purchased by Starboard, a digital media company.
Mr. Rhodes and Elise Pierotti, who was previously the company’s chief marketing officer purchased the company last week, Ms. Pierotti said.
Parler, which had billed itself as a platform for “uncancelable free speech,” used to draw millions of supporters of former President Donald J. Trump and was once the most downloaded app on Apple’s App Store. But tech companies pulled their support for the platform soon after the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol, saying that the company did not do enough to police posts that incited violence or crime.

Apple and Google banned the app from their app stores, and Amazon booted the company from its web-hosting service. Effectively banned from app stores on virtually all of the world’s smartphones, the platform then struggled to maintain its user base. It was later reinstated in both the Apple and Google app stores.
Now, the app is positioned to return as Mr. Trump seeks the presidency for a third time. The relaunch is scheduled for February.
Mr. Rhodes said that Parler’s new management would take measures to keep “harmful content like terrorism, child porn and trafficking off our platform.”
Mr. Rhodes added that the platform’s newest iteration would not aim to compete with Truth Social, the conservative social media company started by Mr. Trump. That site has dominated the conservative social media space in Parler’s absence, crowding out rival platforms like Gab, Gettr, MeWe and Minds.
Parler said in a statement that it would emphasize “a return to its roots as a robust marketplace of ideas.”

The embattled social media platform had made headlines last year when a deal for Kanye West, the rapper criticized over his antisemitic remarks, to buy it unraveled soon after it was announced.
On Monday, Ms. Pierotti listed a third partner, Jaco Booyens, as a co-owner of Parler’s newest iteration. After this article initially published, Ms. Pierotti said she misspoke and said that Mr. Booyens is “just on the team as the Chief Strategy Officer.”

2023-12-19,"There’s big news this week for tiny warriors.
Games Workshop, the company behind Warhammer 40,000, the wildly popular tabletop game with miniature figurines, announced on Monday that it had reached a deal with Amazon Studios to bring the game to life on television and film screens.
The actor Henry Cavill, known for his roles in the “Superman” franchise and as the title character on Netflix’s fantasy series “The Witcher,” is set to appear on the show and be its executive producer.
The two companies had signed an agreement last year to create television programs and movies based on the Warhammer franchise, and will now move forward bringing the game’s universe to life.
“All we can tell you right now is that an elite band of screenwriters, each with their own particular passion for Warhammer, is being assembled,” Games Workshop said in a statement on their website.

Warhammer 40,000 was released in 1987, and in the decades since has enchanted players as they take command of small but mighty warriors for “supremacy in the grim darkness of the far future,” according to the game’s core rule book.
Two or more players place their hand-painted plastic models onto terrain set in the 41st millennium — the rule book recommends a dining table or a floor — and send them into battle among aliens and supernatural creatures.

The game has developed a significant fan base and detailed lore throughout the years, becoming Games Workshop’s most popular product. Hundreds of novels have expanded on the Warhammer universe and mythology. It also has video game spinoffs.
Much of the passion for the game, though, comes before the battle begins. Games Workshop doesn’t sell ready-to-play models for Warhammer 40,000. Instead, players purchase parts to construct, and paint in details themselves for a personal touch.

Cavill is himself a fan of the game.
In 2021, the actor, who has been known to construct his own personal computers, discussed his Warhammer hobby on “The Graham Norton Show.”
“You have to paint them,” Cavill said. “There’s the painting-modeling side of the hobby, and then there’s the gaming side of the hobby.”
The game found a new legion of fans during the pandemic, including other actors and musicians ready to battle Cavill in the fictional dystopia.
Studios have been taking notice of the trend, and capitalizing on growing interest with shows like the HBO Max series “The Last of Us,” which raked in bigger audiences than some of the network’s flagship shows.
Amazon Studios has bet on fantasy franchises already, with “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” a prequel to the J.R.R. Tolkien novels. In 2021, the studio released “The Wheel of Time,” based on the book series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.
No details were given about anticipated release dates or the types of projects planned for the Warhammer franchise. Games Workshop said that it could be some time before the tiny warriors stand tall on a movie screen.

2023-12-20,"The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday proposed sweeping changes to bolster the key federal rule that has protected children’s privacy online, in one of the most significant attempts by the U.S. government to strengthen consumer privacy in more than a decade.
The changes are intended to fortify the rules underlying the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, a law that restricts the online tracking of youngsters by services like social media apps, video game platforms, toy retailers and digital advertising networks. Regulators said the moves would “shift the burden” of online safety from parents to apps and other digital services while curbing how platforms may use and monetize children’s data.
The proposed changes would require certain online services to turn off targeted advertising by default for children under 13. They would prohibit the online services from using personal details like a child’s cellphone number to induce youngsters to stay on their platforms longer. That means online services would no longer be able to use personal data to bombard young children with push notifications.
The proposed updates would also strengthen security requirements for online services that collect children’s data as well as limit the length of time online services could keep that information. And they would limit the collection of student data by learning apps and other educational-tech providers, by allowing schools to consent to the collection of children’s personal details only for educational purposes, not commercial purposes.
“Kids must be able to play and learn online without being endlessly tracked by companies looking to hoard and monetize their personal data,” Lina M. Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement on Wednesday. She added, “By requiring firms to better safeguard kids’ data, our proposal places affirmative obligations on service providers and prohibits them from outsourcing their responsibilities to parents.”

COPPA is the central federal law protecting children online in the United States, though members of Congress have tried to introduce more expansive online safety bills for children and teenagers since then.
Under the COPPA law, online services aimed at children, or those that know they have children on their platform, must obtain a parent’s permission before collecting, using or sharing personal details — such as first and last names, addresses and phone numbers — from a child under the age of 13.
To comply with the law, popular apps like Instagram and TikTok have terms of service that prohibit children under 13 from setting up accounts. Social media and video game apps typically ask new users to provide their birth dates.

Still, regulators have filed numerous complaints against large tech companies accusing them of failing to set up effective age-gating systems; showing targeted ads to children based on their online behavior without parental permission; enabling strangers to contact children online; or keeping children’s data even after parents asked for it to be deleted. Amazon; Microsoft; Google and its YouTube platform; Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite; and Musical.ly, the social app now known as TikTok, have all paid multimillion-dollar fines to settle charges that they violated the law.
Separately, a coalition of 33 state attorneys general filed a joint federal lawsuit in October against Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, saying the company had violated the children’s privacy law. In particular, the states criticized Meta’s age-checking system, saying the company had allowed millions of underage users to create accounts without parental consent. Meta has said that it spent a decade working to make online experiences safe and age-appropriate for teenagers and that the states’ complaint “mischaracterizes” the company’s work.
The F.T.C. proposed the stronger children’s privacy protections amid heightened public concern over the potential mental health and physical safety risks that popular online services may pose to young people online. Parents, pediatricians and children’s groups warn that social media content recommendation systems have routinely shown inappropriate content promoting self-harm, eating disorders and plastic surgery to young girls. And some school officials worry that social media platforms distract students from their work in class.
States this year have passed more than a dozen laws that restrict minors’ access to social media networks or pornography sites. Industry trade groups have successfully sued to temporarily block several of those laws.
The F.T.C. began reviewing the children’s privacy rule in 2019, receiving more than 175,000 comments from tech and advertising industry trade groups, video content developers, consumer advocacy groups and members of Congress. The resulting proposal runs more than 150 pages.

Proposed changes include narrowing an exception that allows online services to collect persistent identification codes for children for certain internal operations, like product improvement, consumer personalization or fraud prevention, without parental consent.
The proposed changes would prohibit online operators from employing such user-tracking codes to maximize the amount of time children spend on their platforms. That means online services would not be able to use techniques like sending mobile phone notifications “to prompt the child to engage with the site or service, without verifiable parental consent,” according to the proposal.
How online services would comply with the changes is not yet known. Members of the public have 60 days to comment on the proposals, after which the commission will vote.
The initial reactions by industry trade groups were mixed.
The Software and Information Industry Association, whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, said that it was “grateful” for the F.T.C.’s efforts to consider outside input and that the agency’s proposal had cited the group’s recommendations.
“We are interested in participating in the next phase of the effort and hopeful the F.T.C. will take a similarly thoughtful approach,” Paul Lekas, the group’s head of global public policy, said in an email.

NetChoice, whose members include TikTok, Snap, Amazon, Google and Meta, by contrast, said the agency’s proposed changes went too far by setting defaults that parents might not want. The group has sued several states to block new laws that would limit access to online services by minors.
“With this new rule, the F.T.C. is overriding the wishes of parents,” Carl Szabo, the group’s general counsel, said in a statement. It “will make it even harder for websites to provide necessary services to children as approved by their parents.”"
2023-12-21,"It was supposed to be what a fan described as a “loving homage” to his hero, the author J.R.R. Tolkien, and to “The Lord of the Rings,” which he called “one of the most defining experiences of his life.”
A judge in California had another view.
The fan, Demetrious Polychron of Santa Monica, Calif., violated copyright protections this year when he wrote and published a sequel to the epic “Rings” series, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson of the Central District of California ruled last week.
In a summary judgment, Judge Wilson found “direct evidence of copying” and barred Polychron from further distributing the book or any others in a planned series. He also ordered Polychron to destroy all electronic and physical copies of the published work, “The Fellowship of the King,” by Sunday. As of Wednesday, Amazon and Barnes & Noble were no longer listing the book for sale online.
The saga began in 2017, when Polychron emailed and then hand-delivered a gift-wrapped copy of his book to Simon Tolkien, a grandson of the author, at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. Accompanying the gift was a letter in which Polychron said that he had written “the obvious pitch-perfect sequel” to Tolkien’s fantastical trilogy about Middle-earth and that he “really didn’t have a choice,” according to court documents. He said his goal was “to stick as close to canon as I could.”

Polychron repeatedly tried to share his manuscript with the Tolkien estate, which declined to grant the rights to a third-party publication and noted its policy to not license other writers to create sequels or extensions of work by Tolkien, who died in 1973. Still, Polychron went ahead and self-published his book.
The Tolkien estate learned that the book had been published in March 2023, when it was being sold through Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The estate said in court documents that it sent Polychron a cease-and-desist letter, and tried to reach him several times by phone, to no avail.
In April, Polychron sued the Tolkien estate and Amazon. He claimed that “Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power,” an Amazon Prime Video prequel series that was released last year and is one of the few adaptations authorized by the Tolkien estate, infringed on the copyright of his book. He asked for $250 million in compensation.
Polychron said in court documents that he was inspired by Tolkien and the original “Rings” series, but he argued that he created a “wholly original book and concept” for the sequel, including “separate characters and story lines that compose as much as one-half of the 8-episode series” released by Amazon.
That case was dismissed in August, with Judge Wilson finding that Polychron’s book was infringing on the Tolkien estate’s copyright.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Tolkien estate filed a lawsuit against Polychron in June, seeking an injunction to prevent the further distribution of his work, and accusing him of “willful and blatant” copyright violation in creating and profiting from derivative works.
The book included major characters from “Lord of the Rings,” including Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn and Sauron, according to court documents, as well as verbatim copying of at least 15 poems or passages from the trilogy; the use of Middle-earth and dozens of other settings from the original books, described in detail; and the duplication of a central plot and structure, among other copied elements. Court documents also said Polychron had conceived an entire seven-book series, “The War of the Rings.”
Judge Wilson wrote that Polychron’s lawsuit was “frivolous,” and ordered him to pay the Tolkien estate and Amazon $134,000 in lawyer’s fees.
Neither Polychron nor his lawyer could be reached for comment. A lawyer for the Tolkien estate, Steven Maier, said in a statement that the injunction was “an important success” for protecting Tolkien’s work.
“This case involved a serious infringement of The Lord of the Rings copyright, undertaken on a commercial basis,” he said. “The estate hopes that the award of a permanent injunction and attorneys’ fees will be sufficient to dissuade others who may have similar intentions.”"

I almost can’t believe it, but 2023 is nearly over.
This is our last newsletter of the year, so I wanted to thank you for starting your morning with our coverage of our favorite state.
It has been a delight to be able to travel across California and learn about its strange history and fascinating people, and to share those tales with you. Many of the most memorable moments of my year were while reporting for this newsletter: meeting the world’s oldest aquarium fish, eating my way through San Francisco’s Burmese restaurants, visiting migrant camps at the Tijuana border, seeing an ancient lake come back to life in the Central Valley and learning everything possible about our transfixing state flower. It’s an honor to do this work.
Today, I’ll be sharing some of what you told me about the best part of your year. Hearing from readers, especially about the details and small pleasures of your lives, is one of the best parts of my job. I hope you enjoy reading these notes as much as I did.

“One of my greatest joys this past year has been getting into stand-up paddle boarding, often taking my inflatable board down to Donner Lake, a short, five-minute drive from my home, to start my mornings. What a delight it’s been to go out for a spin on magical, glass-like water.” — Kelly Bathgate, Truckee
“My husband and I were invited to rendezvous with a friend in Los Angeles over the July 4 holiday. We booked a rental home in Venice and promptly joined the locals as they celebrated among the famed canals. I never knew about the famed Venice Rubber Ducky Race in which hundreds of tiny, yellow floaty ducks are dropped from a bridge. This is not a fast race; it is mind-boggling in its swirling slowness as the duckies ebb and flow down the canal. Interference by genuine amphibious birds made it more thrilling. The true joy was with the people, though. This was honestly the most wholesome, laugh-out-loud family goodness I have experienced in years. Made me proud to celebrate being an American.” — Lynka Adams, Napa

“Happiness has been found in my own backyard. I sit on my small patio atop Potrero Hill and enjoy the lovely, mostly succulent garden that my boyfriend has created and maintains. I sometimes invite a friend over for a cup of tea or an afternoon cocktail, but otherwise I read in my Adirondack chair or nap in my hammock. I used to race around to galleries and museums, theater and films, and/or parties and events. Now, as a septuagenarian, I am content to watch the hummingbirds frisk in the burbling fountain, the clouds cross the sky and the neighbors’ trees dance in the breeze.” — Jim Van Buskirk, San Francisco

For years, I’ve wanted to go with my childhood best friend and her family, and we finally made it happen this June. The best part of the trip was that we had time to just be together. We sat on the beach, reading and listening to the waves. We had a barbecue at which my friend, who’s a teacher, got to spend time with a grad student at U.C.S.D. who was once one of her third graders. One night we had dinner at Piatti, an Italian restaurant that has a big tree in the middle of the patio seating area. We had the kind of intergenerational engaging conversation that had us thinking, laughing and looking up to see that they were closing up the restaurant around us.” — Rebecca Scott, Los Angeles

Three years after the pandemic brought live music to a halt, the touring business is thriving: 2023 brought in record revenue — over $9 billion — thanks in part to major outings by Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, and in part to increased prices across the board. Live shows are also becoming more ambitious in scale and filigree, underscoring how big concerts are becoming experiential luxury goods.
But even though the live music space is thriving, there is still persistent growling about Ticketmaster and its fee structure, and also about rising prices in general. Social media amplified both the thrills of some live events, and also confusion over cratering ticket process for others, like some recent dates on Travis Scott’s tour.
On this week’s Popcast, a conversation about why this year was such an impressive one for the touring business, what lessons established acts are learning from younger arena and stadium stars, and whether the continued pressure on ticket price is sustainable in the long run.

2023-12-24,"If you have not kept up with the latest scandal in the world of young adult publishing, it is a doozy. It involves a debut author with a lot of buzz, lies, clumsy alibis, “review bombing,” a long and sordid confession — and, of course, Goodreads. Because whenever there is a meltdown in publishing, Goodreads, the Amazon-owned site that bills itself as “the largest site for readers and book recommendations,” is reliably at the center of it.
You might wonder if Goodreads isn’t just an enabler of scandal but the problem itself.
But first, the scandal: Internet sleuths figured out that an author named Cait Corrain, whose debut novel was scheduled for 2024, had created fake accounts on Goodreads in order to review-bomb other books — overwhelming them with negative one-star reviews. When confronted online, she concocted a fake online chat to divert blame to a nonexistent friend; when that hoax was uncovered, she confessed, citing a “complete psychological breakdown.” Her publisher and her agent dropped her; the planned publication of her novel was canceled. As often happens in these scandals, the use and abuse of Goodreads — a site whose cheery name masks a recent history of abhorrent user behavior — has left many people hurt and at least one person’s career in ruins.
Goodreads is broken. What began in 2007 as a promising tool for readers, authors, booksellers and publishers has become an unreliable, unmanageable, nearly unnavigable morass of unreliable data and unfettered ill will. Of course, the internet offers no shortage of bad data and ill will, but at its inception Goodreads promised something different: a gathering space where ardent readers could connect with writers and with one another, swapping impressions and sharing recommendations. It’s an idea that’s both obvious (the internet is great at helping like-minded people assemble) and essential (reading is a solitary activity, but there is great joy in talking through a book afterward). In fact, Goodreads is still an essential idea — so much so that it’s worth fighting to fix it.
When I joined the site in 2007, I felt I had finally found my place online. At the time, I was still using a physical notebook to keep a list of the books I’d read or wanted to read, so discovering a place to track, rate and review books felt entirely, if you’ll pardon the word, novel. After Amazon’s acquisition of it in 2013, Goodreads seemed primed to either sink or soar. While Amazon had won few fans in the book community, thanks to its predatory business practices, it is also the foremost online marketplace for books, and so a companion site dedicated to discussing books seemed an obvious and potentially beneficial complement.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But Goodreads quickly began to languish in an awkward limbo — neither a retailer nor an inviting online salon. Still, it’s become the most popular book discussion site, by far, with a reported 125 million members as of late 2022. As book coverage and criticism have been slashed in other areas of popular media, Goodreads, by default, has taken on an outsize role in the book world’s imagination. But it’s also devolved into a place where users’ worst instincts are indulged or even encouraged.

Whether it’s the rampant practice of review-bombing books that are listed online long before publication (often targeting young adult novels that have acquired a whiff of offensiveness, some of which are ultimately pulled from publication) or the internet hecklers hounding beleaguered authors or those beleaguered authors tracking down their Goodreads hecklers and publicly shaming them, the combative culture of Goodreads is antithetical to the spirit in which it was started. My as-yet-unpublished memoir in essays already has two ratings on Goodreads, but it won’t even go out to early readers until next year. It’s become routine for publishers to warn authors that Goodreads is a site meant for readers, not for writers — which is to say, what was intended to be a forum for engagement is now a place authors enter at their peril."
2023-12-25,
2023-12-26,"Twelve months ago, Tom Lee bet that 2023 was going to turn out just fine.
While many of his peers on Wall Street were sounding the alarm over an impending economic downturn, Mr. Lee, a stock market strategist who spent more than a decade running J.P. Morgan’s equity research before setting up his own firm, forecast in December 2022 that falling inflation and economic resilience would buck the broadly bearish mood.
Mr. Lee was right. Despite political brinkmanship over the nation’s debt ceiling, a banking crisis in March, fears over the cost of funding the government’s fiscal deficit, a continuing war in Ukraine and fresh conflict in Israel, the core of Mr. Lee’s prediction came to fruition in 2023. Inflation has fallen, unemployment remains low, and the S&P 500 has risen 25 percent.
Most investors disagreed with Mr. Lee’s prognosis; in 2023, they pulled more than $70 billion out of funds that buy U.S. stocks, according to data from EPFR Global. Only a quarter of fund managers whose performance is benchmarked to the S&P 500 have beaten the index’s returns this year, according to Morningstar Direct.
“2023 was a year that people were so convinced we would have a recession and they looked at everything through that lens,” said Mr. Lee, head of research for Fundstrat. “Then there were folks like us that said we don’t know the future but there is little evidence a recession is coming.”

Heading into 2024, prognosticators tracked by Bloomberg share Mr. Lee’s optimism more broadly, including analysts at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Binky Chadha, an equity strategist at Deutsche Bank who bet against the consensus with Mr. Lee last year, is also predicting that the bull rally will continue.
At the same time, analysts at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and others maintain that the absence of a severe downturn in 2023 doesn’t mean it has been avoided altogether, since the full effect of higher interest rates is still working through the economy.
“There are a lot of things that have to go right to still come out the other side unscathed,” said Mike Wilson, chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. He revised his bearish bets in July, although even then he didn’t budge from his stance that the economy would worsen.
Central to both views is the path of inflation and whether the Federal Reserve can return the pace of price rises back to its target of 2 percent before the economy sputters.
The Fed began putting the brakes on the economy in March 2022 by raising interest rates. But the central bank has recently appeared confident that it is getting close to its target. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.1 percent over the year through November, down from a peak of over 9 percent through June 2022. Core C.P.I., which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remains at 4 percent.

The sooner the Fed gets to its target, the sooner it can start to take its foot off the brakes of the economy. The central bank recently forecast lower interest rates next year. Even without rate cuts, falling inflation and historically high wage growth could embolden consumers to keep spending, offering a tailwind for corporate profits to soar even higher, Mr. Lee said.

Others are less confident. While the labor market remains strong, recent months have shown early signs of weakness, with a modest rise in unemployment as more people begin seeking work. Credit card delinquencies and the number of people overdue on car loan repayments are also rising, as investors note that consumer finances have become more stretched after the repeal of plans to forgive student loan debt. With inflation still above the Fed’s target, these cracks could widen in the coming year.
Jason Hunter, an equity strategist at J.P. Morgan, said the market appeared to be ignoring an expected slowdown in growth next year. “The equity market looks like it is priced for a very rosy outcome,” he said.

While the service side of the economy, such as restaurants, has held up well this year, manufacturing has struggled after a stretch of overproduction in 2022.

Energy stocks remain negative for the year, after being the standout performer in 2022. Utilities stocks — typically a haven when other parts of the market are in turmoil, thanks to their steady income stream — have fallen more than 10 percent since January. Smaller companies, too, have languished, with the Russell 2000 index still roughly 15 percent off its previous peak and18 percent higher for the year.
For Mr. Lee and the growing herd of market bulls, these unloved areas of the market offer an opportunity in 2024. A turn in the manufacturing slump, as companies work through the backlog of inventories and begin placing new orders, could help companies that struggled in 2023 catch up.
Mr. Chadha of Deutsche Bank noted that economists had consistently underappreciated the amount of growth in the economy this year. He thinks it’s likely to happen again.
“We think we will get positive-growth surprises that will propel equities higher,” he said.
Those who are more bearish say that a manufacturing recovery is far from assured and that the slide in those sectors of the market in 2023 could be a warning that if it weren’t for a few behemoth technology stocks that lifted the S&P 500 higher, the stock rally would look very different.
These tech stocks have been so dominant, they even earned themselves the nickname the Magnificent Seven. It’s a group that boasts some of the biggest companies in the market: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla. Without them, the S&P 500 would have risen around 10 percent this year.

“If average companies don’t see an improvement, that to me is the risk of a hard landing,” Mr. Wilson of Morgan Stanley said. “If we are going to have a recession, it’ll be when these businesses decide to start letting people go.”
For Mr. Lee, history suggests a different outcome. When the S&P 500 has risen by at least 15 percent for the year, which has happened 28 times back to 1950, the index has risen by another 10 percent the next year half the time, and is positive over 70 percent of the time, he said. And when interest rates have previously been between 3 and 5 percent, the valuation of the stock market has been similar to what it is now, suggesting the rally isn’t overdone.
“People are trying to be too theoretical about the stock market,” Mr. Lee said. “The acceptance of chaos is a more correct way to approach the market.”"
2023-12-27,"As 2023 comes to a close, our monthly showcase of hidden gems on your streaming subscription services showcases a handful of worthwhile releases from this year that may have escaped your notice: character-driven dramas, dark comedies, smart documentaries, and romantic comedies both sunny and disturbing.
‘A Thousand and One’
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
The writer and director A.V. Rockwell begins this wrenching character drama in New York City circa 1994, and nicely recaptures the look and feel of Gotham indies of that era. But that’s not just window dressing. While ostensibly telling the story of a young woman trying to go straight after a stint at Rikers Island and raise her son, Rockwell folds in relevant reminders of the city’s history in the intervening years and adroitly incorporates them into her characters and their ongoing struggle, reminding us that “quality of life” policing and the dirty business of gentrification are never purely policy issues. Yet it’s more than just a polemic; Teyana Taylor is shattering as the mother in question, Josiah Cross is charismatic and sympathetic as her teenage son, and the revelations of the closing scenes are wrenching and powerful.

‘Rye Lane’
Stream it on Hulu.
A sensation at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, the debut feature from the director Raine Allen-Miller is a zippily paced and endlessly satisfying compressed-timeframe romantic comedy (think “Before Sunrise” and its follow-ups) with a delightfully of-the-moment voice and feel. Dom (David Jonsson) and Yas (Vivian Oparah) meet-cute in an art gallery bathroom; he’s crying in a stall over a fresh breakup, and she’s nursing a broken heart as well (albeit more quietly), and they wind up spending a few whirlwind hours baring their souls and helping each other settle their romantic scores. It’s a venerable setup, rendered with vibrancy and inventiveness by Allen-Miller, and the screenplay by Nathan Bryon and Tom Melia is full of witty, quotable dialogue. But the whole thing would fall apart without the bulletproof chemistry of Jonsson and Oparah; you want them to end up together so much, and that’s half the work of a great rom-com.
‘Rotting in the Sun’
Stream it on Mubi.
Another Sundance breakout, this pitch-black comedy finds the director Sebastián Silva also starring as himself — or rather, a depressed and suicidal version of himself. After nearly drowning at a gay nude beach, Sebastián meets a charismatic but insufferable American influencer, Jordan Firstman (playing himself, and admirably game about it), who tries to engage him in a collaboration. What follows is both psychologically bruising and uncomfortably funny, while posing thought-provoking questions about guilt, privilege and the omnipresence of social media. Most impressively, it reminds us that L.G.B.T.Q. stories don’t have to be about positive representation; Silva allows his queer characters the complexity to be as annoying, difficult and exploitative as his story requires.

‘El Conde’
Stream it on Netflix.
Pablo Larraín, the director behind “Jackie” and “Spencer,” cooks up his most unconventional riff on the biopic yet with this stylized hybrid of dark comedy, social commentary and gore-heavy horror. The premise is delicious, positing that the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) was, in fact, a literal vampire who faked his own death and went into hiding in the country. The razor-sharp script, by Larraín and the Chilean playwright Guillermo Calderón, ruminates on the parasitic nature of capitalism, wit and intelligence, and the cleverness of the narration (which not only tells the story but wryly comments on it) is topped only by the reveal of who is voicing it. Ed Lachman’s black-and-white cinematography stuns, and Larraín injects the proceedings with genre thrills and bleak laughs.
‘Sanctuary’
Stream it on Hulu.
Margaret Qualley and Christopher Abbott both make brief but impactful appearances in “Poor Things,” one of the awards favorites of the season; viewers who enjoy that cockeyed meditation on sexual mores will find themselves equally fascinated by the duo’s provocative spring two-hander. Abbott stars as Hal, the wealthy scion of a luxury hotelier who is about to take over as the company’s chief executive; Qualley is Rebecca, who first appears to be interviewing him for the job, but is gradually revealed to be his longtime dominatrix, acting out a scene of his own creation. Their tricky psychosexual exchanges, a complex series of shifting power plays and deeply embedded desires, make for situations both highly dramatic and unabashedly erotic — the kind of movie for grown-ups it feels like they never make anymore, until they do.

The title, for those not in the know, refers to a subgenre of exploitation movies prompted by the earthshaking success of “Jaws”— increasingly silly and derivative stories of shark attacks, grizzled sailors, frustrated scientists, corrupt politicians and swimsuit-clad human sacrifices. Stephen Scarlata’s giddily entertaining documentary tracks the evolution of these pictures, from the direct rip-offs of the ’70s and ’80s to their utterly insane contemporary counterparts, the cheapo disaster hybrids of the “Sharknado” ilk. But it also drills deeper, running down the history of sharks in fiction in general, as well as the (often negative) effects these works have had on the public perception of these much-maligned animals.
‘De Humani Corporis Fabrica’
Stream it on Mubi.
The latest effort from the accomplished documentary filmmakers Véréna Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor combines a distinct nonfiction film style — the fly-on-the-wall institutional portrait, most frequently identified with Frederick Wiseman, focusing on a French hospital — and a more experimental approach, utilizing specialized cameras to explore the interiors of the human body during medical procedures. The latter footage, while not for the squeamish, is fascinating, taking a detached and almost fantastical view of our organs and orifices that’s akin to the landscapes of phantasmagorical science fiction. But the straightforward documentary sections are equally transfixing, forgoing talking head interviews for overheard conversations and operating room chitchat (“This guy’s weirdly put together!”), and capturing moments of staggeringly raw emotion and vulnerability."

2023-12-29,"If you were planning on watching the final season of “Jack Ryan” or eight seasons of “House” without commercials on Amazon Prime next year, get ready to dig a little deeper into your pockets.
In September, Amazon announced it would soon add advertisements to Prime Video, its streaming service, and this week announced when that change would go into effect: Jan 29. Customers wanting to avoid the ads would have to pay an extra $2.99 a month.
Less than a decade ago, the streaming era took off on the promise of letting users cut the cord from expensive cable bills and enjoy a blissful ad-free viewing experience. But as we enter 2024, Amazon isn’t the only service bringing back ads or driving prices higher.
Studios and streaming companies that make all this entertainment say they are struggling, and that it’s getting increasingly hard to attract new customers. The result is higher prices, or plans that are cheaper but include ads.
There are also other measures. This fall, Netflix announced a price hike and said it would start clamping down on users who share their passwords with people outside of their households for free.
To help you make a choice for the new year, here’s what some of the main streaming services will cost and what they will offer. (All prices are in U.S. dollars and apply to U.S. accounts.)

2023-12-31,"The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. Each month, we’ll choose three nonfiction films — classics, overlooked recent docs and more — that will reward your time.
‘Sympathy for the Devil’ (1970)
Rent it on Amazon and Apple TV.
The most well-known documentary to center the Rolling Stones is almost certainly “Gimme Shelter,” the Maysles brothers’ chronicle of the band’s 1969 concert at Altamont Speedway, a movie that infamously captured the fatal stabbing of a concertgoer. But the weirdest documentary the Stones have appeared in is “Sympathy for the Devil,” first shown in 1968. The director was none other than Jean-Luc Godard, in the process of pivoting between the brilliance of “Weekend” and the barely watchable politicized films he would make with what was called the Dziga Vertov Group. In the recent documentary “Godard Cinema,” “Sympathy for the Devil” is held up as the director’s last bourgeois film before the rupture.
Far more interested in process than product, “Sympathy for the Devil” cuts back and forth between the Stones in the recording studio as they refine what would become one of their best-known songs, and scattered material that Godard shot around London. The studio sessions are hypnotic; the camera tracks around the room in lengthy shots as the Stones try to find a groove, although they’re often undercut by metallic-sounding voice-over from what Roger Greenspun, reviewing the film for The New York Times in 1970, described as a “now famous pornographic political novel,” whose text Godard uses as an alienation effect.
In between clips of the band, Godard intersperses various provocations: scenes of Black militants operating from a junkyard by the Thames; a bizarre interlude at a book and magazine shop where a man in Elton John-style glasses reads from “Mein Kampf,” and heiling Hitler appears to be part of the checkout procedure; and Godard’s then-wife, Anne Wiazemsky, playing a person called Eve Democracy, who responds yes or no — mostly yes — to nonsensical questions from a television reporter. Graffiti and hand-painted title cards engage in Godard’s customary wordplay, albeit this time in English (“FBI + CIA = TWA + PANAM”). An unbroken closing shot exposes the machinery of tracking, craning and tilting.
The version streaming is technically not Godard’s. His was titled “1 + 1” (or “One Plus One,” or “One + One,” depending on your source), ostensibly after the idea of putting contradictory ideas together. It did not play the Stones’ completed song all the way through at the end. Richard Brody’s comprehensive Godard book “Everything Is Cinema” gives an account of how the two versions of the film were at one point meant to be screened in counterpoint at the 1968 London Film Festival. In New York, “Sympathy for the Devil” and “1 + 1” alternated days. “If you go on Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Sunday, you will see Godard’s film,” Greenspun wrote.

“The Last of the Unjust” is one of several films by Claude Lanzmann (1925-2018) that can be considered an offshoot of “Shoah” (1985), his nine-and-a-half hour film on the Holocaust that, for many, represents the finest cinematic statement on the subject. “The Last of the Unjust,” completed almost three decades later, revolves around a set of interviews that Lanzmann conducted in Rome in 1975 with a former Vienna rabbi named Benjamin Murmelstein.

Murmelstein was the final chairman of what the Nazis called the Jewish Council at Theresienstadt, the show camp that they had established outside Prague to parade their ostensibly humane treatment of the Jews before the world. He essentially functioned as an intermediary between the Jews and the Nazis at the camp. Inevitably, after the war, he was accused of collaboration. Murmelstein’s description of his role is a bit different. He says that a council’s “elder” (the Germans’ term, which Lanzmann notes had tribal connotations) was always “between the hammer and the anvil.” Murmelstein adds, “The person in that position can deaden a lot of blows.”
Exactly how many blows he deadened, how he did it and why are the essential questions that Lanzmann teases out over the course of the film. Murmelstein, who in Vienna had already been assigned by Adolf Eichmann to investigate the topic of emigration, had the opportunity to flee to London in 1939 and didn’t. “Do you want me to admit that I felt I had a mission to carry out and that’s why I didn’t leave?” he asks Lanzmann. “Does that seem so strange?” He volunteers that he had what he calls a “thirst for adventure” and doesn’t deny a taste for power. But if his position meant he could get more visas for more Jews from the British consul, so much the better.
He vigorously pushes back against Hannah Arendt’s description of Eichmann as embodying the “banality of evil.” (“He was a demon,” Murmelstein says.) His recollections of Theresienstadt become, in effect, the story of his efforts to bolster the Nazis’ propaganda efforts in order to save more lives by saving the camp. “If they hid us, they could kill us,” he says. “If they showed us, they couldn’t. Logical!” That 33,000 Jews died at Theresienstadt, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, might give some sense of the grim calculus he was facing.
Lanzmann, who supplements the 1975 conversations with then-present-day visits to the sites in question, clearly likes Murmelstein, who died in 1989. The film’s parting note — with the men walking off in friendship — only adds to the complexity of the emotions the movie evokes.
‘Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street’ (2021)

Last month in The Times, Sopan Deb got the scoop on how Cookie Monster’s cookies are made. What happens behind the scenes of “Sesame Street” is an endless source of curiosity — not least because most of its viewers watch it before they’ve begun to think about how television programs are made.
“Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street,” a documentary from Marilyn Agrelo (“Mad Hot Ballroom”), takes its cues and its title from a book by Michael Davis. But you can’t really tell the story of “Sesame Street” without clips, and that makes this documentary tough to resist. Who today — or ever, really — would think to harness tried-and-true methods of advertising and turn them toward educational ends? “Every child in America was singing beer commercials,” says Joan Ganz Cooney, the first executive director of the Children’s Television Workshop. “Now where had they learned beer commercials?”
Jon Stone, a longtime writer, producer and director on the show, recalls that the idea for the brownstone set came from a commercial for the Urban Coalition. (The reasoning being that any city kid would know that the streets are more fun than being cooped up upstairs.) The show depicted a multiracial neighborhood long before it was fashionable to show one on TV. And some of the most fascinating tidbits recounted in the film deal with the sensitivity of “Sesame Street” to children’s psychology. When the actor Will Lee, who played Mr. Hooper, died, the show’s creators made Mr. Hooper’s death a part of the show, in part because to do otherwise would have broken the program’s ethos of being truthful to children."
