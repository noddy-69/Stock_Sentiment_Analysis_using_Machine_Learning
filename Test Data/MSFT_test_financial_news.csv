2022-01-03,"Hiba Bég, a graduate student in the United States, was visiting the grave of her grandmother in New Delhi over the weekend when she learned that she was “for sale” to the highest bidder online — for a second time in less than a year.
Her screen filled with dozens of calls and messages from friends, all sharing the same screenshot of the profile created of her on the app, a fake auction site called “Bulli Bai.” Ms. Bég, a former journalist with an active online presence, wasn’t alone. More than 100 other prominent Indian Muslim women, including artists, journalists, activists and lawyers, found that online images of themselves were being used without permission on the app, which went up on Saturday and was taken down again within about 24 hours.
In June a similar app, called “Sulli Deals,” appeared. (Both terms are derogatory slang for Muslim women.) That one remained up for weeks and was taken down only after complaints from victims. Though the police opened an investigation, no one has been charged in that case.
India’s online space is rife with misogyny and harassment of women. But the two “auctions” have amplified concern about the organized nature of the virtual bullying, and how targeted smears and threats of violence, particularly sexual violence, are deployed to try to silence women, especially those critical of some of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies.

“The intimidation is aimed at forcing Muslim women who raise their voices against the injustice to withdraw from public life,” said Ms. Bég, 26, who is pursuing a graduate degree at Columbia University. “But you don’t back off, even if everything gets overwhelming.”

Muslim women were at the forefront of one of India’s largest protest movements in recent decades. In early 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic began in earnest in India, thousands blocked roads and held demonstrations in protest of a new citizenship law that was seen as prejudiced against Muslims.

Women featured in the “auction” included Fatima Nafees, the mother of a student activist who disappeared more than five years ago after a fight with members of a right-wing student organization; a film star turned social activist, a researcher, and several other prominent Muslim women.
Both the app that went up in June and the more recent one were hosted by GitHub, a Microsoft-owned open software development site based in San Francisco. On Sunday, India’s federal minister for communications, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said that GitHub had blocked the user behind the recent app. GitHub has not commented publicly on the episode.

Karti Chidambaram, a member of India’s Parliament and a leader of the opposition Congress party, wrote on Twitter that he was appalled that those responsible apparently felt emboldened because of the government’s lack of action on the previous auction.
“It is unacceptable that this project of dangerous anti-Muslim misogyny is back,” he said.
On Monday, the police in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh said they had opened an investigation and filed a criminal complaint against several Twitter handles and developers of the app, based on the complaint of a Muslim woman.
But many complaints said the lack of progress on the previous investigations had inspired little confidence.
For years, Ms. Bég has been a vocal critic of India’s governing Hindu nationalists and their anti-minority policies under Mr. Modi. She has faced intense internet trolling, including death threats, on Twitter.
Over the years, as the pressure has intensified, she said, she started self-censoring, avoiding critical posts on the policies of the Hindu nationalists.

She said she had been worried about the rising intolerance, but the latest episode showcased how the online machinery was being used to make vocal Muslim women withdraw from public life, essentially eliminating any counternarrative.
Hasiba Amin, a social media coordinator of the opposition Congress party, who was also featured on the auction app, says the fact that the violence and death threats against minorities online have recently gone beyond virtual is what keeps her awake.
“What guarantees do we have from the government that tomorrow the threats and intimidation online is not going to turn into the real-time sexual violence on the streets?” she asked."
2022-01-04,"On Christmas morning, I woke up early and flipped on CNN, where I found the newscaster toggling among three news stories — two really depressing ones and an amazingly uplifting one.
The first depressing story was the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. The other was the looming anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Both the threat from the virus and the distorted beliefs about the attack on the Capitol were being fueled by crackpot conspiracy theories circulated by Facebook, Fox News and Republican politicians.
But then there it was — sandwiched between these two disturbing tales — a remarkable story of U.S. and global collaboration to reach a new scientific frontier.
It was the launch at 7:20 a.m. Christmas Day of the James Webb Space Telescope. According to NASA, “thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians” — from 306 universities, national labs and companies, primarily in the U.S., Canada and Europe — contributed “to design, build, test, integrate, launch and operate Webb.”

Thank you, Santa! What a gift to remind us that a level of trust to do big, hard things together is still alive on planet Earth. By operating from deep in space, Smithsonian magazine noted, “Webb will help scientists understand how early galaxies formed and grew, detect possible signatures of life on other planets, watch the birth of stars, study black holes from a different angle and likely discover unexpected truths.”
I love that phrase — unexpected truths. We have launched a space telescope that can peer far into the universe to discover — with joy — unexpected truths.

Alas, though, my joy is tempered by those two other stories, by the fact that here on Earth, in America, one of our two national parties and its media allies have chosen instead to celebrate and propagate alternative facts.
This struggle between those seeking unexpected truths — which is what made us great as a nation — and those worshiping alternative facts — which will destroy us as a nation — is THE story on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurgency, and for the coming year. Many people, particularly in the American business community, are vastly underestimating the danger to our constitutional order if this struggle ends badly.

If the majority of G.O.P. lawmakers continue to bow to the most politically pernicious “alternative fact” — that the 2020 election was a fraud that justifies empowering Republican legislatures to override the will of voters and remove Republican and Democratic election supervisors who helped save our democracy last time by calling the election fairly — then America isn’t just in trouble. It is headed for what scientists call “an extinction-level event.”
Only it won’t be a comet hurtling past the Webb telescope from deep space that destroys our democracy, as in the new movie “Don’t Look Up.”
No, no — it will be an unraveling from the ground up, as our country, for the first time, is unable to carry out a peaceful transfer of power to a legitimately elected president. Because if Donald Trump and his flock are able in 2024 to execute a procedural coup like they attempted on Jan. 6, 2021, Democrats will not just say, “Ah shucks, we’ll try harder next time.” They will take to the streets.
Right now, though, too many Republicans are telling themselves and the rest of us: “Don’t look up! Don’t pay attention to what is unfolding in plain sight with Trump & Company. Trump won’t be the G.O.P.’s candidate in 2024.”
Who will save us?
God bless Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the two Republican House members participating on the Jan. 6 investigation committee. But they are not enough. Kinzinger is retiring and the G.O.P. leadership, on Trump’s orders, is trying to launch Cheney into deep space.

I think our last best hope is the leadership of the U.S. business community, specifically the Business Roundtable, led by General Motors C.E.O. Mary Barra, and the Business Council, led by Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella. Together those two groups represent the roughly 200 most powerful companies in America, with 20 million employees. Although formally nonpartisan, they lean center-right — but the old center-right, the one that believed in the rule of law, free markets, majority rule, science and the sanctity of our elections and constitutional processes.
Collectively, they are the only responsible force left with real leverage on Trump and the Republican lawmakers doing his bidding. They need to persuade their members — now — not to donate a penny more to any local, state or national candidate who has voted to dismantle the police or dismantle the Constitution.
Yes, that’s false equivalency. Nothing is as big as the Trump cult’s threat to our constitutional order. But it’s still relevant. For a lot of Americans, watching a smash-and-grab gang ransack their local mall and violent crime jump — and then seeing the far-left trying to delegitimize, defund or dismantle their police — is just as frightening as those trying to dismantle their Constitution on the Capitol mall.

I believe there are many Americans in the center-left and center-right who vigorously oppose both, and they think it’s a disgrace when progressives tell them not to worry about the first or when Trumpers tell them not to worry about the second.

When you take both seriously, many more people will listen to you on both. Individually, in their hometowns — like mine, Minneapolis — business leaders have effectively pushed back on dismantling the police. Now it is time for America’s business leaders to just as forcefully push back on the Trump Republicans trying to dismantle the Constitution.
Why should they risk alienating pro-Trump lawmakers who soon may control both the House and the Senate? Besides love of country?
Let me put it crassly: Civil wars are not good for business. I lived inside one in Lebanon for four years. Corporate America shouldn’t be lulled by 2021’s profits, because once a country’s institutions, laws, norms and unstated redlines are breached — and there is no more truth, only versions, and no more trust, only polarization — getting them back is almost impossible.
Can’t happen here? It sure can.
Rick Wilson, a longtime G.O.P. strategist opposed to Trump, recently described to The Washington Post what will happen if the campaign by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and other Trump cultists succeeds to get more Big Lie promoters elected in 2022 — and the G.O.P. takes the House or Senate or both: “We’re looking at a nihilistic Mad Max hellscape. It will be all about the show of 2024 to bring Donald Trump back into power.” He added, “They will impeach Biden, they will impeach Harris, they will kill everything.”
So what will big business do? I wish I were more optimistic.
CNBC reported Monday that data compiled by the watchdog group Accountable.US “shows that political action committees of top corporations and trade groups — including the American Bankers Association, Boeing, Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin and General Motors — continued to give to the Republican election objectors.”

Kyle Herrig, president of Accountable.US, said in a statement: “Major corporations were quick to condemn the insurrection and tout their support for democracy — and almost as quickly, many ditched those purported values by cutting big checks to the very politicians that helped instigate the failed coup attempt. The increasing volume of corporate donations to lawmakers who tried to overthrow the will of the people makes clear that these companies were never committed to standing up for democracy in the first place.”
The leaders of these companies are totally underestimating the chances that our democratic institutions will unravel. And if American democracy unravels, the whole world becomes unstable. That will not exactly be good for business, either.
Neutrality is not an option anymore. As Liz Cheney put it on Sunday: “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both.”
So, my New Year’s wish is that item one on the agenda for the next meetings of both the Business Roundtable and the Business Council will be: Which side are we on?

In response to the riot, corporate America has changed some practices in the past year — and returned to others.

One year later
On this morning a year ago, we did not know just how fragile American democracy would prove to be. The U.S. Capitol would soon become an unimaginable scene: A deadly riot by a mob encouraged by President Donald Trump and other Republicans objecting to their loss in the 2020 presidential election and seeking to overturn the result.
This shocking event forced a reckoning for businesses. Companies were called to task for their political lobbying and spending, having directly and indirectly supported candidates and groups that opposed certifying the election. Many business leaders committed to changing their policies. A month after the riot, we asked whether this would prove a turning point or a momentary blip. A year later, here’s what has and hasn’t changed.
Companies continued giving to lawmakers who tried to discredit the election. Promises to stop or pause funding to the 147 members of Congress who opposed certification did not always hold. Companies that made initial commitments have since donated nearly $2.4 million directly to these lawmakers’ political campaigns and leadership PACs, according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
Overall, since the riot, more than 700 corporations and trade groups have given $18 million to groups that benefit those lawmakers, including the national Republican committees for the Senate and House. A handful of major companies, including American Express and Microsoft, have affirmed that they will not donate any money to the election objectors this year.

A push for more information about corporate political activity gained momentum. Last year, public company shareholders, including major institutional investors, approved more proposals than ever before asking for disclosure of company political spending, the Center for Political Accountability found. Companies also made oversight of donations a priority for directors, where previously middle management often handled such matters.
Corporate leaders took a stand on voting rights. In March, more than 70 Black executives called on corporations to oppose legislation that restricts voting in response to the swift passage of a Georgia law limiting ballot access, one of many such bills introduced by Republican state lawmakers. In April, hundreds of companies signed a statement in support of ballot access. (There were notable holdouts who wanted to stay above the political fray.) Some business leaders banded together to ask Washington for help in their states, but a national voting rights law has yet to pass.
On this somber anniversary, some business groups have reaffirmed the commitments they made a year ago to support the legitimacy of elections, stressing that democracy is a “critical foundation for capitalism.” Michael Porter, the Harvard Business School professor, said “we are at an inflection point in our nation’s democratic history, with unprecedented attacks on voting rights and our electoral system,” adding that “protecting our democracy must become a top priority for business and political leaders.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The Fed may raise rates faster than expected. Minutes from the central bank’s December meeting, released yesterday, show that top officials saw a stronger economy ahead and worried about inflation. Stocks fell sharply on the news, with tech companies tumbling the most.
Flight cancellations surpass 1,000 for an 11th straight day. Nearly 1,700 flights were canceled yesterday, bringing the total since Christmas Eve to over 22,000. Labor shortages, in part because of coronavirus cases, were to blame.
WarnerMedia declares its pandemic streaming strategy a success. HBO and the HBO Max platform ended 2021 with nearly 74 million subscribers, surpassing expectations. WarnerMedia’s chief, Jason Kilar, said the news validated his decision to put his studio’s movies on HBO Max the same day they hit theaters, a move that angered Hollywood.
A notable short-seller is taking on Tesla. Fraser Perring, who identified fraud at Wirecard years before the German payments company collapsed, said he is betting that Tesla’s highflying stock price will crash. “I’m short again,” Perring tweeted. Tesla’s stock fell 5 percent yesterday, though its market cap remains above $1 trillion.
A Fed official’s stock trading disclosures raise questions. Richard Clarida, the central bank’s departing vice chair, previously came under fire for buying shares in a fund in early 2020, a day before the Fed announced potential pandemic support measures. The Fed initially described Mr. Clarida’s purchase as a routine, planned move. But a newly amended disclosure shows that he had sold that same fund a few days before.

Djokovic’s latest court battle
After being detained at a Melbourne airport, the Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic was denied entry to Australia amid suspicions about his medical exemption from getting the coronavirus vaccine. The move throws into doubt his entry to the Australian Open — and raises thornier questions about vaccine mandates.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Rules are rules,” Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, tweeted of the move. It capped a whirlwind of developments: Djokovic, who had kept his vaccination status under wraps for months, was granted a last-minute exemption to Australian rules requiring visitors be vaccinated or stay in quarantine for 14 days, allowing him to attend the Open. (Tournament officials said medical experts involved in the exemption didn’t know his identity, and a “handful” of exemptions for other players were granted.)
But government officials questioned the validity of Djokovic’s exemption, particularly as Australia is suffering a rise in coronavirus cases, and ultimately rejected his visa. Djokovic will be allowed to stay in the country (at a quarantine facility) through at least Monday, as he appeals the deportation in court.
The case is the latest flash point in sports over vaccination. Fellow players and tennis fans had criticized the decision to give Djokovic an exemption; organizers of other major tournaments like Wimbledon and the U.S. Open haven’t yet said what their vaccination rules will be. In basketball, the Brooklyn Nets recently reversed course and let their star Kyrie Irving, who is unvaccinated, return to the court.
And tensions remain over vaccine mandates more broadly. President Emmanuel Macron of France, who said he wanted to “piss off” unvaccinated people, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada are seeking to profit politically from anger against those refusing inoculation. In the U.S., a number of government employees, from postal workers to Navy SEALs, are continuing to refuse vaccination and legal challenges to mandates are mounting.

Checking in on CES
As we noted in yesterday’s newsletter, CES, the tech industry mega-conference in Las Vegas, is now open to the public, its first in-person edition since the start of the pandemic.
The last time it was held in person, in January 2020, it drew more than 171,000 attendees and 4,400 exhibitors. Conference organizers expected a smaller turnout this year, because of pandemic restrictions and rising coronavirus cases. A conference spokesperson told DealBook that yesterday the expo drew tens of thousands of visitors and about 2,200 exhibiting companies.
CES veterans reported a more subdued atmosphere than before, but noted that the conference halls were far from empty.

The case for less testing
Amid rapidly rising coronavirus case counts and short supplies of tests, starting tomorrow vaccinated travelers entering England will no longer need to submit a test before their journey, the British government announced yesterday. In the U.S., public health officials have faced criticism in recent days for not recommending a negative test before people infected with the virus end a five-day isolation period.
But Tinglong Dai, a professor of operations management and business analytics at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, says less testing, not more, may be the best way through the next phase of the pandemic. Dai, who spent the beginning of the pandemic researching the most effective and equitable ways to distribute vaccines, recently co-wrote a paper on the problems of overtesting. He spoke with DealBook about his research; the interview has been edited and condensed.
Why test less?
A lot of people are getting a positive diagnosis but they are not so contagious. The P.C.R. tests are very sensitive and good at telling you if you have Covid, but don’t say how contagious you are. And with the Omicron situation, we are generating way too many positive results.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
What about rapid tests?
I am a bigger fan of the rapid test. And the Biden administration should be able to buy them at about $5 each. Right now we are paying more than that because manufacturers are making a risk calculation that demand could go down. If the government gave the manufacturers more certainty that it would continue buying tests, then the cost would go way down, perhaps to $2 a test.
What about the accuracy of rapid tests? Isn’t that a problem?
Not really. Most people are worried about false negatives. I am not actually that concerned about it. If you have continued concerns, you can do another test. A second negative, especially after waiting a day, and you can rule out Covid. In general, your chance of being infectious is very low if you test negative on a rapid test.
Do we have enough rapid tests to rely on them?
The global Covid-19 antigen test supply is estimated to be about $6 billion in 2022. Using that, we get a worldwide capacity of roughly three billion rapid test kits. Assuming that one-third flows to the United States, we have an annual capacity of one billion test kits.
But that’s only three tests per person. Is that really enough?
We won’t have enough to allow us to do rapid testing on a routine basis, as Germans have been doing for a long time. But it is all relative to what we decided about the need for testing. Do experts say more testing should be done? I don’t know a lot who do. I think it is more about allocating the testing resources we have than not having enough.

2022-01-10,"Google wrongly claimed attorney-client privilege to protect documents subpoenaed in a National Labor Relations Board case filed by former employees who say the company fired them because of their unionization efforts, a labor judge has ruled.
The administrative law judge, Paul Bogas, whom the N.L.R.B. appointed as a special master to review the documents, said in a report on Friday that “this broad assertion is, to put it charitably, an overreach.”
The ruling is the latest legal blow to Google’s defense against a complaint, brought by the labor agency in December 2020, that said the company illegally fired and surveilled employees who were involved in labor organizing.
A Google spokeswoman, Jennifer Rodstrom, said in a statement on Monday that the matter had nothing to do with unionization but was about employees breaching security protocols. “We disagree with the characterization of the legally privileged materials referred to by the complainants,” she said.
Judge Bogas ruled in November that Google had improperly characterized 71 of 80 documents sought by the former employees as privileged. The latest report covers around 200 additional documents pertaining to communications around Google’s hiring of IRI Consultants, a firm known for its anti-union work, as part of Project Vivian, an effort to fight labor organizing at the company.
Google must hand over nearly all of those 200 documents, Judge Bogas ruled. He also ordered the company to produce for his review more than 1,000 additional documents that it logged as privileged.

2022-01-12,"The latest Covid-19 wave has left millions of Americans scrambling for tests, braving long lines in the cold at pop-up sites or searching furiously online for kits to use at home. But for a select group of employees at some of the country’s largest companies, tests are free and often readily available.
Without an adequate federal system for developing and distributing rapid tests, companies have put their own testing services in place.
Google will send full-time employees in the United States free at-home tests that deliver results within minutes and retail for more than $70 each. BlackRock, an investment firm that manages nearly $10 trillion in assets, offers tele-health supervision as employees self-administer rapid tests for international travel. At JPMorgan Chase, bankers, including those at its retail sites, can order at-home rapid tests from an internal company site.
Some companies are using the tests to call their staff back to the office. For others, at-home Covid testing has become the newest wellness benefit, a perk to keep employees healthy and working — even from their couches — while providing peace of mind.

The testing available to a small number of white-collar professionals underscores the difference between their pandemic experience and that of other Americans, putting them at an advantage over many, including workers at small businesses without the means to procure testing kits for their staffs. Like personal protective equipment and vaccines, tests have become the latest example of how a tool to battle the pandemic can exacerbate social and economic divides.
“We’re the epicenter of the epicenter and I can’t get test kits anywhere,” said Thomas Grech, president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, which has roughly 1,400 members that employ about 150,000 workers in the borough.
Some employers secured contracts with companies that supply or administer tests in the earlier months of the pandemic, before the Omicron variant unexpectedly drove up demand. Following the advice of experts, some are incorporating testing as part of their return-to-office protocols.
Belle Haven Investments, an asset management firm in Westchester County in New York with only 40 employees, has been storing tests in a supply closet.

“We’re trying to stockpile them,” said Laura Chapman, chief operating officer of the firm, which has not mandated a return to the office, though many workers have voluntarily come back. She added that the company was ordering only as many tests as employees were demanding, and that they were facing shortages: “Those tests, man, those home tests are so hard to get.”

In the United States, the federal government has moved more slowly than other countries to authorize rapid antigen tests for everyday use. Britain, for example, was quicker to approve rapid tests as a public health tool, leading to faster production. And unlike Washington’s approach to vaccines, the development of rapid tests has until recently been mostly financed by private companies like Abbott Laboratories. The result is a nationwide shortage of tests.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
Americans who cannot get tests are often left to wait in lines that can run as long as three hours. Or they can try to buy at-home tests online or in stores. Walgreens and CVS last month announced limits on the purchase of at-home rapid test kits at stores.
The Biden administration has stepped up its efforts to make tests more broadly available and affordable, requiring insurer reimbursement for tests, invoking the Defense Production Act and announcing plans to ship 500 million tests to Americans. The United States is expected to have one billion rapid tests by the end of this year, or three tests per person, according to Tinglong Dai, a professor at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The country is now reporting more than two million tests a day on average, up from about 500,000 last summer and higher than at any previous point in the pandemic.
Joseph Allen, an associate professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said earlier coordination on the national level could have “flooded the market” with tests and made them more available for everyone.

“It doesn’t surprise me that many organizations who were recognizing they need these tests to stay in business were buying them,” Dr. Allen said.

BlackRock, which has more than 7,600 U.S. employees and has extended its work-from-home flexibility through Jan. 28, offers its staff up to one at-home P.C.R. testing kit each week, up to six monthly at-home antigen kits for employees or their family members exposed to Covid, and tele-health supervision for self-administered rapid tests needed for international travel, an option begun over the December holidays.

At Morgan Stanley, bankers can receive up to four free BinaxNOW tests, which cost about $40 in stores, every two weeks through a third party, though the shortage of tests has delayed shipment arrival. At JPMorgan, where corporate employees said they were told last month that they could temporarily work from home because of the fast-spreading Omicron variant, bankers can order rapid tests.
TIAA, an investment firm with 12,000 workers in the United States, began offering free at-home testing to its staff in December 2020. The majority of its employees have worked from home since the start of the pandemic, though roughly 5 percent had been coming into the office last year. There is no limit on the number of tests employees can order, for themselves as well as their family, according to a spokeswoman, Jessica Scott.
“The goal of offering that is providing comfort to our employees so they don’t have to unnecessarily worry or be burdened by having to find a test outside the home,” said Sean Woodroffe, the firm’s head of human resources.
TIAA is considering expanding its testing options, by exploring a partnership with the company Detect, which makes at-home molecular tests. “We’re not hoarding tests,” Mr. Woodroffe added. “We have tests to fulfill our demand.”
Google’s full-time employees in the United States have access to multiple types of coronavirus tests they can take at home, the company said. Since last year, employees have been able to request P.C.R. tests provided by a company called BioIQ. Employees collect a nasal swab at home, and it is processed in the company’s lab.

Google also distributes to employees who want one a small testing device that produces results in minutes.
To perform the rapid molecular test, employees insert a cartridge into the reader, swab their nose and place the swab in the cartridge for results sent by phone. The test is made by Cue Health, a company that provided testing for the National Basketball Association’s bubble.

Google signed a deal with Cue Health in April to provide its employees with the test kits, according to a securities filing.

Cue Health also had a prior contract with the federal government and assisted it in distributing the tests across 20 states.
Consumers can now buy one of the readers directly from Cue Health for $250, and a 10-pack of the test cartridges retails for $712. Google gives employees 10 tests with the Cue Health reader, and will cover the cost of up to 20 more test cartridges per employee each month. (Cue Health said it offered memberships for consumers, which include discounts on tests and the reader.)

Google uses many temporary workers, vendors and contractors who do not get access to the Cue Health tests, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. A spokeswoman for Google said temporary workers and vendors may use the at-home P.C.R. tests performed by BioIQ if they were coming into Google’s American offices.
Other technology companies have taken more limited approaches to testing. Microsoft offers free rapid antigen home tests to employees on its campus, said a spokesman, Frank Shaw. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, provides testing at around 10 of its offices for employees who have returned for in-person work, said Tracy Clayton, a press officer for the company.
But for many businesses, and their workers, tests are far harder to come by.
Jesus Caicedo-Diaz, who owns Skal, a restaurant in Brooklyn, said his employees were struggling to get Covid test results before the business opened at 10 a.m., with testing lines often running hours long by early morning.
Finding at-home tests is an even greater challenge. “They’re nowhere to be found. They’re all gone. If you do find them, they want $30 for them,” Mr. Caicedo-Diaz said. “If you go to a test site they tell you your result won’t come on time. I don’t know how to navigate this. It’s driving me crazy.”"
2022-01-13,"Stocks tumbled on Thursday in a late sell-off led by shares of technology companies, ending two days of relative calm on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite slid 2.5 percent, losses that wiped out gains made by both benchmarks over the past two days.
Thursday’s trading echoed a wave of selling that hit markets last week, with large technology weighing on the broad market. Tesla, one of the biggest companies in the S&P 500, was one of the worst performers in the index, falling 6.8 percent. Microsoft fell 4.2 percent, Amazon dropped 2.4 percent, and Apple and Google slid about 2 percent.
The Nasdaq is down more than 5 percent this year, and the S&P 500 is down more than 2 percent, a decline that has come as investors adjust their expectations for interest rates in the year ahead as the Federal Reserve looks to get inflation under control and cuts its support for the economy.
The central bank is already slowing its bond-buying program, and it has signaled that it could soon raise interest rates and begin to shrink its asset holdings in a bid to further cool off the economy.
“We have a set of tools — they are very effective — and we will use them to bring inflation back down,” Lael Brainard, a Fed governor whom President Biden has nominated to become the central bank’s vice chair, said on Thursday at a Senate hearing. Economists expect the Fed to begin raising interest rates as soon as March.
Rising interest rates discourage risk-taking by investors, which tends to hit tech stocks more than others. What’s more, shares of many technology companies trade at high valuations because of fast growth and expectations that they will produce significant profits in the future. But higher interest rates put future growth in doubt and make those future earnings worth less to current investors."
2022-01-14,"Over the last two decades, workers without four-year college degrees have lost ground in the occupations that used to be ladders to middle-class lives for them and their families.
While the trend has been well known, putting a number on the lost steppingstone jobs has been elusive. A new study, published on Friday, estimates that such workers have been displaced from 7.4 million jobs since 2000.
The research points to the persistent challenge for the nearly two-thirds of American workers who do not have a four-year college degree, even as some employers have dropped the requirement in recent years.
“These workers have been displaced from millions of the precise jobs that offer them upward mobility,” said Papia Debroy, head of research for Opportunity@Work, the nonprofit that published the study. “It represents a stunning loss for workers and their families.”

Opportunity@Work is part of an emerging coalition of groups that seek to change the culture of hiring and promotion in corporate America. They are trying to encourage a shift to hiring and career development based on people’s skills rather than degrees.
Part of that effort is to create a body of research that highlights the problem but also the untapped potential of workers.
The group’s researchers analyzed employment trends across a wide variety of occupations. The jobs included business managers, nurses, software developers, sales supervisors, financial analysts, purchasing agents, industrial engineers and administrative assistants.
Had workers without college degrees maintained the share of those jobs they held in 2000, there would have been 7.4 million more of them by the end of 2019, the study concluded.
A previous study by Opportunity@Work, with academic researchers, dissected skills in different occupations and found that up to 30 million workers had the skills to realistically move to new jobs that paid on average 70 percent more than their current ones.

Some major companies have started to adjust their hiring requirements. Rework America Business Network, an initiative of the Markle Foundation, has pledged to adopt skills-based hiring for many jobs. Companies in the group include Aon, Boeing, McKinsey, Microsoft and Walmart.
OneTen, a nonprofit, has gathered commitments from dozens of companies to pursue the goal of hiring or promoting one million Black workers without college degrees to jobs with family-sustaining incomes over the next decade. The companies include Accenture, AT&T, Bank of America, Caterpillar, Delta Air Lines, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, Merck, Target and Wells Fargo.
The drive to increase work force diversity is one motivation for the change. Screening by college degree hits minorities particularly hard, eliminating 76 percent of Black adults and 83 percent of Latino adults.
But companies and labor experts also emphasize the competitive and economic benefits of tapping a wider pool of capable workers.
“The country as a whole will benefit from not stranding human capital,” said Erica Groshen, an economist at Cornell University and a former head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

There is recent evidence that the pandemic shortage of workers may be prompting companies to loosen degree requirements. A study published this month by Keith Wardrip, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, compared online job listings in the five quarters before Covid hit and the five quarters after.
In the pandemic period, there were 2.3 million more postings for what he classified as opportunity employment jobs — those that pay more than the median national wage of $36,660 and are accessible to workers without a four-year college degree.
Much of the increase was due to the higher demand by companies that were short of workers as many people pulled out of the job market for health concerns, family obligations or personal reasons. But Mr. Wardrip found that 38 percent of the increase was attributable to lower education requirements for some jobs.
Major companies that have moved to skills-based hiring in recent years say the shift has given them a stronger, more diverse work force.
A few years ago, Wells Fargo, as part of a broader review, was rethinking its hiring and career development practices. A question at the time, recalled Carly Sanchez, executive vice president for hiring and diversity recruiting, was “are we eliminating some of the best talent?”

The bank decided it was and changed its practices. Today, more than 90 percent of jobs at Wells Fargo do not require a four-year degree, “almost a total reversal for us” from five years ago, Ms. Sanchez said.
Accenture began an apprenticeship program in 2016. What started as a small corporate citizenship initiative, with fewer than 20 apprentices, has become a significant part of the technology consulting and services company’s recruiting and hiring.
This week, Accenture announced a goal of filling 20 percent of its entry-level positions in America through its apprenticeship program in its current fiscal year, ending in August. The company expects to have 800 apprentices this year.
The apprentice hires, the company said, have excelled in measures like productivity and retention. They often bring skills and traits nurtured in past jobs or in military service like teamwork, communication, persistence and curiosity — so-called soft skills that are important to clients in technology projects.
In the shift to skills-based hiring, Opportunity@Work and other groups refer to such workers as STARs, for skilled through alternative routes. The term is meant to emphasize the skills that a large share of American workers have acquired instead of a degree that they lack.

Accenture’s apprenticeship program began by preparing people for back-office technology support roles, but it has become a path to higher-skilled tech jobs working on client projects, said Jimmy Etheredge, the chief executive of Accenture North America.
“I’ve been surprised by how far the apprenticeship program has gone in the technology roles,” he said. “I had not thought it would get as big as it has.”
After finishing the yearlong apprentice program, Del Walker, 28, of Chicago, became a full-time Accenture employee in 2020. Ms. Walker, like 80 percent of those who have gone through the program, does not have a college degree. But she has held a series of jobs, completed community college coursework in nursing and information technology, and is a graduate of Year Up, a national nonprofit job training program.
Ms. Walker is currently a software engineering analyst, working with Accenture’s software development teams and clients — recently a large fast-food company. She has mastered technical skills like basic programming and software testing techniques, and is adding to them both on the job and by taking online courses on her own.
“If there’s a new skill set, I’m learning it,” said Ms. Walker, whose goal is to become a software developer at Accenture.

Tensions brew between Russia, Ukraine and the U.S.
Extensive negotiations last week did not defuse the security crisis that Moscow has ignited in Eastern Europe. Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides by 100,000 Russian troops, and Russia has issued subtle but wide-ranging threats, including hinting that it could place nuclear missiles close to the U.S. if the West did not meet its security demands.
Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, wants to extend Russia’s sphere of influence to Eastern Europe and secure written commitments that NATO will never again enlarge. If he is frustrated in reaching that goal, his aides have suggested that he will pursue Russia’s interests with results that will be felt acutely in Europe and the U.S.
U.S. officials are threatening to throw their weight behind a Ukrainian insurgency should Russia invade. On Friday, the White House accused Moscow of sending saboteurs to stage an incident in Ukraine to create a pretext for invasion.
Cyber conflict: Microsoft said on Saturday that it had detected highly destructive malware in Ukraine that appeared to be waiting to be set off by an unknown actor. The day before, hackers brought down several Ukrainian government websites.
Ukraine’s forever war: Russian belligerence has drawn the world’s attention back to the eight-year-old secessionist rebellion in the Donbas region: a deadlocked, time-warped conflict with no end in sight."
2022-01-17,"The title of Rosemary Sullivan’s important new book, “The Betrayal of Anne Frank,” resounds far beyond its primary meaning. Sullivan is chronicling the investigation of a cold case, the unsolved mystery of who alerted authorities in the summer of 1944 to the hiding place of Frank, her family and four other Jewish people, above a pectin and spice warehouse in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam, resulting in their arrest and deportation to concentration camps. Two official investigations, begun in 1947 and 1963, failed to reveal the identity of the informant; the matter has preoccupied multiple biographers since. Sullivan writes with absolute dedication and precision, bringing a previously obscure suspect to the fore.
But Frank, who died at 15 of typhus at Bergen-Belsen days after the death of her sister, Margot, has been betrayed in so many ways. Some would say by having her diaries published at all: initially in 1947 by her father, Otto Frank, the owner of the warehouse at Prinsengracht 263 and the only survivor of the group, who made omissions for propriety that were restored in later editions. (Mild sexual themes and rebelliousness against Anne’s mother, Edith, newly incited the kind of school communities that had previously suppressed the work for being a “real downer.”)
Still, Anne Frank wanted fervently to be a professional writer, and had revised her diaries with eventual publication in mind. More questionable than any variation of her text are the shiny-eyed spinoffs that resulted from its global success: plays, movies, musicals, a graphic adaptation, a children’s book from a cat’s point of view, a YouTube series that reimagines her with a video camera instead of a pen, postcards, cotton totes: the Anne Frank franchise. Too often she has been idealized as a symbol of the indomitable human spirit rather than contextualized as a victim of genocide deserving justice.
Sullivan, a poet and the prizewinning author of books including “Stalin’s Daughter” and “Villa Air-Bel,” about a safe house in Marseille during World War II, is amply qualified to resituate readers in reality. She is riding tandem here with Thijs Bayens, a filmmaker, and Pieter van Twisk, a journalist and researcher whom Sullivan describes as having “the cragginess of all bibliophiles.” In 2016, Bayens and van Twisk, both of whom are Dutch, hired Vince Pankoke, a retired F.B.I. agent in Florida who “still seems to be living undercover, a mild, anonymous man in a guayabera shirt.” They assembled an international cold case team of criminologists; behavioral, data, forensic and social scientists; psychologists; a handwriting expert; a rabbi; and many others, among them a young student who wondered, in one of the narrative’s few lighter moments, “What’s a telephone book?” They’re eager for any information you might have, too.

The team has used modern big-data techniques and an artificial intelligence program developed by Microsoft, as well as old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting, conducting scores of interviews and combing through private and public archives. The team has the receipts, as the young student might say — often actual receipts, thanks to the diligent record-keeping of German bounty hunters. Shaped like a procedural or a whodunit, “The Betrayal of Anne Frank” nonetheless hums with living history, human warmth and indignation. It agilely shifts the idea of “collaboration” over eight decades and nearly 400 pages, from dark and insidious crime to noble quest with algorithmic transparency.
Bayens and company were shocked to discover what Sullivan dryly calls “the degree of acrimony among the various stakeholders of the Anne Frank legacy.” Her title also seems to be a nose-thumbing to the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel, Switzerland — one of two charitable organizations started by Otto Frank — which has long aggressively protected its portion of the diaries’ complicated international copyright and would not cooperate with the cold case team; one trustee even thundered in an early meeting that the investigators couldn’t use Anne’s name. The other, the Anne Frank Foundation in Amsterdam, which has turned Prinsengracht 263 into a well-trafficked museum, was much more helpful, Sullivan writes.
Possible informants, according to various theories: a “suspiciously inquisitive” warehouse manager, Willem van Maaren; Lena Hartog, his assistant’s purportedly gossipy wife; Job Jansen, a former employee who called Otto Frank treasonous for daring to imply during a casual sidewalk encounter that the Third Reich might lose the war; and a “shady character” and “cocky opportunist” named Anton Ahlers. Still other candidates: a Jewish “V-Frau” named Ans van Dijk — “v” stood for vertrouwens, the Dutch word for trust — who turned in fellow Jews to avoid being deported herself; and Nelly Voskuijl, who was the sister of a woman who helped to conceal the Franks, and who consorted with the enemy and suffered from fainting spells.
At least one historian has suggested that there was no informant — that the police came to the warehouse to search for counterfeit ration cards or labor violations and happened upon the secret annex hidden behind a moving bookshelf, perhaps noticing marks it had left on the floor. Sullivan circles all of these possibilities like Agatha Christie with Zoom and a time machine. The mingled mundanity and terror of the town square is all too present in details such as what would happen when a moving company, run by Abraham Puls, came to pick up deportees’ possessions; gawking neighbors called this being gepulst (pulsed).

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Eventually the team wends its way to Arnold van den Bergh, a prosperous Jewish Dutch notary fingered in an anonymous letter to Otto Frank that was uncovered in the 1963 investigation and is given new forensic scrutiny in these pages. The argument the investigators make for van den Bergh’s culpability is convincing, if not conclusive. “I truly believe that investigating the past and our interpretation of it is not a finite exercise,” Pankoke writes in an afterword.
Thankfully, this is followed by a glossary. The banality of evil that Hannah Arendt provocatively located in the form of Adolf Eichmann is superseded in these pages by the bureaucracy of evil, which is so often also “the bureaucracy of the absurd,” as Sullivan notes: an alphabet soup of agencies that helped render the vilest crimes against humanity pseudolegal and systematic. Names and terms accumulate and the mind can blur. But the facts of Frank’s devastatingly curtailed life command attention. Here, her famous diary is not literary work to be plundered at will, but Exhibit A in a mountain of damning evidence."
2022-01-18,"SEATTLE — Microsoft plans to buy the powerhouse but troubled video game company Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion, its biggest deal ever and one that places a major bet that people will be spending more and more time in the digital world.
The blockbuster acquisition, announced on Tuesday, would catapult the company into a leading spot in the $175 billion gaming industry. Games on virtually every kind of device, from bulky consoles to smartphones, have gained even greater popularity during the pandemic. Technology companies are swarming around the industry, looking for a bigger share of attention and money from the world’s three billion gamers.
In an industry driven by big franchises, Activision makes some of the most popular titles, including Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Yet the company has been roiled in recent months by an employee revolt over accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination.
Microsoft framed the deal as strengthening the company’s hand in the so-called metaverse, the nascent world of virtual and augmented reality. The metaverse has attracted huge amounts of investment and talent, though so far is more of a buzzword than a thriving business. Facebook renamed its parent company to Meta late last year to underscore its commitment.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But the focus on the futuristic metaverse belies the significance of the deal in the present: The acquisition helps Microsoft gain on its rival Sony in the long-running battle for gamers’ attentions and wallets by offering top titles. It also helps the software giant stay ahead of powerful newer competitors in gaming, like Amazon and Google.
Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft’s gaming business, said that whatever the metaverse may end up being, “gaming will be at the forefront of making that mainstream.” For now, he said, the acquisition is about gaining a stronghold in mobile gaming, where Microsoft barely competes, and a studio that produces hugely popular games. He called Call of Duty “one of the amazing entertainment franchises on the planet.”
Federal regulators may raise concerns about the acquisition, as Democrats and Republicans alike have pushed to limit the power of technology giants. On Tuesday, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission announced a new effort to broaden how they should determine if deals are anticompetitive.
Microsoft is valued at more than $2.3 trillion, second only to Apple. The takeover of Activision would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony, the company said. Microsoft now makes Xbox consoles and owns studios that produce hits like Minecraft.
The game industry has been consolidating rapidly. A force behind that — and one that could grab the attention of regulators — is the arms race for exclusive content. Microsoft sometimes makes the games it owns available only on its own devices, such as its Xbox console, and unavailable on those made by competitors, like Sony’s PlayStation.

When asked whether Activision games like Call of Duty would become exclusive to Xbox, Mr. Spencer would say only that “our goal is to allow the content to reach as many players as possible.”
Microsoft has been hunting for ways to spend its immense cash reserve — more than $130 billion — to expand its consumer business. It has looked at acquiring the booming social network TikTok and the popular chat app Discord.
In Activision, which faces accusations that senior executives ignored sexual harassment and discrimination, Microsoft found a target under stress. The allegations have weighed on Activision, with its shares falling 27 percent since California sued the company in July over the claims.
The game maker’s shares rose more than 25 percent in trading on Tuesday. Microsoft’s shares fell by 2 percent.

The transaction may be seen as a victory for Bobby Kotick, Activision’s longtime chief executive, whom some critics had sought to force out over the controversy. Mr. Kotick negotiated a big premium for investors — Microsoft is paying $95 a share, roughly 45 percent above his company’s stock price before the announcement, though only slightly more than the trading price before the scandal broke.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Kotick will stay in his role until the deal is complete. Then the expectation is that he will step down as chief executive, though he could move into an advisory role, according to two people with knowledge of his plans, who would speak only anonymously because the talks were private.
The controversy at Activision began last summer when a California employment agency sued the company over accusations of fostering a toxic workplace culture in which women were routinely sexually harassed and discriminated against. In the ensuing months, employees staged protests, launched social media campaigns and called for executives to resign.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Some top leaders at Activision did leave, including J. Allen Brack, the head of the Blizzard Entertainment subsidiary, and the company pledged $250 million toward increasing employee diversity and said it would strengthen anti-harassment policies. But when The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Mr. Kotick had known for years about accusations of harassment against employees and in some cases had not taken action, calls for his resignation only grew.
Doing a deal with Activision is something of an about-face for Microsoft, which as recently as November was questioning the company’s culture. In an email to Xbox employees that was earlier reported on by Bloomberg and confirmed by the company, Mr. Spencer wrote in November that he was “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at Activision. On Tuesday, he appeared alongside Mr. Kotick to praise the deal, and Mr. Kotick said that he felt the two companies had “similar values and think about our cultures similarly.”

Mr. Spencer said Microsoft “sat down with Bobby and the team and looked at the plan that they have in place,” adding that company culture was always a work in progress. “We are very supportive of the progress that he and the team are making.”
Current and former Activision employees who have been leading the efforts to get the company to reform its culture did not think the purchase was likely to prompt change in the short term, especially because the sale may face a long review from regulators.
The deal could take 12 to 18 months to close, Mr. Spencer said.
“We will continue to fight for improvement and stress proper employee representation,” said Jessica Gonzalez, a former Activision employee and one of the organizers of the ABetterABK activist movement. She added that “this doesn’t change anything.”
Game companies, flush with cash since the pandemic increased the industry’s profits, have been consolidating rapidly. The previous record for the biggest merger in the game industry was set just last week, when Take-Two Interactive, the creator of games like Grand Theft Auto, announced plans to buy the mobile game publisher Zynga for more than $11 billion.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Last year, Electronic Arts and Take-Two engaged in a bidding war over Codemasters, a racing game company that eventually went to EA for $1.2 billion. Microsoft made another splashy purchase in 2020 when it bought ZeniMax Media and its slate of gaming studios for $7.5 billion.
Activision itself was the product of serial deal-making by Mr. Kotick over decades, rolling up smaller game studios. It took shape in its current form when Activision — then known primarily for producing titles for traditional gaming consoles — agreed to combine with the gaming unit of France’s Vivendi to expand into multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft.
Activision later bought King, the European gaming company behind Candy Crush, to expand into mobile games. King produced $1 billion in operating profit during the latest 12-month period.
“Scale truly is a tremendous benefit in the world of gaming,” said Hope Cochran, King’s former chief financial officer, who is now a managing director at Madrona Venture Group. “You want to build a community, and you need enough people to build it.”
Activision’s gaming efforts are facing headwinds. Players panned the most recent Call of Duty release, and releases of titles like Diablo and Overwatch have been delayed. Still, Activision remains quite profitable, reporting $639 million in profit in its most recent quarter.

Mr. Kotick characterized the deal as a calculation that Activision did not have the tools to keep up with big tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Tencent in the rapidly evolving gaming landscape.
“We realized it was going to be an increasingly competitive world with resources that we just didn’t have,” he said.

Russia and U.S. to meet in effort to break deadlock
Seeking to head off a potential assault on Ukraine, Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, will meet with Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, in Geneva on Friday as the two sides explore whether there is still a diplomatic path to avoiding a conflict in Eastern Europe.
Negotiating sessions last week ended in an impasse, with talks deadlocked over Russia’s demand that NATO pledge not to expand eastward. Russian officials said they expected a written “article-by-article” response from the U.S. to their proposals, which would effectively restore Russia’s sphere of influence to close to Soviet-era lines. It is unclear whether Blinken will provide such a response.
A State Department official warned that Russia — which has assembled as many as 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s border — could launch an attack at any time. But in a call with Blinken, Lavrov rejected the idea that Russia was planning to do so and insisted that it was up to Ukraine to calm tensions, according to Russian officials.
Deterrence: The U.S. and its allies have promised to impose punishing sanctions if Russia attacks Ukraine. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, warned Russia of “high costs” in the event of military action, which some have speculated could involve the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

As pressure mounts, Johnson teases an end to some restrictions
Boris Johnson, Britain’s besieged prime minister, indicated yesterday that a plan to ease coronavirus restrictions in England might be in the works, a move that could mollify critics in his restive Conservative Party at a time when political scandals threaten his future in Parliament. His Cabinet will meet today to review the current curbs and to discuss the latest health data.
Under the current rules, introduced in December, people have been urged to work from home if possible and instructed to wear masks in public transportation. “Decisions on the next steps remain finely balanced,” Downing Street said in a statement that urged the public to get booster shots.
Whether Johnson can remain in power may depend on whether a fellow Conservative is willing to start a plot against him. There are many candidates, but the tactics and timing of a leadership challenge are fiendishly tricky. An uneasy lull has settled over Westminster as Johnson’s allies and rivals wait for the results of an internal investigation of the parties held at Downing Street during lockdown that prompted the recriminations.

Anne Frank’s betrayal
A new book, “The Betrayal of Anne Frank,” made headlines this week after naming a Jewish notary, Arnold van den Bergh, as a suspect in the unsolved mystery of who alerted the authorities to the hiding place of the teenage diarist Frank, her family and four other Jewish people, resulting in their deportation to concentration camps.
But many experts said they doubted the theory expounded in the book. “They came up with new information that needs to be investigated further, but there’s absolutely no basis for a conclusion,” said Ronald Leopold, the Anne Frank House’s executive director.
The suspect wasn’t new to historians. Anne’s father, Otto, received an anonymous note that identified van den Bergh as the perpetrator. The book, based on a six-year investigation, claims that van den Bergh had a list of Jews in hiding that he had gotten from the Amsterdam Jewish Council — but researchers say there is no evidence that the council had any such list.
Dara Horn, the author of “People Love Dead Jews,” an exploration of antisemitic attitudes, said the story fit into a trope of Jews turning against Jews. “There’s even a name for this in Jewish studies, called ‘Holocaust inversion,’” she said. “There’s a reason why that’s appealing to a non-Jewish audience. It makes it so you don’t have to think about your own responsibility.”

2022-01-20,"Russia has stationed about 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s government has issued a list of demands that Western powers are highly unlikely to meet. And President Biden said yesterday that he expected Putin to send troops over the border. “But I think he will pay a serious and dear price for it,” Biden added.
Today’s newsletter offers a Q. and A. on the risks of war in Eastern Europe.
“The overall threatening rhetoric from the Kremlin and the movement that military analysts are seeing on the ground give us a lot of ground for concern,” Anton Troianovski, The Times’s Moscow bureau chief, told my colleague Claire Moses. “It’s a very serious situation.”
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia’s foreign minister are scheduled to meet for talks tomorrow in Geneva.

Five questions
1. Why is Putin threatening war with Ukraine?
The honest answer is that most diplomats and experts aren’t entirely sure. “It’s not clear what Russia’s central demand is,” Blinken told reporters yesterday in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.
Even Putin’s top advisers may not know what he is trying to accomplish and how seriously he is considering an invasion, as Anton has written. “The expert opinion that I can authoritatively declare is: Who the heck knows?” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a Russian foreign-policy analyst who advises the Kremlin.
This murkiness allows Putin to declare the confrontation a success in multiple scenarios.
2. Why is the U.S. so alarmed?
A successful invasion would establish Russia as a dominant, expansionist power in Eastern Europe. It would make other democracies (like Taiwan) worry that they could be vulnerable to takeover by nearby authoritarian countries (like China).
3. What does Putin say his rationale is?
Perhaps the best-known statement of Putin’s 20-plus years as Russia’s dominant political figure came from an annual state-of-the-nation speech in 2005 at the Kremlin. The collapse of the Soviet Union, he said, was the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century.
Ukraine was arguably the most painful loss for Moscow. It was the most populous former Soviet republic to form its own country apart from Russia. The two now share a 1,200-mile border, and Putin often cites their deep cultural ties.
But Ukraine has drifted toward the West in recent years. The U.S. and its allies have increased military aid to Ukraine and also said — albeit vaguely — that Ukraine will one day join NATO.
Putin has defended the troop buildup by saying it is merely a military exercise. Russia has also released its list of demands, including a NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine and a pullback of NATO troops in Eastern Europe (effectively to where they were in the late 1990s).
Biden, responding to a question from The Times’s David Sanger at a news conference yesterday, said Ukraine was unlikely to join NATO “in the near term.” But Biden ruled out the idea of removing NATO troops from Eastern Europe.

4. What isn’t Putin saying?
Some observers believe that the troop buildup is a mixture of bluff and distraction.
A group of Russia experts — including Frederick Kagan, who has advised U.S. military leaders in the past — made this argument in a recent report called “Strategic Misdirection.” A full-scale invasion of Ukraine could be bloody and expensive, they wrote, potentially damaging Russia’s economy and Putin’s political standing.
As Kori Schake explained in The Atlantic: “Half a million Ukrainians have military experience; 24 percent of respondents in one recent poll said that they would resist Russian occupation ‘with a weapon in hand.’ Russia might succeed in taking Ukraine, but it is unlikely to hold it.”

Another reason to be skeptical of invasion: So far, Putin does not appear to be preparing Russians to go to war. Russia’s deputy foreign minister continued this pattern yesterday, saying, “We will not attack, strike, invade, quote unquote, whatever, Ukraine.”
Putin may instead be trying to redefine what the West considers unacceptable behavior, Kagan and his co-authors argued. By making an invasion seem possible, Putin can try to win other concessions, such as a freer hand in Eastern Europe.
“In the worst-case version of this scenario, the West will be congratulating itself for having avoided a Russian invasion Putin never meant to launch while Putin quietly celebrates an important nonmilitary victory that the West does not even recognize,” Kagan and his colleagues wrote.

(Thomas Friedman, the Times Opinion columnist, argues that the threat of war also helps distract Russians from their economic problems.)
5. So the risk of war is low?
Not necessarily. Even skeptics like Kagan acknowledge it is possible, given the lack of transparency about Putin’s thinking.
A few analysts, like Melinda Haring of the Atlantic Council, believe war is the most likely outcome: Putin has lost patience with Ukraine, she has written, and believes the U.S. would not go to war over it. (Biden said yesterday that a “minor incursion” would not necessarily pull the U.S. into the fight.) Putin also craves a historical legacy that a territorial expansion could ensure, by helping reverse the catastrophe of the Soviet collapse.
“It’s very hard to gauge the probability,” Michael Crowley, a Times reporter who is covering Blinken’s European trip, told me from Kyiv yesterday. “This is going to require very creative diplomacy to resolve, if it can be resolved.”

A towering force in fashion
André Leon Talley’s approach to fashion could best be described as “more.” More glamour, more decadence, more delight. He evoked drama in both his personal style — wearing capes and furs — and his declarations. “It’s a famine of beauty, honey!” he once proclaimed. “My eyes are starving for beauty!”
Talley, who died this week at 73, was a pioneering figure in fashion. Using his encyclopedic knowledge of fashion history and his quick wit, he became an editor, author, adviser and TV personality. In the 1980s, he worked his way up to creative director at Vogue, and he spent decades there in various roles.
A 1994 New Yorker profile called Talley “The Only One” — a reference to him often being the sole high-powered Black editor in a field that is notoriously white. His influence is hard to overstate: He mentored the supermodel Naomi Campbell and helped dress Michelle Obama as first lady.
Growing up in the Jim Crow South, Talley wallpapered his bedroom with images ripped from Vogue. “I went to school and to church and I did what I was told and I didn’t talk much,” he told Vogue in 2018. “But I knew life was bigger than that. I wanted to meet Diana Vreeland and Andy Warhol and Naomi Sims and Pat Cleveland and Edie Sedgwick and Loulou de la Falaise. And I did. And I never looked back.” — Sanam Yar, a Morning writer

2022-01-21,"LONDON — Standing in front of a golden bandstand, dressed in a white satin gown and pearls, the vocalist Nubiya Brandon sashayed to a gentle beat. Stepping toward the spotlight, she took a lazy turn around the stage, singing a playful calypso number and smiling occasionally at the band behind.
The weird thing about this show, called “All Kinds of Limbo,” was that Brandon appeared to be in this reporter’s kitchen. The singer was in fact an eerily realistic holographic avatar on a mobile phone screen; her performance had been recorded and was now being broadcast in augmented reality from the National Theater in London.
Via the technology’s strange alchemy, which overlays digital imagery onto whatever a camera phone is pointing at, Brandon seemed to be singing and sashaying on the countertop. After she took a bow, her image evaporated and the bandstand faded into nothingness, leaving only a sink full of washing up behind.
The success of digital-only theater productions has been one of the pandemic’s surprise silver linings: Audiences have been willing to try them and theater companies have found fans thousands of miles away. But could immersive technologies provide a more intriguing path forward for drama, one that will endure once Covid-19 (hopefully) subsides? Augmented reality (A.R.) and virtual reality (V.R.) are already changing gaming, music and art; might theater be next?
“All Kinds of Limbo’s” director, Toby Coffey, said he hopes so. In 2016, he set up the National Theater’s Immersive Storytelling Studio, which operates as a kind of “start-up” within the company, he said in a recent interview at the studio’s modest space, which was crowded with a jumble of technical equipment. The team’s brief is to see how live theater and new technologies can interact and intersect.

“Theater makers are naturally fascinated: They’re used to working in 3-D,” Coffey said. “As soon as you bring a director or stage designer or choreographer into V.R., you see their brains whirring.”
The studio’s first production, “Fabulous Wonder.land,” was a V.R. music video featuring a track by the musician Damon Albarn with words by the playwright Moira Buffini. The team has since made 360-degree films of live shows, developed a one-on-one piece in which an audience member interacts with a live actor while wearing a V.R. headset and created a mixed-reality “exhibition” about government welfare cuts.

“All Kinds of Limbo” came into being in 2019 after the National Theater had a hit with “Small Island,” a play about postwar Jamaican immigration to Britain. Coffey and his team commissioned Brandon, the vocalist, and the composer Raffy Bushman to create a 10-minute song sequence responding freely to the play’s themes. It was written, performed and motion-captured that year, and was initially presented as a V.R. experience in one of the theater’s event spaces.

When the pandemic shut down British performing venues in March 2020, Coffey accelerated plans to turn “All Kinds of Limbo” into an at-home experience. The retooled version can be watched via A.R. on a mobile device, via a V.R. headset, or on a regular computer. Brandon’s performance stays the same, but, depending on the device used, the experience feels subtly different.
To summon some of theater’s shared intimacy, it’s being ticketed and broadcast as live, although the show is recorded. Other people attending virtually are represented by blades of moving white light and, by playing with the settings, you can move around the space and see the action from different angles.
It’s a short piece, but “All Kinds of Limbo” does feel like the glimmering of a new art form: somewhere between music video, video game and live cabaret show.
Over the last few years, Britain’s theater scene has become a test bed for similar experiments. Last spring, the Royal Shakespeare Company co-produced an immersive digital piece called “Dream” that featured actors performing using motion-capture technology and was watchable via smartphone or computer. Other projects, such as shows by the Almeida theater in London and the company Dreamthinkspeak in Brighton, England, require participants to turn up in person and get equipped with VR headsets.

Francesca Panetta, a V.R. producer and artist who was recently appointed as the alternate realities curator at the Sheffield DocFest film festival, said in a video interview that practitioners from audio, gaming, theater, TV and other art forms were collaborating as never before. “Many different people are trying to explore this space and work out what it really is,” she said. “No one is quite sure.”
One of the most keenly awaited partnerships is between the immersive theater troupe Punchdrunk, which pioneered live site-specific shows such as “Sleep No More” and “The Masque of the Red Death” in the mid-2000s, and the tech firm Niantic, best-known for the wildly successful A.R. game Pokémon Go.
Speaking by phone, Punchdrunk’s co-founder Felix Barrett seemed invigorated by the creative possibilities. “We’re on the cusp of a new form of entertainment,” he said. “It’s a new genre; it just hasn’t been named yet.”
Later this year, Niantic and Punchdrunk plan to unveil the first results of their collaboration. Barrett was reluctant to reveal too much, but said that it would offer participants “a citywide adventure” that will feel like an immersive video game happening in the real world. “Our goal is to try and make you the hero of your own living movie,” he said.
Ambitious as such projects are, they are also — at least by theater standards — time-consuming and forbiddingly expensive. The Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Dream” wouldn’t have been possible without corporate sponsorship and a hefty grant from a roughly $55-million British government fund promoting digital arts innovation. The latest iteration of “All Kinds of Limbo” relies on a partnership with Microsoft and the livestreaming platform Dice.

There’s also the question of audience. Though theater-led projects such as “Dream” and “All Kinds of Limbo” have gained positive reviews, they have attracted only a tiny fraction of the 12 million viewers who watched a 2020 virtual performance by the rapper Travis Scott in the online game Fortnite. The chances of monetization at scale look slim, at least for now.
And the irony is that, while the pandemic may have whetted audience appetites for digital drama, it has had devastating consequences for theater companies themselves. The National Theater’s Immersive Storytelling Studio originally had four staff members; after belt-tightening layoffs in the company, it’s now just Coffey and one full-time co-worker. “Even before the pandemic, we could have been doing 10 times more than we had resource to be able to do,” Coffey said. “We need to work within those restrictions.”
What happens next is up for debate. The National Theater is working on redeploying the app and distribution platform used for “All Kinds of Limbo” into something that works for other projects. Panetta said that the metaverse, if it genuinely takes off, offers its own possibilities for live performance. “It’s difficult to see what the pathway is; I suspect it’ll be a mix of many different things,” she added.
So how long until we’re watching Ibsen or Shakespeare in augmented reality at our kitchen tables? Coffey laughed, then cautioned that designing successful A.R. performances was still an emerging skill. “But some day it’ll happen, I have no doubt,” he said.

What’s Up? (Jan. 16-22)
Microsoft Strikes a Deal
Microsoft on Monday announced plans to buy the video game company Activision Blizzard for almost $70 billion, its biggest deal ever. The company said the acquisition would help it compete in the so-called Metaverse, the nascent virtual world where some technologists believe we’ll soon live second lives. But Microsoft’s more immediate objective is probably to strengthen its gaming platform. Just as Netflix acquires content to compete for streaming viewers’ attention and subscription fees, Microsoft’s purchase of Activision — the maker of popular games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush — may bolster the library of games for Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft’s $10-a-month Netflix-style video game subscription service. The size of the deal, and the possibility that Microsoft could make some popular Activision titles exclusive to its platform, could bring renewed antitrust scrutiny to the company from federal regulators.
A Clash of Technologies
Airlines warned early in the week that a major expansion of fifth generation cellular service planned for Wednesday could disrupt flights. Unlike previous generations of wireless service, 5G technology uses radio frequencies similar to the ones used by the devices pilots depend on to determine a jet’s altitude, and for years, experts have said it could interfere with that equipment. Flight cancellations and chaos were ultimately avoided by a last-minute decision by AT&T and Verizon to restrict 5G service near airports. President Biden said that federal officials would continue to work with wireless companies, airlines and aviation manufacturers to find a “permanent, workable solution.”
Intel Invests in U.S. Chip Making
Intel plans to build a $20 billion chip manufacturing complex in Ohio, a move that has implications for geopolitics and the supply chain. During the pandemic, manufacturing disruptions and labor shortages caused a shortage of chips, which are mostly manufactured in Taiwan. Legislation that passed in the Senate last year would provide $52 billion in subsidies for the chip industry to help the United States compete with China on innovation by expanding its stake in a foundational technology. Intel plans to start construction in Ohio later this year and to begin producing chips there by 2025. Patrick Gelsinger, Intel’s chief executive, has said Intel might invest as much as $100 billion over a decade in its next U.S. manufacturing campus, with the speed and scope of the expansion depending partly on the availability of federal grants.

What’s Next? (Jan. 23-29)
A ‘New Normal’? Maybe.
Some public health experts hope that as the Omicron wave of the coronavirus recedes, the pandemic could become more manageable. What this would mean for the precautions that businesses take to keep their workplaces safe remains unclear, and policies have continued to shift. In a poll of Manhattan businesses employing 215,000 white-collar workers, almost one-quarter said they didn’t know when their offices would reach half their capacity. Businesses in the hospitality industry say they are struggling to decide when workers who test positive for the virus can return to work. And after the Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s mandate for large employers to require vaccines or testing, Starbucks scrapped a plan to make these requirements for its 200,000 workers.

A Big Push for Big Tech Bills
President Biden and other top Democrats have said that reining in Big Tech is a priority, but lawmakers are running out of time before the midterm elections, when Democrats could lose control of Congress. Over the next few months, they plan to push a handful of proposed laws that reduce the power of companies like Amazon, Alphabet and Meta. On Thursday, a Senate committee voted to advance one such bill that would prohibit tech platforms from promoting their own products over those of others. Other legislation aims to strengthen privacy, make it easier to break up the big tech giants, address misinformation and regulate artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. Most have a long shot at passing: Though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle mostly agree that Congress should do something to increase competition in the tech industry, they have different ideas on how to go about it.
The Fed Meets
Fed officials will meet for the first time this year starting on Tuesday, and at the top of the agenda is fighting inflation. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said this month that the economy no longer needed as much help, and with prices continuing to climb at a record pace, economists expect it to raise interest rates three or four times this year. The Fed has also begun winding down its bond-buying program, which it used to stoke growth during the pandemic. In other economic news that will be watched closely this week: The government will announce on Thursday how much the U.S. economy grew in the fourth quarter.
What Else?
Sales of electric cars passed diesel in Europe for the first time. Shares of Netflix and Peloton, two pandemic winners, plummeted. Amazon released a name for its long-awaited “Lord of the Rings” series. (It’s “The Rings of Power”). And quitting is contagious."

Unilever faces questions about its strategy.

Nelson Peltz’s next target
Unilever has faced pressure on multiple fronts for weeks, including pushback from shareholders over its now-abandoned pursuit of GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer business. Now the consumer goods giant must deal with a potentially bigger headache: Trian Partners, the activist investment firm run by Nelson Peltz.
Trian has amassed a significant stake in Unilever, DealBook’s Michael de la Merced reports. It isn’t clear how big the firm’s holdings are, though Trian began buying shares before Unilever’s pursuit of the Glaxo business became public, according to a source.
Unilever has taken fire over strategic missteps. Investors and analysts scorned the $68 billion Glaxo bid, with Unilever’s shares falling sharply after the company said it still wanted to buy the business, despite being rejected three times. And another big Unilever shareholder accused the company of neglecting business fundamentals while overemphasizing its commitment to climate and social causes.
What does Trian want? It isn’t clear what the activist is pushing for, but Peltz’s firm often demands that huge corporations — including General Electric, Mondelez and Procter & Gamble — simplify and improve their operations, and sometimes calls for them to sell off underperforming divisions. Unilever said last week that it wanted to focus on higher-growth areas like health, hygiene and beauty. Streamlining its operations would be in keeping with recent moves at other conglomerates, including G.E., J&J and Toshiba.
Is a board fight in the future? Trian has won high-profile proxy battles before, including at P.&G. in what was the most expensive war for a board seat on record. Peltz may have support from restive shareholders if he mounts a challenge at Unilever. Shares in Unilever are up 6 percent so far today.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
An activist investor with “grave concerns” pushes Peloton to sell itself. In a letter to the embattled at-home fitness equipment maker, Blackwells Capital called for directors to fire the company’s C.E.O., co-founder John Foley, and to weigh a sale as its shares tumble amid falling sales.  The company is in worse shape now than before the pandemic propelled its growth, Blackwells said, with “high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders.”
Chinese state media puts more pressure on Ant Group. In a documentary, the state-run China Central Television suggested that the Alibaba affiliate made “unreasonably high payments” to the brother of a former government official. (Ant wasn’t mentioned by name.) That turns up the heat on Ant, which scrapped its I.P.O. in 2020 after opposition from regulators.
The Omicron wave may be peaking in the U.S., Dr. Anthony Fauci says. He told ABC yesterday that the latest coronavirus surge was “going in the right direction,” but cautioned against overconfidence. In other pandemic news, public health experts worry that new coronavirus treatments could lead to more resistant strains; The Times takes a sweeping look at President Biden’s efforts to fight the pandemic; and Winter Olympics athletes are going to great lengths to avoid getting sick.
Financial firms want employees back at the office soon. Citigroup told New York-area workers to prepare for a return to office work from Feb. 7, while Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have planned for Feb. 1. In London, where government restrictions are ending on Wednesday, banks are bringing back workers this week.
More workers move to unionize. Employees at an REI store in Manhattan filed for a union election in hopes of organizing 115 workers. Workers at Raven Software, a studio owned by Activision Blizzard that helps create the video game series Call of Duty, are also seeking to unionize. Both follow efforts to organize workers at Starbucks and Amazon in recent months.

Why activists are going after Kohl’s, too
The retailer Kohl’s has received a roughly $9 billion offer to go private in a deal with an investment consortium led by Acacia Research, which is backed by the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch reports. The offer came days after another activist firm, Macellum Advisors, which is threatening a proxy fight with Kohl’s, urged the retailer to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale.
The quick procession of Macellum’s letter and the consortium’s offer could put pressure on Kohl’s to consider a sale — or find another way to boost its share price. Will the pressure work?
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A key question is whether the bidders have the funds to finance a buyout. Starboard has helped Acacia raise equity capital to fund its offer; Acacia has received a letter of confidence from a bank pledging support for arranging debt; and Acacia is in talks with a property firm that would sell off part of Kohl’s real estate to help fund the bid. Kohl’s is up nearly 30 percent in premarket trading, suggesting that investors are taking the bid seriously.
Other buyers may be interested. Sycamore, the private equity firm, has also reached out to Kohl’s about a potential deal, though it’s unclear whether it will lead to an official offer. Sycamore is known for its willingness to take on challenging retail deals, like Staples, but its recent acquisition of the department store chain Belk, which resulted in bankruptcy, may limit its appetite for similar deals. Other large private equity firms remain wary of retail buyouts, but debt is cheap and funds are looking for ways to spend their so-called dry powder.
Part of the pitch is unlocking high e-commerce valuations. Among other things, Macellum is urging Kohl’s to consider splitting its online operations from its brick-and-mortar business, an increasingly popular request by activists. (That’s what Saks has been planning to do.) But many online retailers that went public last year have tumbled, like Lulu’s Fashion (down 48 percent from its I.P.O. price) AKA Brands (down 43 percent) and AllBirds (down 18 percent). Some experts question the logic of separating online from offline, given a push to interweave the two shopping experiences.
Kohl’s has performed better than some of its department store peers, in part because of its smaller stores and off-mall locations, which put it in a better position for today’s shopping habits. It has also signed partnerships with the likes of Amazon and Sephora. But activist investors think it can do better, and the biggest challenge may be its middle-of-the-pack positioning among department stores.

Behind the sports-crypto sponsorship complex
An investor lawsuit, which DealBook’s Ephrat Livni is the first to report, has accused insiders at a crypto company of misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars. The case shines a light on the fast-blooming union between sports and the cryptocurrency industry.
Crypto companies have signed numerous splashy sports deals. Last year the little-known crypto firm DigitalBits, along with a related entity, Zytara, paid around $140 million in sponsorship deals with the Italian soccer clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan, and also secured the services of the soccer star Francesco Totti and the boxer Floyd Mayweather. Now, a major early investor alleges in a suit in New York State Court that company insiders diverted money needed for development to those sports deals, among other things like luxury travel.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Attention from sponsorships has helped raise the profile and price of cryptocurrencies like XDB, the DigitalBits cryptocurrency. DigitalBits describes itself as a “blockchain for brands,” or corporate crypto-based rewards programs, and Zytara says it creates NFTs “to accelerate customer engagement in a unique and trendy way.”
“There is nothing behind the project,” said the plaintiff’s counsel, Adam Ford of Ford O’Brien. He said that reviews of the code reveal little work: The defendants “do not have a publicly accessible blockchain or anything to show other than big-dollar sponsorship deals and constant announcements that the real thing is coming.” DigitalBits and Zytara did not respond to requests for comment.
The hype created by crypto sponsorships is raising concern:
There is growing pressure for crypto promotions in Britain and the E.U. to follow stricter rules on transparency, as crypto sponsorships for sports teams flourish in Europe.
A recent proposed class action lawsuit in California accused Mayweather and fellow celebrity sponsor Kim Kardashian of helping to artificially inflate the price of the cryptocurrency EthereumMax, causing investors losses.
In November, the British soccer club Manchester City backed out of an agreement with an obscure decentralized finance project called 3key, while the Spanish club FC Barcelona canceled a deal with Ownix, an NFT auction platform, amid reports that a company associate was charged with crypto-related fraud.
And then there is the crash in crypto prices, which has erased more than $1 trillion in value since November, with a particularly steep drop in recent days. As a result, blockchain businesses seeking attention may find that they have less to spend on sponsorships — and everything else.

Wall Street’s dizzying swings continued for a second day on Tuesday, again driven by uncertainty about what the Federal Reserve might reveal on Wednesday after its first policy-setting meeting of the year.
Though the trading was not as turbulent as on Monday, when stocks fell 4 percent before ending with a gain, the push-and-pull between buyers and sellers was evident: The S&P 500 fell nearly 3 percent at its lowest point on Tuesday before recouping most of those losses.
The index briefly crossed into positive territory, but ended the day down about 1.2 percent. The Nasdaq composite fell 2.3 percent.
Trading has been volatile with the S&P 500 hovering just above a drop of 10 percent from its January high, a marker known as a correction that signifies the market’s swiftly changing attitude about prospects for stocks in the immediate future.

Investors are focused on the Fed’s next move as it focuses on slowing inflation by pulling back on its support for the economy. The central bank has already said it will soon stop buying government bonds, and investors expect it to start raising interest rates in March.
But stock investors were agonizing over what the Fed may say on Wednesday as it concludes a two-day meeting, and that has led to the big swings in prices this week.
“The market has been behaving incoherently, not knowing whether to go down because the Fed is tightening or go up because the Fed is actually taking action to rein in inflation,” said Anu Gaggar, a strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network. “That’s why tomorrow’s Fed meeting is important. It will provide some much-needed clarity on where the Fed officials’ heads are.”
The worry, which several analysts see as overblown, is that the Fed will decide it is starting its inflation fight too late and move more aggressively than investors anticipate. It’s a concern that belies efforts by the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, to signal changes well in advance so as not to surprise markets.
No matter, there’s no question that investors have become unsettled by the idea that interest rates will rise this year. Higher rates can slow the economy, making borrowing for houses, cars and business costs more expensive. They also discourage investors from bidding up risky assets like stocks.

Part of Wall Street’s concern is that the Fed has room to be aggressive in its fight against inflation because the Omicron variant of the coronavirus appears, by some measures, to be less severe than previous forms. Minutes from the central bank’s December meeting, which it published early in January, also showed that the Fed had discussed moving with more urgency.
Stocks, which hit a peak on Jan. 3, have climbed in only five of 16 trading days this month, and the S&P 500 is now down 9.2 percent from its high.

“This sell-off almost smacks of fears that this will lead to a recession, but the Fed hasn’t even started to tighten,” said Edward Yardeni, an economist. “There is an overreaction here.”
It’s telling, analysts say, that the bond market, which in many ways is more closely tied to the Fed and the economy in general, appears to be taking the current moment in stride.
Typically, when investors grow particularly nervous about the economy, they pile into the bond market — causing prices to rise and bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, to drop.

That’s not happening now. Yields have dipped in the past week, but not by much. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes, for instance, was basically unchanged on Tuesday, and had fallen only slightly in the past week to 1.78 percent.
“The bond market is not willing to move decisively in one direction or another because the economy is still in pretty good shape,” said Vincent Deluard, a strategist at StoneX Group.
That’s not to say investors and the economy aren’t facing some risks. Disruptions are slowing output at factories, companies are struggling to find workers, and rising prices will eat into consumer demand. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund reduced its estimate for global growth to 4.4 percent from the 4.9 percent it projected just three months ago.
The I.M.F. still expects the U.S. economy to grow 4 percent this year, but that would be slower than in 2021. The fund said the failure of the Biden administration’s $2.2 trillion social policy package and the Fed’s tighter monetary policy were among the reasons it had reduced the growth forecast for the United States.
The recent concern about the Fed is also colliding with earnings reporting season, with some of the biggest companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to update investors on the state of their businesses and their outlook for the year. Because of their size, those companies — Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla — can influence the direction of market indexes like the benchmark S&P 500, which they lifted higher as they rose to astronomical valuations in 2021.

This month, all five of those stocks have dropped at least 10 percent, pulling the broad market benchmark lower.
On Tuesday, Microsoft reported sales and profits that were higher than analysts had expected. Its shares still fell more than 5 percent in after-hours trading, suggesting that investors were still disappointed in aspects of Microsoft’s report.
Tesla will report results on Wednesday, Apple on Thursday, and Amazon and Alphabet next week.
It hasn’t all been bad news for company earnings. IBM reported on Monday that its revenue rose 6 percent in the last three months of 2021, and its shares jumped 5.7 percent on Tuesday. Shares of American Express rose nearly 9 percent, making it the best performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, after it reported that revenue rose 30 percent from a year earlier to $12.1 billion amid growth in spending among its card members.
Still, that good news hasn’t been enough to break the Fed’s grip on stock sentiment, though worries about the central bank could ease starting on Wednesday if investors get a better reading on what will happen next.
“The markets really want to have a clear understanding of what the Fed’s going to do and how fast they’re going to do it,” said Lindsey Bell, the chief money and markets strategist at Ally Invest. “Volatility will persist until that larger clarity is truly understood.”

2022-01-26,"For the first time ever, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will be governed by a board that includes people who are not named Gates or Buffett. The question is whether they will have the power to change anything, or even want to.
The foundation on Wednesday named the head of the London School of Economics, a fellow billionaire philanthropist and a founder of a nonprofit management consulting firm to join Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates on a newly created governing board that will oversee the charity.
The establishment of the board was heralded last year as a necessary step after Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates announced that they were divorcing and the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett resigned as the third trustee of the nation’s largest charitable foundation.
The creation of the board “represents an explicit recognition by Bill and Melinda, especially in the wake of their divorce, that the foundation will be well served by the addition of strong, independent voices to help shape our governance,” said Mark Suzman, the chief executive of the Gates Foundation, in a statement. Mr. Suzman will also serve on the board, bringing the total to six members.
ADVERTISEMENT

The new board is a significant symbolic step, one that many philanthropy experts had called for over the course of the foundation’s existence, but in practice little may change. Decisions still require both Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates to support them, in essence handing them each veto power. The new board will also have no control over the endowment, which is held in a separate trust.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given out more than $60 billion in grants over its 21 years, in areas like global public health and agriculture. Most recently, it provided more than $2 billion to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. The foundation paid out $6.7 billion in 2021, the most ever in a single year.
After a decade and a half of relative stability, change at the top of the Gates Foundation came quickly and unexpectedly. First, Bill Gates Sr., a co-chair, died in 2020. Then the couple announced last spring that they would be divorcing. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Buffett said he would step down after nearly 15 years as a trustee.
Under pressure to publicly discuss how the divorce might affect governance at an organization with nearly 1,800 employees that funds work in 134 countries, Mr. Suzman announced in July that big changes would be coming to the foundation, including new board members.
The foundation promised new faces but, perhaps predictably, has not gone with people totally new to the Gates universe. Mr. Suzman declined to comment on whether higher-profile names had been asked but opted not to join the board.

Some observers had wondered if a member of the Obama family might join, for instance. “People with deep, technical expertise in a particular field and some longstanding exposure and engagement with the foundation are key criteria,” Mr. Suzman said.
One new member, Thomas J. Tierney, is co-chair of the nonprofit management consultancy the Bridgespan Group, which has advised the Gates Foundation and many other leading nonprofits and philanthropists, including the billionaire MacKenzie Scott.
The director of the London School of Economics, Nemat Shafik, who goes by Minouche, has also worked with the Gates Foundation in different capacities over many years in government and at prominent nongovernmental organizations. She previously worked at the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of England and Britain’s development agency.
Another new member, Strive Masiyiwa, is a telecom billionaire and philanthropist who has signed the Giving Pledge, which Mr. Gates, Ms. French Gates and Mr. Buffett created as a public promise to give away more than half of one’s wealth. A longtime board member of the Rockefeller Foundation, he has also been chairman of the Gates-backed Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.
Mr. Masiyiwa is working now as the African Union’s special envoy on Covid-19 and has been trying to broker greater vaccine access for the continent. In that capacity, he has at times been critical of Covax, the global immunization program that the Gates Foundation played a critical role in helping stand up.

The foundation was looking for “genuinely strong independent voices, willing to give frank advice in private, and potentially occasionally in public like some of Strive’s,” Mr. Suzman said in an interview.
Ms. French Gates called herself “energized to work with them to drive progress on some of the most important issues the world faces today.”
The board could include up to nine members, with the goal of increasing its representation by gender, geography and expertise under discussion, Mr. Suzman said.
“We’ve known for a long time that Gates is influenced by other wealthy philanthropists and the thinking of development banks, so the inclusion of new members with these C.V.s suggest more of the same,” said Sophie Harman, a professor of international politics at Queen Mary University of London who has written about the foundation in the past. “Fundamentally, I don’t see anyone joining the board who is going to disagree with Bill’s vision.”

The fact that the board did not start with nine members may reflect the difficulty of adding people at a relatively fraught juncture for the foundation. What may have felt like a plum assignment a few years ago would now mean working with the divorced co-chairs as they figure out their relationship.

Many observers were surprised by the announcement last summer that Ms. French Gates will have to leave the foundation if either she or Mr. Gates decides they cannot work together after two years. Mr. Gates has also faced a series of revelations about his behavior with female employees at Microsoft, which he co-founded, and his past dealings with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. There have been no reports of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior toward women at the foundation by Mr. Gates, Mr. Suzman said.
There will be plenty of grist for observers on the foundation’s left flank. Progressive activists have criticized the foundation for emphasizing market solutions, especially in its support of intellectual-property rights for pharmaceutical companies, and for working on problems affecting the developing world mainly through large institutions based in Europe and the United States.
The foundation has added a billionaire businessman in Mr. Masiyiwa and the former worldwide managing director of the management consultancy Bain & Company in Mr. Tierney. Dr. Shafik, a baroness, is a member of the House of Lords and the only woman among the four new board members, despite a significant recent push by the foundation for gender equality in the world.
Yet there was never much chance that grass-roots activists would be lined up for board slots. For those looking for smaller signs of change at the organization, Mr. Masiyiwa was born in Zimbabwe and Dr. Shafik in Egypt. Mr. Suzman, who is from South Africa, said the foundation was interested in adding a board member from Asia.

No former Microsoft executives were named to the board, even though two of the foundation’s past chief executives came from the software company (as did Ms. French Gates and, of course, Mr. Gates).
There are other signs of a slight loosening of the grip of the founders. Mr. Suzman wrote the organization’s 2022 annual letter, a document that Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates had both signed in previous years. The letter — seen as the most prominent articulation of why and how the foundation was spending money — was once a bone of contention in their marriage. Ms. French Gates shared a story of fighting the prospect of her husband’s writing the letter alone in her 2019 book, “Moment of Lift.” Now both have bowed out.
Relatives of members are prohibited from serving on the board, with a carve-out for “a child of the marriage of Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates,” according to the new board governing principles. That suggests that one of the three Gates children, who range in age from 19 to 25, may someday join. The eldest, Jennifer Gates, recently married and is a medical student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Board members will serve three-year terms, with a limit of two terms. Their work is unpaid. The board will meet three times a year, approve the annual budget and assess the chief executive’s performance and pay.
In the interview, Mr. Suzman acknowledged the personal context for these big public changes: the divorce. “Clearly they’re not having the same kind of private discussions at home that they used to have, but our formal structures of the foundation and our decision making is working very effectively,” he said.
But they are still the co-chairs, Mr. Suzman said, emphasizing what remains constant: “I want to be unequivocal. We remain a family foundation.”"
2022-01-27,"Imagine living a virtual reality world where you can have your avatar play video games, shop, hang out with friends, attend concerts and weddings and even travel the world — all without leaving your home.
Or imagine walking down the street and checking the latest sports scores from a digital display that floats in front of you. Or sitting in class with students who are right next to you  — and others who are not.
These are just a few of the scenarios envisioned in a future metaverse, a fully realized digital world that exists beyond the one in which we live.
Do you find the idea intriguing? Exciting? Scary? Are you looking forward to a future when we are always hooked into a virtual world? Or do you fear it will be a dystopian nightmare?
In “What’s All the Hype About the Metaverse?,” Brian X. Chen writes:
The term “metaverse” is everywhere.
On Tuesday, Microsoft cited the so-called metaverse as a reason for acquiring the game developer Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, saying the deal would provide “building blocks for the metaverse.” Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also bet on the metaverse and renamed his social networking company Meta. Google has worked on metaverse-related technology for years. And Apple has its own related devices in the works.
But what does the metaverse really mean, and does it even exist? Here’s what you need to know.
What is the metaverse, anyway?
The metaverse is the convergence of two ideas that have been around for many years: virtual reality and a digital second life.
For decades, technologists have dreamed of an era when our virtual lives play as important a role as our physical realities. In theory, we would spend lots of time interacting with our friends and colleagues in virtual space. As a result, we would spend money there, too, on outfits and objects for our digital avatars.
In what techies like Mr. Zuckerberg call the metaverse, virtual reality serves as a computing platform for living a second life online. In virtual reality, you wear a headset that immerses you in a 3-D environment. You carry motion-sensing controllers to interact with virtual objects and use a microphone to communicate with others.
Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist who has written extensively about the topic, said the metaverse represented the fourth wave to computers, following mainframe computing, personal computing and mobile computing.
“It’s moving into what people call ambient computing,” he said about the metaverse. “It’s about being within the computer rather than accessing the computer. It’s about being always online rather than always having access to an online world.”
That’s it? It’s you and your avatar interacting with others in a digital environment?
To put it simply, yes.
Does the metaverse already exist in gaming?
To some extent, there is already a metaverse in games. But — and it’s an important but — it’s rudimentary.
Some social elements of the metaverse can already be found in video games. Consider Fortnite, an online shooter game played on computers, game consoles and mobile devices. The average Fortnite player spends hundreds of hours in the game with a personal avatar, fighting with and interacting with the avatars of other players. Players also accrue virtual currency that unlocks outfits and other goodies to customize their avatars."
2022-01-28,"The world has been awash in trillions of dollars in easy money since early in 2020. Now, some of that money is going away.
The gush of funds has helped alleviate the suffering inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic and propelled the global economy. But powerful growth — the U.S. economy expanded at a 6.9 percent annualized pace in the last three months of 2021 — has been accompanied by sizzling inflation. Consumers and investors experienced increases in the prices of millions of items and services, ranging from houses, apartment rents and gasoline to the stocks in their portfolios.
As government aid programs wind down, some of the fiscal stimulus has already begun to ebb. And on Wednesday the Federal Reserve said it planned to reverse the monetary stimulus under its control.
These changes have enormous implications for financial markets, which haven’t been handling the news especially well so far. While Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, told reporters about the bank’s intentions on Wednesday afternoon, stocks plummeted, continuing a decline that began on Jan. 3 amid a spreading presumption that Fed policy was shifting.
The Fed is, in a sense, the central bank for the world, and when it changes course, the stakes are high for the entire planet. How far the Fed will go, and what will happen to inflation, economic growth and employment, are crucial questions.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Inflation hasn’t been ‘transitory.’
Inflation is driving the Fed’s shift. The Consumer Price Index in December rose at a 7 percent annual rate, the fastest pace in 40 years.
How much of this inflation has been caused by government and central bank stimulus policies and how much by bottlenecks and behavioral changes set off by the pandemic is the subject of a vigorous debate. The Fed had sided with the camp that said the problem was mainly “transitory” and would ease when the pandemic did. But both the pandemic and inflation have been stubbornly persistent, as Mr. Powell acknowledged on Wednesday. Rising prices are causing hardships for people living paycheck to paycheck, he said, and eroding the wealth of many investors.
First, the Fed plans to raise interest rates.
To combat inflation, the Fed plans to start by raising the Fed funds rate, its benchmark short-term interest rate, which it has held near zero since March 2020. It’s likely to start in March. How high that rate will go, and how quickly, isn’t clear.
The Fed lowered rates to the “zero bound” for the first time during the financial crisis of 2008. It was part of a great experiment, an effort to rescue the shaken financial system and the sinking economy when Ben S. Bernanke was chair.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But the experiment never really ended. Because the economy remained weak, the Fed didn’t begin raising rates until December 2015, and it never got far.
By 2019, when Mr. Powell was chair, the Fed funds rate had reached only 2.50 percent before signs of economic weakness made the Fed stop. In March 2020, it fell back to nearly zero. By contrast, the Fed funds rate was as high as 6.60 percent as recently as July 2000.
So there is reason for skepticism about how far the Fed will be able to go this time. Rising interest rates tend to reduce economic activity, which, in turn, tends to reduce the rate of inflation. Interest on car loans and some credit card loans will rise along with short-term rates, for example. That can be expected to cut demand for cars and, perhaps, thwart further big price increases.
But if the economy weakens too much, the Fed might reverse itself once more. Yet if inflation keeps rising, the central bank could be forced into far harsher measures than it now contemplates.
Next, the $8.9 trillion balance sheet.
After the Fed starts to raise rates, Mr. Powell said, it will use another tool: paring the bonds and other securities on its huge balance sheet.
The assets owned by the Fed swelled in another grand experiment of 2008, known as quantitative easing, in which the Fed began buying bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Those purchases had the effect of lowering interest rates in the bond market.
A broad range of investments by families, private businesses and giant corporations are tied to those rates. And low bond market rates helped to make stocks comparatively attractive and to set off a bull market, which is threatened now by the Fed’s imminent policy reversal: quantitative tightening.
The amounts involved in the Fed’s quantitative easing have been staggering. Back in 2008, the Fed’s balance sheet had assets of $820 billion. They reached $4.5 trillion — yes, trillion — in 2015 and dropped only as low as $3.76 trillion in the summer of 2019. With the coronavirus financial crisis, they have ballooned again, to $8.9 trillion, and may swell a bit more before the spigot shuts. Assets held by the Fed are already more than 10 times their size in 2008, and bigger, as a proportion of gross domestic product, than at any time since World War II.
The Fed’s monetary stimulus accompanied a total of roughly $5 trillion in pandemic fiscal relief by the federal government. Governments and central banks around the world engaged in emergency relief spending, too. The global fiscal and monetary stimulus total amounts to $25 trillion, according to Chris Dillon, a global investment specialist with T. Rowe Price, the asset management company based in Baltimore. This year, that flow is being reduced to a comparative trickle.

The risks of moving at the wrong pace.
Calibrating the combined effects of quantitative tightening and interest rate increases in real time is exceedingly difficult. Cut off stimulus too rapidly and the Fed could further unnerve financial markets. It could conceivably cause a spike in unemployment and a sharp slowdown in growth, plunging the United States into a recession.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Move too gingerly, on the other hand, and the Fed could allow elevated inflation expectations to become embedded, making high inflation even more damaging. The last time that happened, when Paul A. Volcker was Fed chairman from 1979 until 1987, it took brutally high interest rates, soaring unemployment and two recessions to wring high inflation out of the national psyche.
No wonder Mr. Powell said the Fed would need to proceed with “humility.”
The Fed’s task is fraught with risk, said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. The bottlenecks in the economy could clear up if the coronavirus ebbs, which could solve part of the inflation problem.
Through control of the Fed funds rate and its ability to adjust the pace and type of securities it sells when it reduces its balance sheet, the Fed can affect a broad spectrum of interest rates.
Even if the Fed manages to avoid a recession that throws a lot of people out of work, the path ahead is unlikely to be smooth.
For investors, high-quality bonds should help to buffer volatility, and big losses, in stocks. And you could try adjusting your stock holdings. In this environment, for example, T. Rowe Price suggests emphasizing value stocks like AIG, Bank of America and General Electric over growth stocks like Microsoft, Amazon, Visa and Nvidia, and investing globally, especially in emerging markets. Whether those moves will really help, I can’t say.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Fixed-income investors might want to tilt some holdings toward securities of shorter duration, Ms. Jones said. That’s because as interest rates rise, bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, can fall enough to lead to losses, especially for long-term securities. Still, over several years, as bonds are reinvested at higher rates, returns will increase in many bond funds, offsetting short-term losses.
Doing nothing may be a good option if you can afford to withstand some blows and have a diversified portfolio. I’ve been investing in stock and bond funds for decades and believe I’m sufficiently fortified with cash, in case things become really nasty.
If you aren’t ready, it may make sense to sell off some holdings. It’s always smart to be well prepared, even if trouble never shows up at your door."

2022-01-31,"Sony Interactive Entertainment said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire the video game maker Bungie in a deal valued at $3.6 billion, as the game market further consolidates around some of its biggest companies.
This month, Microsoft announced a $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and Take Two Interactive reached an agreement on an $11 billion purchase of Zynga.
Sony Interactive Entertainment, maker of the PlayStation game console and a major game developer in its own right, said Bungie, the original developer of the multiplayer shooter games Destiny and Halo, would operate independently and have free rein to publish games for other consoles and platforms. But the move could help Sony reach new game players.
“This is an important step in our strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience,” Jim Ryan, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s president and chief executive, said in a statement.

Sony and Bungie did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Microsoft acquired Bungie in 2000, and its signature title, Halo, helped turn Microsoft’s Xbox console into a major game platform. But the developer split from Microsoft in 2007 and stopped making Halo three years later. Since 2011, Halo has been developed by 343 Industries, a company owned by Microsoft.
Now, Bungie will be acquired by Microsoft’s biggest rival in the game console market: Sony. Bungie’s most popular current game is Destiny 2, which is available on multiple platforms, including the Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation."

Disney suspended its vaccine mandate for its employees in Florida because of the state’s regulations.

Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel, via Associated Press
Red tape, red states
Now that the Biden administration’s nationwide coronavirus vaccine mandate for large companies has been overturned by the Supreme Court, employers are left to navigate a thicket of state and local rules. In New York, that means private employers have to require vaccines. In Florida and Texas, laws limit the pandemic protocols they can put in place.
And so, the companies that flocked to states like Florida and Texas in search of low taxes and light regulation have found themselves dealing with lots of red tape, at least when it comes to Covid policies. For companies with national footprints that introduced vaccine mandates, or were preparing to do so before the Supreme Court ruling, this makes designing workplace policies more complicated.
The states of play:
In Florida, where 65 percent of people are fully vaccinated, businesses must allow for an extensive list of exemptions to vaccine mandates, effectively making them moot. Violations of the rules can cost as much as $50,000 per incident.
In Texas, where 59 percent of people are fully vaccinated, Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order in October declaring that no employer could compel vaccination for someone who conscientiously objects to it. And businesses that ask customers for proof of vaccination can face stiff penalties, including the loss of a liquor license.
How big companies are reacting:
Disney suspended its national vaccine mandate for employees in Florida, as it works to keep the requirement in place for workers in California.
The Related Companies, which mandated vaccines for all of its employees in April, is no longer requiring them of its staff in Florida.
Several financial firms, including Vanguard and Blackstone, are maintaining vaccine mandates that apply only to people entering their offices.
BP, whose 3,500 Houston office employees are working remotely, is requiring employees to be vaccinated or tested twice weekly once they start going back in person.
Beyond taxes and regulation, vaccine rules could become a factor as states compete to attract business. “It’s a line that they need to straddle very carefully,” said Ian Carleton Schaefer, a partner at the law firm Loeb & Loeb. “To make sure that their politics on the vaccination issue don’t drive away the bigger-ticket issue — like making it an employer-friendly state to do business.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Pfizer will seek approval for its coronavirus vaccine for children under 5. The drug maker said it will ask the F.D.A. to authorize the expanded use; U.S. officials hope that permission will come by month’s end. Meanwhile, Moderna received full approval for its vaccine, and Novavax was seeking emergency approval for its non-mRNA vaccine.

Fed officials suggest they’ll move quickly to cool the economy. Four of the central bank’s regional governors implied yesterday that the Fed will move decisively, not gradually, to withdraw emergency financial support, given the strength of the economy.
AT&T will spin off its stake in its media business to shareholders. The telecom giant said it will give its holdings in the newly merged WarnerMedia and Discovery to its investors after that deal is completed, cleanly breaking from the media industry. It will also cut its dividend accordingly, as it had previously said it would.
Sony will buy the video game studio Bungie for $3.6 billion. The deal to buy the developer of Halo and Destiny follows Microsoft’s $69 billion deal for Activision Blizzard and other takeovers in the industry. (Ironically, Halo is exclusive to Microsoft’s Xbox; Sony said Bungie will still make games for other platforms.) Bankers say that many of the privately owned game studios are happy to remain independent — but could be swayed by richly valued bids.
Speaking of gaming M.&A. … The New York Times Company (hey, that’s us!) is buying Wordle, the hugely popular word-guessing game, for a price in the “low seven figures.” The deal is part of The Times’s plan to grow its subscriber base, but the company said the game will remain free for now.

Follow the money
As the midterm elections approach, both political parties have been amassing war chests. Yesterday was the deadline for the latest campaign finance disclosures, which show that Republicans are way ahead of Democrats, in part because of well-heeled business donors.
House Republican leaders’ super PAC ended 2021 with $61 million, far ahead of the Democrats’ counterpart, thanks to seven- and eight-figure donations. Among the biggest contributors were Ken Griffin and Patrick Ryan, the founder of the insurer Aon.
Big business donors have also given to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the two Democrats who have thwarted some of President Biden’s legislative agenda:
Manchin, of West Virginia, raised nearly $300,000 days after publicly opposing Biden’s social spending plan. That came from corporate PACs tied to the likes of Anthem, CVS Health and Meta; it also came from traditional Republican donors like Ken Langone and Richard LeFrak.
Sinema, of Arizona, raised $1.6 million in the fourth quarter from G.O.P. stalwarts like Langone, George Roberts of KKR and Nelson Peltz; she also took money from groups like the American Petroleum Institute. (Her grassroots donations, however, have largely dried up.)
“We tried to figure out, ‘Where did the money go?’ — and it turns out it didn’t primarily go to workers who would have lost jobs. It went to business owners and their shareholders and their creditors.”
— David Autor, a professor at M.I.T. who studied the effects of the $800 billion Paycheck Protection Program, one of the government’s most expensive pandemic relief efforts. Only about a quarter of the money spent by the program paid wages that would have otherwise been lost.

A nuclear option on Russian sanctions
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is a messaging service that connects more than 11,000 financial institutions to enable them to transfer money. The global cooperative has tried to be apolitical, but at times it has been caught up in diplomatic disputes.
The Biden administration has threatened “severe economic consequences” for Russia if it invades Ukraine. To that end, cutting Russia off from Swift is considered a nuclear option by sanctions experts.
“The Russian economy is a different beast,” said Adam Smith, a senior sanctions official in the Obama administration. “It is twice the size of any economy the U.S. has ever sanctioned.” Last week, Biden administration officials met with big American banks to discuss the market impact of sanctions on Russia, including the ramifications of cutting it off from Swift.
Swift has been used in sanctions before. In 2012, Swift expelled Iranian financial institutions, including its central bank, to comply with E.U. sanctions. In 2014, when access to Swift was discussed as part of sanctions on Russia after it annexed Crimea, Russian leaders called it a “declaration of war.”

How would Russia respond? Russia has developed an alternative payments system since 2014, reducing the threat of losing access to Swift. “It won’t be as painful for Russia as Western officials envision,” said Maria Snegovaya, a visiting scholar at George Washington University and a co-author of an Atlantic Council report on U.S. sanctions on Russia. Sanctioning Russian banks directly, especially by cutting their ability to trade in dollars, would represent a more targeted strike.

Exclusive: Carlyle to announce 2050 net-zero commitment
The private equity firm Carlyle will announce today that it will pledge to have its portfolio companies get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, DealBook is first to report. That makes Carlyle one of the first major private equity firms to join a net-zero pledge already signed by BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and other big financial institutions.
The move by Carlyle, which has more than 250 portfolio companies and nearly $300 billion in assets under management, could put pressure on rivals like Blackstone and KKR to follow suit.

Private equity firms have been holdouts on net-zero pledges. The diverse array of companies that these firms own makes it difficult to take a standardized approach. It also typically takes much longer to “decarbonize” a company than the three to five years that private equity firms tend to own their portfolio companies. But private equity is coming under pressure from pension funds, regulators and capital markets to take part in net-zero pledges.
The big question: To invest or divest? Selling carbon-intensive companies is one way to reduce a private equity portfolio’s emissions, but Carlyle’s C.E.O., Kewsong Lee, said it was “imperative that the private equity industry focus on investing, rather than divesting,” to facilitate “real progress” in the transition to cleaner energy. “We won’t invest in or finance coal-fired power generation — except if we see an opportunity to decommission those assets and repower them to lower-carbon energy sources,” said Megan Starr, Carlyle’s head of global impact.
The scope of Carlyle’s commitment: The company will report on its progress every year and by 2025 it aims for three-quarters of its portfolio companies to align with the Paris Climate Agreement. After that, it will require companies to adhere to those standards within two years of buying them. This covers so-called Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which companies can directly control, but not Scope 3 emissions, the pollution generated by a company’s suppliers and customers, which are often the most material. Carlyle’s 2050 net-zero goal does, however, include Scope 3 emissions.
What does it mean for returns? In terms of the cost to Carlyle, the firm will tackle each company by starting with investments in decarbonization that quickly make the most difference. After that, “it does get more challenging and there might be a longer payback period,” Starr said.” But because the markets now “value climate strategy so highly,” she said, the work will be worth it.

2022-02-03,"For Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla and founder of SpaceX, traveling by private jet is not such a private endeavor.
Jack Sweeney, 19, a freshman at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, has been tracking a Gulfstream G650ER that he identified as Mr. Musk’s private jet and posting maps of its whereabouts on a popular Twitter account since June 2020.
Mr. Musk is not the only famous person being followed by the pesky wingman, who has thwarted efforts by Mr. Musk and others to cloak their movements on aircraft-tracking applications and websites.
The nosy can also keep up with Drake, Mark Cuban, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates on Mr. Sweeney’s other accounts.

Mr. Sweeney said on Wednesday that he was able to track them using data from their plane’s transponders — a public record that includes the aircraft’s altitude, latitude and longitude and heading — an algorithm and a bot that he created.
But Mr. Musk was rather vexed by the flight-tracking gambit, Mr. Sweeney recalled in an interview, saying that he received a direct message on Nov. 30 from the billionaire on Twitter asking him to deactivate the account @ElonJet.
“I go like, Oh my gosh, Elon Musk just DM’d me: ‘Can you take this down? It’s a security risk,’” Mr. Sweeney said. “Then he offered me $5,000 to take it down and help him make it slightly harder for ‘crazy people to track me.’”
Mr. Sweeney provided screenshots of the exchange to The New York Times, which was not able to independently verify its authenticity.
Mr. Musk did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on Wednesday, including to say whether he sent the messages.

The exchange highlighted the tension between open public records and privacy — and it was not the first time famous people had been tracked. Journalists have used flight-tracking apps to follow politicians ahead of vice-presidential selections. Investors use them to shadow chief executives to get wind of corporate mergers. Sports fans have used them to track coaching candidates of their favorite teams.
Mr. Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, declined to comment on Wednesday. Representatives for Mr. Bezos, the Amazon founder; Mr. Gates, one of Microsoft’s founders; and Drake, the hip-hop mogul, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington whose focus is technology and its legal implications, said on Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration required planes to transmit location data to prevent collisions and to help find lost aircraft.
“What this teenager is taking advantage of is a lack of foresight on the part of the F.A.A. that this would become a privacy problem for some people,” Professor Calo said.
Reached for comment on Wednesday, the F.A.A. said that the situation was outside the agency’s scope of authority.

Professor Calo was amused that a teenager would hear directly from Mr. Musk.
“There almost couldn’t be a greater power asymmetry between Musk and this teenager,” Professor Calo said. “This is not David and Goliath. This is like Goliath and a flea on David.”
Mr. Sweeney said that he was drifting off to sleep when his Android phone buzzed at 12:19 a.m. on Nov. 30. He had been in his dorm room, where several posters promoting SpaceX, Mr. Musk’s space exploration company, were hanging on the wall above his bed, according to a photograph shared on Mr. Sweeney’s personal Twitter account.
Mr. Sweeney made a counteroffer to Mr. Musk, according to the screenshots of the exchange, saying that he would abandon the account if Mr. Musk upped the ante to $50,000. He said that he would also accept a Tesla Model 3, an electric car that costs more than $38,000, adding that he was joking.
In the exchange, Mr. Sweeney was asked how he had been able to track Mr. Musk. He explained that he had obtained the plane’s transponder data. When told that paying to have the Twitter account shut down didn’t seem right, Mr. Sweeney made another proposal: How about an internship?
The exchange, which carried on for more than a month, went silent after Jan. 23.
Mr. Sweeney downplayed the privacy and security concerns associated with his tracking account for Mr. Musk, which has more than 305,000 followers.

“It’s a private jet so he goes right from the jet to the car,” he said, adding that he has long been fascinated by tracking planes. “I don’t think it’s that big of a concern. Some people are just interested in seeing where he goes.”
Mr. Sweeney said that he obtained the data for his aircraft-tracking accounts from the ADS-B Exchange, which describes itself on its website as the world’s largest source of unfiltered flight data.
Dan Streufert, the founder of ADSBexchange.com L.L.C., said in an email on Wednesday that anyone with basic electronics could obtain the signals from aircraft that broadcast their locations. The information is also available by listening to air traffic controllers, he added.
“However, it is important to note our website tracks aircraft, not individuals,” Mr. Streufert said. “We cannot say who is or is not on the plane. Mr. Musk’s companies own and operate many aircraft — this is only one of them. Mr. Musk may find Mr. Sweeney’s activities annoying, similar to paparazzi, however, this information is already public from a myriad of sources.”
Professor Calo said that as long as Mr. Sweeney did not create the flight-tracking accounts to demand money from Mr. Musk and others, it would be difficult to make a criminal case that it was extortion.

“You’d have to purposely create this harm and hold it over somebody,” he said.
Professor Calo said that it would be difficult for a public figure like Mr. Musk to bring a civil lawsuit against Mr. Sweeney contending that his privacy had been breached.
“So I think there would be real hurdles to try to pursue this kid, civilly,” he said.
Still, he cautioned that Mr. Sweeney could open himself up to litigation if he took it too far.
“That’s quite a ride,” he said. “He just has to proceed carefully from here.”
After Mr. Sweeney’s last message to Mr. Musk on Jan. 23, the exchange bore a certain finality.
“You can no longer send messages to this person,” an automated message from Twitter read."

2022-02-07,"SAN FRANCISCO — Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker, has ended its nearly 18-month effort to buy Arm, which licenses chip technology used in most smartphones.
Nvidia, a fast-growing company whose chips are best known for rendering images in video games, in September 2020 offered cash and stock then valued at $40 billion for Arm, making it the most expensive deal ever among chip companies. Nvidia made the offer to buy Arm from SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that has owned the British company since 2016. Nvidia’s rising stock price later sent the transaction’s value much higher, settling at about $60 billion on Monday.
But the blockbuster deal encountered setbacks that included a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit in December to block the acquisition, as well opposition from regulators in Britain.
Nvidia and SoftBank said early Tuesday they agreed to terminate the planned deal because of “significant regulatory challenges.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The end of the deal is a blow to Nvidia and its chief executive, Jensen Huang, who has driven the company’s chips into new applications, such as artificial intelligence software run by giant cloud companies. Mr. Huang argued that Arm, whose microprocessor technology is contained in more than 25 billion chips sold each year, could help give Nvidia a broader position in data centers akin to rivals like Intel.
But Qualcomm, Microsoft and others that license Arm technology argued that the deal could harm their businesses. That resonated with some regulators.
In its lawsuit to block the deal, the F.T.C. asserted that Nvidia, which also licenses Arm technology, would be able to restrict access to that technology or manipulate the price that other chip companies paid for the technology. Nvidia also could misuse confidential information those companies shared with Arm, the agency said.
Nvidia and Arm rejected those arguments. Mr. Huang has repeatedly insisted that Nvidia would keep Arm’s business model. He also said the deal would bolster innovation, as Nvidia’s financial resources would allow Arm to develop more technology more quickly.
Nvidia also proposed remedies to allay regulator concerns. Those included setting up a wholly separate licensing entity, as well as licensing Arm-based intellectual property developed by Nvidia to all companies on a nondiscriminatory basis.

“There is no evidence that a combined Nvidia and Arm would have either the ability or the incentive to harm competition,” lawyers for Nvidia, SoftBank and Arm argued in a response to the F.T.C. complaint.
Whoever might have prevailed in court, the lengthy delays in closing the deal posed problems for Arm and SoftBank. SoftBank had paid $32 billion for Arm in 2016, as an audacious bet by its chief, Masayoshi Son, on a global rise in internet-connected devices, and was looking to reap gains from the deal.
SoftBank now plans to take Arm public, sometime in the fiscal year starting in March. Arm said Simon Segars, its chief executive, decided to step down after 30 years at the company in view of the demands of taking it public. He is being succeeded by Rene Haas, a longtime senior executive.
“Our business has never been better,” Mr. Haas said in an interview, but he added that the uncertainty about the deal was not helpful. “It’s very clear that the regulatory climate has gotten more challenging.”
Mr. Huang of Nvidia vowed to remain a user of Arm technology. “Though we won’t be one company, we will partner closely with Arm,” he said in a statement.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The end of the deal is not a surprise. Many Wall Street analysts had concluded after the F.T.C. suit that Arm would have to make other plans. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Nvidia was likely to abandon the effort. The Financial Times reported earlier on Monday that the transaction was being canceled.
“It feels safe to say that virtually no one in the investment community has expected it to close anyway,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a research note last month.
He suggested that Nvidia should be able to continue its recent momentum in the data center market. The company has also been propelled by strong chip demand associated with A.I., video games, assisted driving and Bitcoin mining.
Arm first went public in 1998 and remained publicly held until the SoftBank acquisition. Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research, wrote early this month that Arm should be able to successfully go public again, at a valuation in the range of $45 billion."

Banking on it
Big banks are responding to the “Great Resignation” by writing big checks. To keep workers from leaving, Wall Street institutions have been raising pay and bonuses for everyone from senior executives to junior bankers. The thing is, it may not be enough, The Times’s Lananh Nguyen reports.
Job churn at the country’s biggest banks is accelerating, fueled by a war for finance talent, both inside and outside the industry, and burnout from working punishingly long hours during the pandemic. “I was just so tired of it. It wasn’t making me happy,” said Amy Wu Stratton, who left Citi in June, even though it was her most lucrative year after almost 16 years in banking. “The pandemic slowed me down and made me take stock.”
The six biggest banks collectively spent nearly $178 billion on compensation last year, up 12 percent from the year before. Steven Eckhaus, a Wall Street employment lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery, said he had negotiated a handful of eight-figure pay packages on behalf of top bankers in the past few months, including a $20 million signing bonus for a client after a four-month bidding war. At the other end of the scale, the typical base pay for recent graduates in their first or second year on Wall Street has reached $100,000, from about $85,000, and that’s before bonuses.
But “money doesn’t always make you happy,” said Alan Johnson of Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consultancy. Some bankers are moving elsewhere in finance, to smaller banks where they can have more control over their hours or to fast-growing fintech and crypto firms. Others are leaving finance altogether. Stratton left Citi to start a website for Asian women who are focused on careers and social impact. “I was so happy to get out of that thinking of always having more and more,” she said.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The U.S. trade deficit soars. The deficit rose 27 percent last year, to nearly $860 billion. The reason: Americans bought mountains of imported goods, while the U.S. suffered a drop in demand for its services, particularly with foreigners spending far less on tourism and education.
Americans take on more debt. Borrowing rose at the fastest pace since before the financial crisis, driven by purchases of homes and cars, according to economists at the New York Fed. But they said that they weren’t too concerned, given the overall rise in wealth during the pandemic.
Johnson & Johnson pauses production of its Covid vaccine. The company quietly shut down the only plant that produces the shot and manufactured another, potentially more lucrative vaccine unrelated to the coronavirus, The Times reports. While the halt is expected to be temporary, it came after J.&J. had already fallen behind on deliveries to poorer countries.
A bipartisan effort to ban congressional stock trading emerges. Senators Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, will propose preventing lawmakers and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks, according to Axios.

Our notes on Peloton
Peloton’s major shake-up yesterday made waves, not least in the connected fitness company’s share price, which rose 25 percent, regaining some — but not nearly all — of its decline over the past year. We shared our initial thoughts about the moves in yesterday’s newsletter, and then spent the day talking with sources about what happens next. Here’s what we learned:
On Barry McCarthy. The appeal of Peloton’s new C.E.O., who was formerly the finance chief of Spotify and Netflix, is clear: He knows how to run a subscription business. And having worked alongside the founders of those companies, McCarthy knows how to do the same with Peloton’s co-founder, John Foley, who in shifting to executive chairman from C.E.O. won’t be going far.
Image
On turning around the business. Peloton is looking to save $800 million annually by cutting costs on staff, marketing, real estate and more. It also faces a challenge in moving mounting inventory, which reflects slowing demand for its bikes and treadmills. But when — or if — Peloton can reduce its losses, it will need a strategy beyond emergency resuscitation. Could that include partnerships? Or increasing the price of its streaming plans?

On those takeover rumors. We quizzed Wall Street sources on what McCarthy’s hiring meant for a potential sale, as the activist investor Blackwells Capital has urged. Overwhelmingly, the answer was that hiring someone like McCarthy signals that there isn’t an immediate plan to sell the company. Peloton may still do a deal, but as a source told DealBook: “It buys them some time.”
The couple behind the crypto heist
The Justice Department yesterday said it had seized over $3.6 billion worth of stolen Bitcoin and arrested a married couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, accused of laundering the crypto. It’s a case full of big numbers — and other eye-catching details.
The stash is the department’s largest financial seizure ever. About 119,754 Bitcoin was stolen in 2016 from the Bitfinex exchange, according to prosecutors. (It was worth $71 million at the time of the heist and is now valued at over $4.5 billion.) Law enforcement officials recovered 94,636 Bitcoin, valued at more than $3.6 billion, from a wallet belonging to Lichtenstein.
The couple now face charges of money laundering. The pair, who describe themselves as entrepreneurs, led a flashy life. Morgan in particular has built up a outsized public profile, writing for Forbes and Inc. and rapping under the name Razzlekhan, the self-described “crocodile of Wall Street.” (Here are some of her music videos.) They posted online often and publicly about crypto: “The amount of spam I’m getting about sketchy crypto get rich stuff really makes me feel like this bubble is gonna pop soon!” Morgan tweeted in December.

Are unions on the rise?
Headlines suggest that the unionization movement in the U.S. seems to be gaining momentum. It certainly has support from the Biden administration, which issued a report this week outlining dozens of steps it will take to promote union membership. Here are some of the recent union developments making news:
Congressional staff members started a unionization effort last week,  noting that they are employed by politicians who say they support the labor movement. Before their workers can unionize, however, House members must pass a resolution allowing it. Representative Andy Levin, Democrat of Michigan, plans to do that this week. President Biden supports the union drive, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said yesterday.
Starbucks workers in California this week joined their counterparts in more than 50 locations in 19 states, pushing for union elections after the first company-owned store unionized in Buffalo, N.Y. at the end of last year. Yesterday, the company fired several employees in Memphis who were seeking to unionize their store, for what the company said were violations of safety and security policies.
Amazon faces another union vote at a warehouse in Alabama, after the National Labor Relations Board threw out the results, citing misconduct by the company. A rerun of the vote started last week, and workers at a Staten Island warehouse also recently collected enough signatures to warrant a vote.
Media companies are making news for workers’ unionization drives (including at The New York Times). One of the latest is The Financial Times’s U.S. newsroom.
Image
But taking a step back, union membership is on the decline, to just above 10 percent of the U.S. work force last year, half the share of the early 1980s. In absolute terms, union rolls have lost about four million members over that period.

What’s in a bank?
Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s nominee to lead bank supervision at the Fed, faces stiff resistance from Republicans based on her progressive positions and on apparent ethical questions that some believe are really intended to push one state’s cryptocurrency agenda.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Republicans questioned Raskin’s contacts with the Kansas City Fed. Raskin, a former Fed governor, joined the board of a fintech company that was approved for a Fed “master account,” and faced questions about these dealings at her confirmation hearing. The Kansas City Fed responded on Monday, saying communication with company directors is “routine.” But Senator Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, said yesterday that the real problem was that a “connected non-bank” secured Fed approval while requests from “actual banks” in her state “have been stonewalled.” Wyoming created the Special Purpose Depository Institution, or SPDI (pronounced “speedy”), a new kind of financial institution that handles digital assets.
It all depends on how you define “bank.” Lee Reiners, a Duke University law school fintech expert and a former New York Fed lawyer, told DealBook that Lummis’s “outlandish accusations” are actually part of a wider effort to pressure the Fed into “letting lightly regulated crypto companies into the national payment system.” Lummis characterizes Wyoming’s applicants for Fed access as “banks,” but Reiners says that SPDIs do not meet the definition of banks under the current rules. (Lummis declined to comment when contacted by DealBook.)
“We have to think about the broader safety and soundness implications,” the Fed chair, Jay Powell, said at his renomination hearing last month in response to Lummis’s questions about granting SPDIs access to Fed master accounts. There are “good arguments” in favor, Powell said, but it would be “hugely precedential, which is why I’m taking my time.”
All five of Biden’s Fed nominees, including Raskin, are set for a vote by the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 15. Yesterday, in a letter, 20 high-profile economists urged Senate leaders to confirm the nominees.

The job market has been affected by the pandemic and other factors.

Pay vs. prices
This morning, the government will report inflation data for January. Economists expect that prices continued to climb at the fastest pace in 40 years. But how much workers feel the effects of inflation depends on whether wages, which have also been growing fast, can keep pace with rising prices. DealBook turned to Ben Casselman, an economics reporter at The Times, for his thoughts. Here’s what he said:
First, there’s almost no question that wages, in the aggregate, have risen less than inflation over the past year. Over the full pandemic, real wages — meaning after inflation — are probably up, but below their prepandemic trend.
Second, it’s totally possible to argue that wage growth will remain strong even if inflation moderates, leading to real gains for workers. There are two flavors of that argument:
In one version, the pandemic has spurred productivity-enhancing investments. In addition, it’s possible that there has been a composition shift in the economy toward more high-productivity sectors. And some of those shifts could be permanent, even after the pandemic. That means, for example, more Zoom meetings and less business travel, which could allow for more output with fewer hours, and hence faster real wage growth.
The other possibility is that inflation and wages are being driven, largely, by different forces right now. Inflation is mostly about elevated spending, especially on goods, running into supply-chain disruptions. Wages are being driven by labor shortages, which give workers more bargaining power. Those two forces have some of the same underlying causes — like excess savings allowing people to sit out of the labor market and spend more — but they’re sufficiently distinct that you could imagine inflation abating while wage pressures remain strong.
Those are two very different stories. One is about the pie growing larger; the other is about workers getting a bigger share of the pie. (Remember, labor’s share of national income — that is, the amount of G.D.P. that gets paid out to workers — has been falling for decades, so there’s plenty of room for it to rise.) Then again, it’s also possible that wages will continue to lag behind inflation, or at least won’t outpace it, leaving workers treading water, at best.

Disney+ gains ground on Netflix. Disney said its streaming service hit 130 million subscribers by year end, surpassing expectations.

Leonard Green joins the hunt for Kohl’s. The private equity firm has expressed its interest in bidding for the retailer, two people familiar with the matter told DealBook. The firm may not submit an offer, but its interest is notable, given its expertise in retail. (Leonard Green declined to comment.) Kohl’s has said that it was working with PJT Partners and Goldman Sachs to field interest, after takeover approaches from the private equity firm Sycamore and a consortium backed by Starboard Value — which the retailer has rejected as too low.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi signals an openness to banning lawmakers’ stock trades. As bipartisan support for the ban grows, even Pelosi — whose husband’s lucrative trades have drawn criticism — suggested she may be open to such measures. One steadfast opponent is Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, who violated congressional reporting rules on disclosing trades 132 times last year.
Tech stocks show mixed fortunes. Twitter said today that its fourth-quarter revenue grew more slowly than analysts expected and that it would report a loss in the current quarter. Investors have been worried about a slide in its business, with one prominent shareholder, the fund manager Cathie Wood, selling down her holdings recently. Meanwhile, Uber’s earnings highlighted rising revenue and passenger numbers as signs of a comeback in its core ride-hailing business.

Microsoft’s charm offensive
Microsoft laid out its pitch to regulators in Washington yesterday as it sought approval for its $70 billion deal to buy the video game maker Activision. The company is positioning itself as the friendly face of Big Tech, drawing distinctions with Google, Apple and Amazon, which have attracted the ire of lawmakers and regulators for their market power.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Microsoft also has to convince investors that the deal can pass regulatory muster: Activision’s shares are trading at $81.50, far below the $95 price Microsoft has offered, implying that there are some doubts that the deal will get done.
Microsoft announced an 11-point pledge for a “principled approach to app stores.” It promised not to give preferential treatment to its own games in its app stores and said it would not force developers to use its payment system to process in-app payments (the center of the legal fight between Apple and Epic Games). If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s what the Open App Markets Act, which recently passed the Senate, calls on Apple and Google to do.
Other tech giants have bristled at Microsoft’s strategy. Google’s head of global affairs has criticized Microsoft for supporting an act targeting its competitors, while not applying the same restrictions on its Xbox store. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said the company was “committed” to applying the promises on preferential treatment and payments to the Xbox store “over time.”

Microsoft also needs to convince regulators outside of Washington. Microsoft said yesterday it would need approval from 17 governments to get the Activision deal done. “We want to be clear with regulators and with the public that if this acquisition is approved, they can count on Microsoft to adapt to the rules that are emerging,” Smith said.
In other news, Discovery and AT&T cleared a significant regulatory hurdle to their plan to merge into one of the biggest media companies in the country, saying that the combination “satisfied the closing condition” of an antitrust review by the Justice Department.
“Smaller cases can make big law, and this could be one of those cases.”

The deal tests new thinking in antitrust that says the government should move quickly to stop bigger companies from buying fledgling innovators.

The S.E.C. had a busy day
The S.E.C. wants to make private equity a bit less private, advancing a proposal for new rules to shed more light on the roughly $18 trillion industry. At a meeting of S.E.C. commissioners yesterday, the agency also proposed shortening settlement time for trades and requiring more disclosures of cybersecurity policies and episodes. These rules are now put out for public comment, where they could be altered based on feedback (and lobbying) before being put to a final vote, a process that could take all year to finalize.
The private equity industry is likely to resist the rules on more transparency. If the proposals are approved, private equity firms and hedge funds would have to provide more information to investors, including quarterly statements detailing performance, fees and expenses. The funds would also be subject to more record-keeping and audits, limits on giving particular investors preferential treatment, and prohibitions on charging certain fees and expenses to a fund. (Last month, the S.E.C. also proposed rules that would require private funds to share more information about their investments confidentially with regulators.)
Drew Maloney of the American Investment Council, a trade group that represents private equity, said that “these new regulations are unnecessary and will not strengthen pension returns or help companies innovate and compete in a global marketplace.”
Steve Nelson of Institutional Limited Partners Association, a trade group representing pension funds and other investors, said the rules could “help address the increased conflict of interest” in the private equity industry.
Speeding up settlement times would be a stock market makeover. The S.E.C.’s plan would shorten the time it takes to complete a stock trade, cutting the current two-day period in half. In a report on the meme-stock frenzy last year, the agency said that speeding up settlement could reduce liquidity demands that clearinghouses put on brokers, which the online broker Robinhood said forced it to limit trading in some stocks when they were in high demand.
Better cybersecurity practices would reduce risks and bolster investor confidence, the agency said. Proposed new rules for investment companies would require written cybersecurity policies and procedures, record-keeping and reporting of cybersecurity episodes. “Cyber incidents, unfortunately, happen a lot,” Gary Gensler, the S.E.C. chair, said in a statement.

2022-02-11,"Cisco Systems, the technology conglomerate, has held discussions with the software company Splunk about buying it, although no deal is currently on the table, two people familiar with the matter told The New York Times on Friday.
A deal may not happen at all, but if talks resume, Cisco could pay more than $20 billion for Splunk, one of the people said.
Splunk, whose stock price has fallen by 30 percent since its chief executive, Doug Merritt, unexpectedly stepped down in November, has a market capitalization of around $18 billion. Cisco’s market capitalization is $227 billion.
The people requested anonymity because the information is confidential. Cisco did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for Splunk said the company did not comment on rumors or speculation. The Wall Street Journal reported the potential deal earlier on Friday.

Splunk — named after spelunking, the sport of cave exploring — mines data for insights, including security threats, a business that grew in importance as the coronavirus pandemic quickly forced many workers online. It has more recently sought to shift toward cloud computing and catch up with its competitors, like Datadog, that started their business in the cloud. In June, the private-equity firm Silver Lake invested $1 billion in Splunk to help with that transition.
Cisco is known as a serial acquirer, effectively using acquisitions as a complement to research and development. Its past deals include Acacia, a maker of optical network components; Luxtera, a semiconductor company; and ThousandEyes, a cloud intelligence company. Its chief executive, Chuck Robbins, told analysts in December that Cisco would continue to look for acquisitions in security.
Technology has been a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions activity over the past year, as soaring stock prices have left companies flush with cash. Microsoft said last month that it was planning to acquire the video game company Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion, and Salesforce acquired the workplace software company Slack last year for $27.7 billion."

What’s Up? (Feb. 6-12)
Peloton Hits a Steep Hill
Early in the pandemic, with gyms closed and people stuck at home, demand for Peloton’s bikes and virtual classes soared. So did its share price. But sales growth has slowed as gyms and fitness studios reopened. The company’s outlook has not been helped by a recall of its treadmills over safety concerns and fictional characters suffering heart attacks while riding its bikes in not just one, but two popular television shows. Peloton has been forced to hit the brakes, halting production of its bikes and treadmills, scratching plans for a new factory in Ohio and on Tuesday announcing that it would lay off 2,800 workers, about 20 percent of its work force. The company’s founder, John Foley, said he would step down as chief executive and become executive chairman. Barry McCarthy, a former chief financial officer of Spotify, was named chief executive and president.
Inflation Sticks
Speaking of hills, prices continued their steep upward trajectory in January, according to new numbers released by the Department of Labor on Thursday. The Consumer Price Index, a key measure of inflation, showed that prices have climbed 7.5 percent over the past year. While increases in car prices, which were mostly because of pandemic supply chain issues, moderated somewhat, the cost of food, rent, electricity and other services continued to rise, suggesting that there are more than just pandemic factors at play. That could put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cool the economy. Investors now expect the Fed to raise interest rates by half a point in March, rather than its standard quarter-point increase.
Big Deals Under Review
The Biden administration has made cracking down on corporate consolidation a priority, an effort that started last year with hiring the most aggressive antitrust enforcement team in decades. Regulators’ concerns came into play in several big deals last week. On Monday, the Silicon Valley chip maker Nvidia announced that it would end its efforts to buy Arm, which licenses chip technology, because of “significant regulatory challenges.” The same day, Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines announced plans to merge, a deal that would create the fifth-largest airline by market share and could also face opposition from regulators. (The Justice Department sued to prevent American Airlines and JetBlue Airways from merging last year.) Microsoft also began lobbying for approval of its $70 billion deal to buy the video game company Activision Blizzard, which would be the largest deal in its history, by promising to keep Activision franchises like Call of Duty available on other platforms and to not require game makers to use its payment systems. And Discovery and AT&T cleared a significant regulatory hurdle on Wednesday in their deal to combine Discovery and WarnerMedia, which would create one of the biggest media companies in the United States.

The Ripple Effects of Trucker Protests
Protests by truckers angry about vaccination requirements have already taken an economic toll that could spread in the coming days and weeks. The protests have blocked major border crossings between Canada and the United States, including main routes for steel, aluminum and other car parts needed by factories in both countries. In response, Toyota, Ford Motors and Honda have cut production at factories in Michigan and Ontario. The parts shortages will first affect smaller auto parts suppliers, independent truckers and workers whose hours have been cut with production, which could also affect communities heavily dependent on the auto industry as workers spend less on goods and services. “If it stretches on for weeks, it could be catastrophic,” said Peter Nagle, an analyst at the research firm IHS Markit who covers the car industry.
Masks Come Off
The governors of New York, Rhode Island, and Illinois announced an end to their statewide indoor mask mandates on Wednesday, adding to a growing list of city and state governments that have eased pandemic rules in recent weeks. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendation that people wear masks in schools and public indoor spaces in places where the virus is surging. As a patchwork of mandates expire, it will be left to businesses previously covered by the rules to decide for themselves whether to require masks.

The company has long said it would embrace a hybrid work environment, with most employees able to work from home up to 50 percent of the time. In a Monday morning blog post focused on its headquarters near Seattle, Chris Capossela, an executive, said that starting Feb. 28, “employees will have 30 days to make adjustments to their routines and adopt the working preferences they’ve agreed upon with their managers.”
Mr. Capossela cited the high vaccination rates in King County, where most employees live, and declining hospitalizations and deaths in the state as factors in the decision. Residents in King County, which includes Seattle, are among the most vaccinated in the country, with more than 91 percent of those who are 5 or older having received at least one shot.
While the announcement was focused on the company’s home state, where most of Microsoft’s employees are based, Mr. Capossela said the company’s Bay Area sites “will fully open on Feb. 28, and we anticipate many of our other U.S. locations will follow suit as conditions allow.”

A $5.7 billion mystery
In an inconspicuous fashion — via a regulatory filing with the S.E.C. — Elon Musk disclosed that he gave nearly $6 billion worth of Tesla shares to charity last year, instantly propelling him into the upper ranks of philanthropic donors. But the document gave little information about where the Tesla C.E.O. directed his wealth.
Musk donated just over five million shares in November, according to the filing. Based on the average price of Tesla shares on the days he sold, that is worth roughly $5.7 billion. That would make him the second-biggest donor last year, behind only Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates and their $15 billion in giving, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
The gift came as Musk sold many more billions in stock. He sold more than $16 billion worth of shares in November and December, much of which was meant to cover tax obligations after exercising stock options. At the time, Musk tweeted that he would be likely to pay over $11 billion in taxes, one of the biggest individual bills in U.S. history. The stock donation could be useful in defraying that bill.
The question is where those shares went. The donation came as Musk argued with populist lawmakers like the senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren about wealth inequality and taxes. Several observers noted that weeks before his donation, Musk tweeted that he would give $6 billion if the U.N. could prove that money could help solve world hunger. Days afterward, the U.N.’s World Food Program outlined how it would spend $6.6 billion to help avert famine.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Canada declares a national emergency to end trucker protests. The move by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — which lets the government take actions like freezing protesters’ bank accounts — comes as antigovernment demonstrations continue to paralyze Ottawa. Meanwhile, North American automakers restarted production after the Canadian authorities cleared protesters from a key trade route to the U.S.
Donald Trump’s accounting firm cuts ties and retracts financial statements. In a court filing, Mazars USA said it could no longer stand behind a decades’ worth of work prepared for the former president. The statements are at the center of two law enforcement investigations into whether Trump exaggerated the value of his properties to defraud lenders.
Texas sues Meta over facial recognition data. The lawsuit accuses Facebook’s parent company of collecting biometric data for more than a decade without users’ informed consent. The action comes a year after Facebook settled a similar lawsuit in Illinois for $650 million; Texas is seeking “billions” in damages.

Tracing the markets’ latest swings
Stock futures are up sharply this morning, after falling for a third day yesterday. What’s weighing on investors’ minds? We have two ideas.
Glimmers of hope for the Ukraine crisis. Russia’s top diplomat endorsed more discussions with the West to avert a potential invasion, while announcing the end of some large-scale military “drills” near the Ukraine border. The news not only sent Dow futures up 400 points, but also led to a drop in oil prices.

But Western and Ukrainian officials appeared to be skeptical that the invasion threat has passed: “When we see the withdrawal, we will believe in de-escalation,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, told reporters. And the lower house of Russia’s Parliament voted today to request that President Vladimir Putin recognize the Russian-backed separatist territories in Ukraine’s east as independent states, effectively abandoning a 2015 peace treaty.

The business costs of a figure skating scandal
Arbitrators cleared the Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva to continue competing in the Beijing Olympics, despite having failed a doping test in December, though Olympics officials will withhold medals in any event where she places in the top three until her case is resolved. The stunning turn of events has caused an uproar, so DealBook has taken a look at the potential financial impact.
The skaters: Valieva is likely to finish in the top three in any event in which she participates, meaning that there probably won’t be any medal ceremony. That would deprive athletes of a prime publicity opportunity from which to secure lucrative sponsorship deals. The U.S. skater Adam Rippon, who shot to fame after his Olympics feats in 2018, was among those who decried the move: “The ladies event tomorrow is a complete joke,” he tweeted yesterday.
Figure skating: Skaters and their families openly worried that the incident could tarnish the sport, which has already suffered a decline in viewership since the 2002 Olympic judging scandal. There’s precedent for such concerns: Revelations of widespread doping led to T-Mobile withdrawing its sponsorship of professional cycling in 2007.
Viewership: Research by Jeffrey Cisyk, an associate principal at Charles River Associates, found that steroid suspensions in baseball led to a drop in attendance of at least 8 percent. Such fan boycotts have tended to be fleeting, lasting around 30 days — but the Beijing Olympics have only about a week to go, and women’s figure skating, one of its marquee events, starts today. NBC is already suffering record low ratings for this year’s games, so it may be hoping that the Valieva incident will instead draw in the curious, as the Tonya Harding scandal did.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Olympics itself. Sponsors of this year’s Games have already been unusually silent about their ties to the event amid criticism of Beijing’s human rights record, and Russian athletes were already competing under an independent banner because of another doping scandal. The Valieva affair might mean that “some corporations will question whether the Olympics still align with its core values,” Cisyk told DealBook. Could that lead to difficulty recruiting future host cities, especially given the huge costs of holding the games?

2022-02-16,"The stock market has lately soured on the technology industry. Stock prices of many of the largest companies are down this year, some slightly — shares of Apple and Google have fallen more than 6 percent — and some stupendously: Facebook's parent company, Meta, and Netflix have lost about a third of their value since the New Year. Because surging tech stocks drove a big part of the stock market’s rise in 2021, their decline has contributed much to the market’s fall. The S & P 500 is down by about 7 percent in 2022.
It’s obvious why investors are spooked. Omicron, inflation, likely interest rate hikes, a possible war in Europe, Canadians acting very un-Canadianly — unpredictable forces have taken hold of the global economy, so it’s not unreasonable to expect trouble ahead for some of the largest companies in the world.
But in the last few weeks, as corporations announced their financial performance for the final months of 2021, I’ve found it hard to focus on what might now go wrong for the tech industry.
Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft — the four American companies now worth more than a trillion dollars each (actually, Microsoft is above $2 trillion, and Apple nearly $3 trillion) — reported enviable growth in 2021. Even Facebook’s disappointing earnings were relative: The company’s profits grew by 35 percent in 2021, down from nearly 60 percent growth in 2020.

So the much bigger story is that after all that has gone right during the pandemic for the largest companies in tech, they now seem poised to expand their reach and influence over the rest of the economy, rather than relinquish it.

Perhaps it’s not very surprising that the largest tech companies did really well during a pandemic that had a lot of us spending lots more time with technology. Yet the scale of their growth is staggering.
As Chaim Gartenberg of The Verge pointed out, Apple’s revenue grew by more than $90 billion in 2021, about a third more than its revenue in 2020 — and this despite a global shortage of computer chips. Amazon’s sales in 2021 were 67 percent larger than in 2019, the year before the pandemic; Google’s 2021 revenue was nearly 60 percent greater than in 2019.
I’ve worn down my thesaurus looking for superlatives to underline how gobsmacking these numbers are. These were already among the largest corporations ever to have existed; in 2018, Apple became the first American company to reach a trillion-dollar market valuation. Companies of that size are just not supposed to grow as quickly as they have. For years, pundits have been predicting that tech giants would eventually run up against the so-called “law of large numbers.” Yet Big Tech keeps breaking the law.
What’s driving tech giants’ stupefying growth? It’s not just that the pandemic drove a lot more usage of tech. A bigger deal, I think, is that the pandemic illustrated how much room there still is in our lives for adding even more tech — for our screens to become the primary portal through which a handful of companies capture a slice of everything we do.

Consider, for instance, Apple’s “services” business — a division that includes, among other things, its App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud and its music and TV subscription plans. Traditionally Apple has made a huge amount of money from selling hardware. But iPhone sales have gone up and down over the past half decade, which makes sense; eventually everyone who wants an iPhone will have an iPhone, and with each new iPhone only slightly better than the last, people will have fewer reasons to upgrade. Indeed, iPhone sales in Apple’s holiday quarter in 2021 grew by 9 percent over 2020 — solid, but nothing like the growth Apple once saw with the iPhone.
And so Apple has increasingly turned to subscriptions and other online services for growth — essentially a way to grow not just by selling more iPhones, but by getting more money from each iPhone user. The plan is working spectacularly well. Apple reported that during 2020 its App Store billing and sales revenue grew by 24 percent over the previous year. Luca Maestri, Apple’s finance chief, told investors last month that the company now has 785 million paying subscribers to its various offerings — a number that grew by 165 million in the past year. For some perspective: Netflix has about 222 million subscribers in total.
You see a similar trend across the industry — Big Tech’s not just getting more customers for its traditional businesses, but is expanding its ancillary businesses in ways that seem impossible. Amazon, for example, is not just an indomitable retailer and the largest cloud services provider (its Amazon Web Services cloud business now has a $71 billion annual revenue run rate). The company also disclosed that its advertising business generated $31 billion in revenue in 2021, while Microsoft said its ad revenue exceeded $10 billion. Remember that ads are, in the scheme of things, a small part of the business for both companies — Amazon’s $31 billion ad business is not even 10 percent of its annual revenue. And yet it dwarfs companies whose entire business is mainly ads — Snap, for example, which had $4 billion in revenue in 2021, or Pinterest, which sold less than $2.6 billion in ads.
Dan Ives and John Katsingris, analysts at the investment firm Wedbush Securities, wrote in a recent report that what we are seeing now is only the beginning of a long-term explosion in tech earnings. They estimated that companies would spend a trillion dollars on cloud services over the coming years, meaning that there is a lot more room for tech companies to keep growing and growing and growing. Apple’s services business alone could be worth $1.5 trillion, Ives has estimated. He and other pundits have called the coming investment boom in tech the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.”
That sounds grandiose. And yet it’s hard to see what stands in Big Tech’s way. Lawmakers and regulators have expressed alarm over tech behemoths’ market power, but with the midterm election looming and Republicans and Democrats still at odds over what exactly to do to curb tech giants’ power, the window for new antimonopoly policy might be shrinking.

Stocks slid on Thursday, extending a volatile stretch of trading brought on by uncertainty about inflation, rising interest rates and the potential for war in Europe.
The S&P 500 fell 2.1 percent, dropping into negative territory for the week, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.9 percent.

Tesla, one of the largest companies in the S&P 500, dropped 5.1 percent. The main auto-safety regulator in the United States said it was investigating reports from Tesla’s customers of “phantom braking” when they were using their vehicles’ driver-assistance system.
Shares of banks also fell, with Morgan Stanley dropping 5 percent and Wells Fargo losing 3.4 percent.
The prospect that President Vladimir V. Putin will order a Russian invasion of Ukraine has weighed on global markets. On Tuesday, the stock market rose after Russian officials announced a partial troop withdrawal from the Ukrainian border. But President Biden said on Thursday that the possibility of an invasion remained “very high,” and shelling between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists spiked, raising concerns that the conflict was heating up.

2022-02-18,"On the night of the Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2017, James Pearse Connelly was nominated for outstanding production design for his work on two shows: “Bill Nye Saves the World” and “The Voice.” He did not win for either. But Walter Wachter likes to say that Mr. Connelly ultimately won something better.
It was at the award ceremony, held at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, where Mr. Connelly first met Mr. Wachter, a production manager of original series at Netflix. The two had a brief exchange after being introduced by Jonathan Mussman, Mr. Wachter’s boss at Netflix, whom Mr. Connelly also knew.
Though their conversation was short, Mr. Wachter, dressed to stand out in white patent leather Oxford shoes and a matching white bow tie, made a lasting impression on Mr. Connelly, who had brought his mother as his date that evening.
A few days later, Mr. Connelly sent a Facebook message to Mr. Mussman asking him about, as Mr. Connelly recalled, “the cute guy with the white bow tie and white shoes.” Mr. Mussman happened to be in a meeting with Mr. Wachter when the message came through, and he showed it to him.

“We went deep on our first date, with our hearts and minds wide open,” said Mr. Connelly.
Both men grew up in New Jersey — Mr. Connelly, 41, is from Leonardo, and Mr. Wachter, 32, from Mount Laurel — and moved to Los Angeles to work in television.
Mr. Connelly, who graduated from Rutgers University, is the older of two children of Brian Connelly, an architect, and Mary Ellen Connelly, an art teacher, who are divorced. A production designer, he won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2009 for his work on the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards and, in 2011, started his own production design company, JP Connelly, in Los Angeles.
In 2020, Mr. Connelly won a Daytime Emmy Award for his work on “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” He has also appeared on the HBO Max reality competition show “Craftopia,” serving as a guest judge in its first season and a resident judge in its second.

Mr. Wachter, who goes by Wallie, graduated from Boston University and, before joining Netflix in 2016, worked as the executive assistant to the vice president of production at HBO. He is the youngest of four sons of Walter Wachter, a civil engineer, and Catherine Wachter, a homemaker who died in April 2017.
At the time of their first date, Mr. Wachter was still reeling from the loss of his mother months earlier. Mr. Connelly had recently come out of a difficult five-year relationship. Both men had dated enough in Hollywood to feel the perception that someone was interested in him because of where he worked or who he knew.
That evening, when Mr. Connelly described his mother’s belief that love is all about giving, without the expectation of something in return, it resonated for Mr. Wachter.
“I immediately knew I wanted to invest my time and energy into this,” said Mr. Wachter.
From then, other early milestones in their relationship included a date at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, where they debated whether to post their first selfie together (they did), and the day Mr. Wachter met Mr. Connelly’s French bulldog, Eleanor.
“We definitely had a certain communication magic between us, whether we were talking or texting,” said Mr. Connelly.
Soon, Mr. Wachter began staying over at Mr. Connelly’s place more and more. By November 2017, without any real discussion, he had moved in. While both wanted children, they had differing opinions about marriage.

Mr. Connelly came of age at a time when same-sex marriage was not yet legal, and he hadn’t made it a priority. By the time Mr. Wachter came out in 2008, he said, same-sex marriage seemed more of a possibility — Massachusetts had legalized it years earlier and Connecticut did that year — and he wanted children within the framework of marriage.
Eventually, Mr. Connelly came to understand Mr. Wachter’s viewpoint and, in the coming years, they would begin looking for an egg donor and a surrogate for a baby, a process that remains ongoing.
As for an engagement, Mr. Wachter said that while Mr. Connelly “was warming up to the idea of marriage, he wasn’t going to be the one to propose. He needed a push from me.”

Ahead of a trip to Japan that the couple took at the end 2019, Mr. Wachter went shopping for a ring. On their third day there, as the couple was waiting for a boat to collect them from their hotel on the Katsura River in Kyoto, Mr. Wachter dropped to one knee, surprising Mr. Connelly, who was preoccupied with creating Instagram stories.
Being proposed to was “an amazing gift,” Mr. Connelly said. “I was blown away and super surprised at how emotional it was.”

Afterward, he wanted to propose to Mr. Wachter in return. But the pandemic, which set in soon after they returned from Japan, delayed Mr. Connelly’s plan.
In July 2020, the men drove to Northern California for a getaway to Jenner, a small town on the Sonoma Coast. By then, they had acquired another French bulldog, Rigby, who along with Eleanor, joined them for the trip. (They got yet another, Honey Pie, after Eleanor died the following year.)
While Mr. Wachter suspected a proposal was coming, he did not expect it to happen on a hike overlooking the ocean at sunset.
“They are so in sync that they can have this whole conversation through their eyes,” said Lydia Smyth Garland, a friend of both men. “They are the couple at the restaurant that people watch from afar and think, ‘Now that’s how it should be.’”
The couple had a tradition of taking an annual trip somewhere new to both of them; for their wedding, they decided to open up that tradition to include their friends and family, and chose a location of Banff, Alberta.
Although they began planning during the pandemic, they optimistically chose Jan. 2, 2021, as their wedding date. But in the coming months, it became clear that Covid would make it too difficult for that to happen.

They postponed the event by nearly a year, to Dec. 19, 2021, at the Fairmont Banff Springs. The day before Mr. Connelly and Mr. Wachter were to fly to Canada, they were hearing rumors that the country might shut its borders because of the Omicron variant. Luckily, they remained only rumors.
While the couple was prepared for the extra steps required to travel internationally during the pandemic, they didn’t think about the local stipulations for having a legal wedding in Canada until days before the event, when Ms. Garland, whom they had asked to officiate, mentioned it.

“We were so busy thinking about rugs and the color of the couches, that we never thought about the legal portion,” Mr. Connelly said. They moved forward with their celebration and made plans to legally marry in Los Angeles upon their return.
Of the 120 people they invited to Banff, because of the Omicron variant, only 65 vaccinated guests made it to the event. To the morning ceremony led by Ms. Garland, the couple wore white jackets, white shoes and no ties; for the evening reception, they changed into tuxedos with midnight-blue jackets, made to measure by Zegna.
The self-imposed pressure on Mr. Connelly to create an unforgettable backdrop for their celebration in Canada was immense, he said.

He didn’t disappoint.
“As soon as you walked into the room, you were transported to this winter wonderland,” said Amanda Zucker, a friend and guest.
Décor included 30 evergreen trees and tree stumps from the province of Alberta, as well as custom sofas, pillows and lamps of Mr. Connelly’s design that were upholstered and sewn in Toronto.
On Jan. 22., they legalized their union at the Albertson Wedding Chapel in Los Angeles, with Ms. Garland, ordained by the Universal Life Church for the occasion, officiating.
Before Ms. Garland, the couple read their own vows.
“I give of my brain to envision with you what this life, our life, could be and how we change ‘could’ to ‘is,’” said Mr. Wachter.
“You are a place where I feel safe and inspired,” said Mr. Connelly. “I want to decorate our life with rich textiles, flowers, stories and songs.”

Escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine pushed stocks lower on Tuesday, adding to turmoil this year and leaving the S&P 500 more than 10 percent below its January peak.
A drop that large is known on Wall Street as a correction. It’s the kind of big, round number that crystallizes the view that the mood in markets has substantially shifted, and it doesn’t happen often — the last time was February 2020, when investors were in a panic over the emerging coronavirus pandemic.
The S&P 500 fell 1 percent on Tuesday after several countries responded to President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to send Russian troops into two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.
The measures against Russia included Germany’s decision to halt certification of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which would create a new link between the country with Russia, and Britain’s decision to impose sanctions on five Russian banks and three individuals.

President Biden also announced a “first tranche” of sanctions, against two of Russia’s largest financial institutions and Russia’s sale of government debt in international markets.
“That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western finance,” he said. “It can no longer raise money from the West.”
The trading on Tuesday included some indications that investors were hopeful that the conflict, and its economic ramifications, could be contained. Stocks in Europe recovered from an early swoon and ended slightly higher, and the S&P 500 rebounded off its lowest point of the day, when it was down nearly 1.9 percent. The MOEX, Russia’s benchmark stock index, gained about 1.6 percent, reversing a decline of more than 9 percent.
Oil prices also settled, somewhat. After climbing to nearly $100 a barrel, Brent crude, the international benchmark, settled at 96.84 a barrel, up 1.5 percent.
It might have calmed nerves that Russia’s measures, and the response to them, fell far short of the full-scale invasion that some have worried about, said Caroline Simmons, the U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.

“I suspect it’s a sort of hope that this move has been made, some sanctions will be applied, but obviously not the full scale of sanctions,” she said. “But if it continues to escalate, then obviously that would be very bad for the markets,” she added.

One concern is that an escalating conflict could prolong turmoil in the markets just as the Federal Reserve prepares to pull back support for the economy amid high inflation. Fed officials have indicated that they are preparing to raise interest rates, currently near zero, which could slow fast-rising prices by discouraging spending and investment but would also slow economic growth.
“The Federal Reserve pays very close attention to geopolitical events, and this one of course in particular as it’s the most prominent at this point,” Michelle Bowman, a Fed governor, said on Monday.
A war between Ukraine and Russia would be likely to disrupt global supply chains of commodities, causing food and energy costs to rise and increasing the risk of a prolonged period of faster inflation. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat and provides nearly 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas and 25 percent of its oil. An extended conflict could worsen Europe’s already high energy bills.
The high price of oil and gas on global markets could be a problem for Americans, too. Gas prices have risen sharply in the United States, averaging $3.53 a gallon according to AAA.

High fuel prices could weigh on consumer spending on other goods and services as families devote more of their monthly budgets to energy. If the potential for war makes consumers uncertain about the future or sends stock prices plummeting, it could weigh on demand as nervous shoppers retrench.
Ms. Bowman noted that the U.S. had minor banking, financial and trade interests with Russia, and that “we don’t believe that would have a significant impact” on the economy given the small size of those relationships.
“But we do recognize that there are significant opportunities for potential impacts on the energy markets, as we’re moving forward, if things were to deteriorate,” Ms. Bowman added. “Obviously we’ll continue to watch that, and if we believe that might have some influence on the global economy, we’ll take that into account as we’re going into our meetings and discussing the economy more broadly.”
The potential global economic ramifications of the conflict in Ukraine have encouraged traders to seek the safety of Treasurys, which has pulled down yields for the benchmark U.S. bonds. About a week ago, yields of the 10-year Treasury note passed 2 percent, their highest since mid-2019, as traders prepared for the rate increases. On Tuesday, the yield hovered around 1.94 percent. As bonds rise in price, their yield falls.
The potential for rate increases, which could start as soon as March, has made owning risky assets, like technology stocks, unattractive to investors.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which fell 1.2 percent on Tuesday, is down nearly 17 percent since its high in November.

2022-02-25,"WASHINGTON — More than 75 years ago, faced with a Soviet Union that clearly wanted to take over states beyond its borders, the United States adopted a Cold War approach that came to be known as “containment,” a simplistic-sounding term that evolved into a complex Cold War strategy.
On Thursday, having awakened to a violent, unprovoked attack on Ukraine, exactly the kind of nightmare imagined eight decades before, President Biden made clear he was moving toward Containment 2.0. Though it sounds a lot like its predecessor, it will have to be revised for a modern era that is in many ways more complex.
The nation that just moved “to wipe an entire country off the world map,” in the words of Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, also remains a key supplier of natural gas to keep Germans and many other Europeans warm. That explains why Mr. Biden has been constrained from cutting off the valuable export. And the Russia of today has a panoply of cyberweapons that it can use to strike at the United States or its allies without risking nuclear Armageddon — an option to retaliate against American sanctions that was never available to President Vladimir V. Putin’s predecessors.
Those are only two examples of why containment will not be easy. But Mr. Biden has been clear that is where he is headed.

For three decades, American presidents described a series of Soviet and Russian leaders as “businesslike” or even “partners.” They celebrated “glasnost” and ushered Moscow into the World Trade Organization and the Group of 7 industrial nations. Washington even entertained the idea in the 1990s — very briefly — that one day Russia could join NATO. No one has talked that way in years. But Mr. Biden, who came to office last year talking about establishing a “stable, predictable” relationship with Moscow, spoke of a completely ruptured relationship on Thursday.
“Now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin allies are really all about,” Mr. Biden said in a speech from the White House. “This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary, by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption.”
He vowed to make Russia pay “dearly, economically and strategically,” and to make Mr. Putin a “pariah on the international stage.” Those words might have even been familiar to George F. Kennan, the American foreign service officer who became famous as the grand strategist who invented containment, though he later warned, at age 94, that expanding NATO to Russia’s borders was a bad idea, bound to become “the beginning of a new Cold War.”
The “containment” Mr. Kennan described in his famous “Long Telegram,” an 8,000-word dispatch from the American embassy in Moscow, was primarily aimed at putting geographical limits on Soviet ambitions. But even though the Long Telegram was long, it spent the most time explaining the psychology of Stalin’s regime, which Mr. Kennan described as paranoid, viewing the outside world to be “evil, hostile and menacing.”

The similarities to Mr. Putin’s speech on Monday night, in which he accused Ukraine of triggering genocides and seeking nuclear weapons — both false claims — and the United States of seeking to use Ukrainian territory to strike at Moscow, are striking. So was his description of America’s “empire of lies.”

But as Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Thursday, “It’s much more complicated to make containment work today.”
The Soviet Union largely presented a military and ideological challenge, he noted. Yet modern-day Russia is a provider of needed fuel and minerals, “and that gives them leverage over us, even as we have leverage over them.” The force of that leverage was made clear from Mr. Biden’s answer to a question on Thursday about why Russia had not been thrown out of SWIFT, the global communication system for financial transactions.
Barring Russia from that system would be a devastating move, cutting off its government from oil and gas revenue. That accounts for about 40 percent of its incoming cash and would be the one sanction almost certain to hurt Mr. Putin like no other.
But Mr. Biden noted in his speech that “in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.” When asked about barring Russia from SWIFT, he added, delicately, “Right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.” In fact, the debate over SWIFT has been a source of tense behind-the-scenes exchanges, chiefly with Germany. The German objection is clear: If the country cannot pay for its gas, Russia will not deliver it.

But the second reason containment may not work is that Russia has a new, if not very enthusiastic, partner in standing up to the West: China.
When Mr. Kennan described containment theory, China was in civil war. Later in the Cold War, when Russian leaders met their Chinese counterparts, Russia was the dominant player of the two countries. No longer. Last weekend, when China’s foreign minister told participants at the Munich Security Conference that Ukraine’s borders needed to be respected, people sat up in their seats.
It sounded, for a moment, as if China was reining Russia in. But that was Saturday. On Thursday, as Russian forces shelled Ukraine, the Chinese government said that it had approved several deals announced during Mr. Putin’s trip to Beijing for the Winter Olympics this month, including one to buy vast amounts of Russian wheat. The word “sanctions” never appeared in the Chinese announcement about the deals this week.
When Mr. Biden was asked on Thursday whether he was urging China to help isolate Russia, he hesitated and then said, “I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.”

Containment has another challenge that Mr. Kennan could not have envisioned: the rise of cyberconflict as a short-of-war mechanism for superpowers to attack each other from afar, without resorting to nuclear weapons.
Microsoft reported in October that 58 percent of the state-sponsored cyberattacks it had tracked around the world in the past year had emanated from Russia. And that does not count the criminal ransomware gangs that work from Russian territory.
Biden administration officials make no secret of their concern that Russia views its arsenal of disruptive cyberweapons as a way to strike back at American sanctions. Now that Mr. Biden has announced sanctions against some of Russia’s biggest banks, a well-planned cyberattack might be the most efficient way for Russia to try to retaliate against American financial institutions. But as Russia learned last year, the target set of vulnerable American infrastructure is much larger.
Mr. Biden’s one meeting last year with Mr. Putin, in Geneva, was prompted by the Colonial Pipeline hack, which shut down nearly half of the flow of gasoline, jet fuel and diesel on the East Coast — and triggered gas lines at a time of plentiful supply. It was an event that shook the White House and taught the Kremlin some lessons about the vulnerability of American critical infrastructure.
Mr. Biden emerged from the meeting offering some professional respect for Mr. Putin as an adversary. For his part, Mr. Putin said, “There has been no hostility.” At one point, Mr. Biden asked the Russian leader how he would feel if Russia’s gas pipelines were attacked from afar — a comment that some interpreted as a threat to the Russian leader.

For a few months, ransomware gangs were in retreat, and not long ago the Russian police, based on information from the United States, arrested a group of what they described as criminal hackers. But now there is fear that the ransomware gangs could be unleashed, as could hacking groups like Sandworm, which has been linked to the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence unit. Sandworm is believed to be responsible for hacks of the Ukrainian power grid and multiple targets in the United States.
For more than a month, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, has been issuing a series of what she calls “Shields Up” tweets and making public appearances to encourage more resiliency in the nation’s privately-controlled computer networks.
Together with the British, the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, Ms. Easterly’s agency recently revealed the technical details for a new strain of malware it has seen. It turns out that it was derived from one of the most destructive attacks ever conducted, which was aimed at Ukraine in 2017.
For America’s largest banks and utilities, this was old news: They have studied Russian attacks on Ukraine and other nations for years. But for institutions that have invested far less in fending off attacks, resiliency takes time to build up, so no one thinks that last-minute warnings to lock down vulnerable systems, while helpful, are enough.
For years, the U.S. government has warned that Russia has inserted malicious code in American networks, including the power grid, that could be triggered at a later date. (The United States has done the same in Russia.) But so far, Russia has been hesitant to unleash that “sleeper code.” The U.S.-led sanctions may tempt Russian leaders to unleash it, some speculate.

Then there is the problem of what some call “digital fallout,” in which an attack aimed at Ukraine creates collateral damage.
It has happened before: The Russian-created “NotPetya” attack on Ukraine in 2017 ended up escaping Ukraine’s borders, crippling some operations for shipping firms like Maersk and FedEx.
“You could imagine very rapid escalation into what could be regarded as an attack on NATO,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has focused much of his energy on these kinds of scenarios. It is uncharted territory of a kind Mr. Kennan never had to consider."

2022-02-28,"WASHINGTON — Last Wednesday, a few hours before Russian tanks began rolling into Ukraine, alarms went off inside Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center, warning of a never-before-seen piece of “wiper” malware that appeared aimed at the country’s government ministries and financial institutions.
Within three hours, Microsoft threw itself into the middle of a ground war in Europe — from 5,500 miles away. The threat center, north of Seattle, had been on high alert, and it quickly picked apart the malware, named it “FoxBlade” and notified Ukraine’s top cyberdefense authority. Within three hours, Microsoft’s virus detection systems had been updated to block the code, which erases — “wipes” — data on computers in a network.
Then Tom Burt, the senior Microsoft executive who oversees the company’s effort to counter major cyberattacks, contacted Anne Neuberger, the White House’s deputy national security adviser for cyber- and emerging technologies. Ms. Neuberger asked if Microsoft would consider sharing details of the code with the Baltics, Poland and other European nations, out of fear that the malware would spread beyond Ukraine’s borders, crippling the military alliance or hitting West European banks.
Before midnight in Washington, Ms. Neuberger had made introductions — and Microsoft had begun playing the role that Ford Motor Company did in World War II, when the company converted automobile production lines to make Sherman tanks.

After years of discussions in Washington and in tech circles about the need for public-private partnerships to combat destructive cyberattacks, the war in Ukraine is stress-testing the system. The White House, armed with intelligence from the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, is overseeing classified briefings on Russia’s cyberoffensive plans. Even if American intelligence agencies picked up on the kind of crippling cyberattacks that someone — presumably Russian intelligence agencies or hackers — threw at Ukraine’s government, they do not have the infrastructure to move that fast to block them.
“We are a company and not a government or a country,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, noted in a blog post issued by the company on Monday, describing the threats it was seeing. But the role it is playing, he made clear, is not a neutral one. He wrote about “constant and close coordination” with the Ukrainian government, as well as federal officials, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.

“I’ve never seen it work quite this way, or nearly this fast,” Mr. Burt said. “We are doing in hours now what, even a few years ago, would have taken weeks or months.”
The intelligence is flowing in many directions.
Company executives, some newly armed with security clearances, are joining secure calls to hear an array of briefings organized by the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, along with British authorities, among others. But much of the actionable intelligence is being found by companies like Microsoft and Google, who can see what is flowing across their vast networks.

Mr. Biden’s aides often note that it was a private firm — Mandiant — that found the “SolarWinds” attack 15 months ago, in which one of Russia’s most cybersavvy intelligence agencies, the S.V.R., infiltrated network management software used by thousands of U.S. government agencies and private businesses. That gave the Russian government unfettered access.
Such attacks have given Russia a reputation as one of the most aggressive, and skilled, cyberpowers. But the surprise of recent days is that Russia’s activity in that realm has been more muted than expected, researchers said.
Most early tabletop exercises about a Russian invasion started with overwhelming cyberattacks, taking out the internet in Ukraine and perhaps the power grid. So far, that hasn’t happened.
“Many people are quite surprised that there isn’t significant integration of cyberattacks into the overall campaign that Russia is undertaking in Ukraine,” said Shane Huntley, the director of Google’s threat analysis group. “This is mostly business as normal as to the levels of Russian targeting.”
Mr. Huntley said Google regularly observes some Russian attempts to hack accounts of people in Ukraine. “The normal level is actually never zero,” he said. But those attempts have not markedly increased in the past several days, as Russia has invaded Ukraine.

“We have seen some Russian activity targeting Ukraine; it just hasn’t been the big sets,” said Ben Read, a director at the security firm Mandiant.
It is not clear to American or European officials why Russia held off.
It could be that they tried but defenses were stronger than they anticipated, or that the Russians wanted to reduce the risk of attacking civilian infrastructure, so that a puppet government they installed would not struggle to rule the country.
But American officials said a massive cyberattack by Russia on Ukraine — or beyond, in retaliation for the economic and technology sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe — is hardly off the table. Some speculate that just as Moscow steps up its indiscriminate bombing, it will seek to cause as much economic disruption as it can muster.
The longer and more effectively the Ukrainian resistance holds out against Russia’s army, the more Moscow could be tempted to begin using “the armada of Russian cyberforces,” Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview last week.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, disclosed on Sunday that it had discovered hackers taking over accounts belonging to Ukrainian military officials and public figures. The hackers tried to use their access to these accounts to spread disinformation, posting videos that purported to show the Ukrainian military surrendering. Meta responded by locking down the accounts and alerting the users who had been targeted.
ADVERTISEMENT

Twitter said it had found signs that hackers attempted to compromise accounts on its platform, and YouTube said it had removed five channels that posted videos used in the disinformation campaign.
Meta executives said the Facebook hackers were affiliated with a group known as Ghostwriter, which security researchers believe to be associated with Belarus.
Ghostwriter is known for its strategy of hacking public figures’ email accounts, then using that access to compromise their social media accounts as well. The group has been “heavily active” in Ukraine during the past two months, said Mr. Read, who researches the group.
While U.S. officials do not currently assess any direct threat to the United States from stepped-up Russian cyberoperations, that calculation could change.
U.S. and European sanctions are biting harder than expected. Mr. Warner said that Russia could respond “with either direct cyberattacks against NATO countries or, more likely, in effect unleashing all of the Russian cybercriminals on ransomware attacks at a massive level that still allows them some deniability of responsibility.”

Russian ransomware criminal groups conducted a devastating series of attacks in the U.S. last year against hospitals, a meat-processing company and most notably, the company that operates gasoline pipelines along the East Coast. While Russia has taken steps to rein in those groups in recent months — after months of meetings between Ms. Neuberger and her Russian counterpart, Moscow conducted some high-profile arrests in January — it could easily reverse its crackdown efforts.
But President Biden has stepped up his warnings to Russia against any sort of cyberattack on the United States.
“If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday.
It was the third time Mr. Biden had issued such a warning since winning the election. While any Russian attack on the U.S. seems like it would be a reckless escalation, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee, noted that Mr. Putin’s decision-making so far has proved poor.
“There’s a risk that whatever cybertools Russia uses in Ukraine don’t stay in Ukraine,” he said in an interview last week. “We’ve seen this before, where malware directed to a certain target gets released in the wild and then takes on a life of its own. So we could be the victim of Russian malware that has gone beyond its intended target.”"

The state of the economy
President Biden led his first State of the Union address yesterday with a promise to make Vladimir Putin pay for invading Ukraine and praise for the Ukrainian resistance. When he turned to domestic issues, a fair amount of his hour-long speech focused on business and the economy.
Biden said fighting inflation was his “top priority,” and made eye-catching proposals. The president said he would encourage competition and ease supply-chain snarls that have led to rising prices (more on that below). He promised to crack down on shipping companies that had taken advantage of the pandemic to raise prices. He said he would launch an investigation into fraud stemming from pandemic relief measures. And on drug prices, he appeared to embrace the contentious idea of price controls, for example with a call to “cap the cost” of insulin at $35 a month.
But talking down inflation isn’t easy. “Wonder if he connected convincingly on inflation? Felt like a driveby,” tweeted the Democratic strategist David Axelrod. And recent actions to stem the rise in oil prices, like releasing oil from strategic reserves, have had little effect, with prices jumping again today.
Biden extolled a resurgence of manufacturing, saying that the Rust Belt deserved a new name. Intel’s C.E.O., Pat Gelsinger, attended the speech and got a shout-out as the president cited the company’s $20 billion plan to build semiconductor factories in Ohio. Biden also praised Ford and G.M. for devoting a combined $18 billion toward making electric vehicles in the U.S. While the American manufacturing sector has added 400,000 workers in the past year, jobs in the sector, which accounts for around 8 percent of the work force, are still down from pre-pandemic levels.

Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said that Biden pandered to “macho manufacturing fetishes” and ignored the majority of workers outside heavy industry.
Biden’s speech highlighted some of his divisions with the business community. After the speech, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla — unmentioned in the address — had created 50,000 U.S. jobs and invested more in electric-vehicle tech than G.M. and Ford combined; the exchange underscored Biden’s focus on automakers with unionized workforces. The president also invited the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen to attend and thanked her in the speech, signaling that his administration will continue clamping down on tech giants.

The Fed’s ‘nightmare scenario’
The global economic effects from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are clouding what seemed to be a clear plan for the Fed to raise interest rates. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, is testifying in the House today as part of his semiannual check-in with lawmakers.
The soaring price of energy and other commodities could make already high inflation worse, a case for raising rates aggressively. But this could slow the economy as geopolitical turmoil, reductions in government stimulus and ongoing supply chain issues sap growth. These fears are reflected in the bond markets, where long-term interest rates have fallen to their lowest level of the year, with traders revising down their forecasts for Fed rate increases. (A half-point rise this month once looked a near certainty, but now seems unlikely.) In short, the markets suggest that the Fed has less room to raise interest rates without causing a recession.
“The Fed is facing a nightmare scenario,” Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton, told DealBook. While it needs to raise rates to stop inflation, it also doesn’t want to disrupt the markets, she said: “The Fed is going to have to be more cautious in how they move.”

Meet the financier who wants to run New York State
Democrats believe they will keep New York State’s governorship in November, given how blue the state has been for years. But a Republican financier is betting that he can spoil those plans. (Yes, the Mike Bloomberg comparison has been raised.)
Harry Wilson announced his candidacy only last week. He began his career at firms like Goldman Sachs, Blackstone and the hedge fund Silver Point Capital as a distressed-debt investor. He then joined the Obama administration’s auto task force, helping overhaul G.M. He later founded the Maeva Group, a corporate turnaround firm. This is his pitch:
Wilson will highlight his experience in “leading turnarounds of complicated organizations,” he told DealBook. His campaign slogan is “Turn around New York.”
He came close to ending Republicans’ decades-long losing streak for statewide offices in 2010, when he narrowly lost the election for New York State’s comptroller. “I’m the only candidate in 20 years to come close,” he said.
His outsider status is an asset in an age of populism. That said, unlike other G.O.P. candidates for governor, he hasn’t exactly embraced Donald Trump: When asked if he supports the former president, Wilson said, “I’m a Harry Wilson Republican.”
Wilson faces steep hurdles, not least that he isn’t New York Republicans’ official nominee. At yesterday’s convention, the party confirmed Representative Lee Zeldin, a Long Island congressman. Wilson must now collect thousands of petition signatures from Republicans across the state to qualify for the G.O.P. ballot in time for the June 28 primary. (Wilson said that was “absolutely” his intention; his willingness to spend millions on his campaign will help.)
Republicans remain underdogs in the state, with registered Democratic voters outnumbering them by two to one and the incumbent governor, Kathy Hochul, benefiting from a huge war chest. Still, Republicans point to voter dissatisfaction with crime and the economy as issues they can campaign on.

A divergence on divestment from Russia
Exxon Mobil said yesterday that it would end its involvement in a large oil and natural gas project in Russia, joining Western oil companies like BP and Shell in acting after Russia invaded Ukraine.
While the pressure on multinational companies to divest builds, some question whether the sales are a punishment or a gift to Russia. With sanctions isolating the Russian economy, the most likely buyers of these assets are Russians. The financial hit that foreign companies will take could be seen as a boon for local buyers.
Simon Johnson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and the former chief economist of the I.M.F., said that selling assets in Russia was still the right call, because it wasn’t just capital that the moves would withdraw.

“For big projects in the energy sector there is a lot of know-how involved from the side of the Western companies,” Johnson told DealBook. “Foreign companies are pulling out the expertise, along with the market access and funding that they provide.”
But Luke Patey, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute of International Studies who studied the impact of sanctions on Sudan, said that what happened there was not an encouraging precedent.
Western oil companies left Sudan in the early 2000s, he said, under pressure from activists, but they were quickly replaced with Chinese, Malaysian and Indian national oil companies. The Sudanese oil industry continued to expand, and the Sudanese government’s abuses continued.
Patey sees a similar pattern playing out in Russia. Businesses run by U.S. or European firms could be turned over to Russian or Chinese operators. “Western companies can be key investors and offer vital technology and expertise, but that doesn’t mean Moscow can’t muddle through,” he said. “In some ways, it is a conscience-clearing exercise of Western investors that ultimately doesn’t necessarily have a major impact on its target.”

2022-03-04,"The hackers came from around the world. They knocked Russian and Ukrainian government websites offline, graffitied antiwar messages onto the home pages of Russian media outlets and leaked data from rival hacking operations. And they swarmed into chat rooms, awaiting new instructions and egging each other on.
The war in Ukraine has provoked an onslaught of cyberattacks by apparent volunteers unlike any that security researchers have seen in previous conflicts, creating widespread disruption, confusion and chaos that researchers fear could provoke more serious attacks by nation-state hackers, escalate the war on the ground or harm civilians.
“It is crazy, it is bonkers, it is unprecedented,” said Matt Olney, the director of threat intelligence at the security firm Cisco Talos. “This is not going to be solely a conflict among nations. There are going to be participants that are not under the strict control of any government.”
The online battles have blurred the lines between state-backed hackers and patriotic amateurs, making it difficult for governments to understand who is attacking them and how to retaliate. But both Ukraine and Russia appear to have embraced tech-savvy volunteers, creating channels on the chat app Telegram to direct them to target specific websites.

Hackers have inserted themselves in international conflicts before in places like Syria. But experts said that those efforts have attracted fewer participants. The hundreds of hackers now racing to support their respective governments represent a drastic and unpredictable expansion of cyberwarfare.
The involvement of the volunteer hackers makes it more difficult to determine who is responsible for an online attack. Some of the hackers said they were Ukrainians living inside and outside the country. Some said they were citizens of other countries who were simply interested in the conflict. It was impossible in some circumstances to verify their identities.
Their attacks stand apart from the sophisticated incursions made by nation-state hackers in recent years. While hackers affiliated with the Russian government have quietly infiltrated American government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, these participants have loudly proclaimed their allegiances and used simpler methods to topple or deface websites.
And while their tactics appear to have been successful in some instances, security researchers cautioned it was unrealistic to believe cyberattacks by volunteer hackers without specialized technical expertise would play a determinative role in the military campaign on the ground.
“The land invasion is advancing, people are suffering, buildings are being destroyed,” said Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and a former cyberwarfare adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. “Cyberattacks can’t realistically impact this.”

Ukraine has been more deliberate about recruiting a volunteer hacking force. In Telegram channels, participants cheer their collaboration with the government in going after targets such as Sberbank, the Russian state-owned bank. From Russia, where links between the government and hacking groups have long raised alarms among Western officials, there has not been the same kind of overt calls to action.
“We are creating an I.T. army,” Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted on Saturday, directing cybersecurity enthusiasts to a Telegram channel that contained instructions for knocking Russian websites offline. “There will be tasks for everyone.” By Friday, the Telegram channel had more than 285,000 subscribers.
Inside the main English-language Telegram page for the I.T. Army of Ukraine is a 14-page introductory document providing details about how people can participate, including what software to download to mask their whereabouts and identity. Every day, new targets are listed, including websites, telecommunications firms, banks and A.T.M. processors.
Yegor Aushev, the co-founder of the Ukrainian cybersecurity company Cyber Unit Technologies, said he was flooded with notes after posting on social media a call for programmers to get involved. His company offered a $100,000 reward for those who identify flaws in the code of Russian cyber targets.
Mr. Aushev said there were more than 1,000 people involved in his effort, working in close collaboration with the government. People were only allowed to join if somebody vouched for them. Organized into small groups, they were aiming to hit high-impact targets like infrastructure and logistics systems important to the Russian military.

“It’s become an independent machine, a distributed international digital army,” Mr. Aushev said. “The biggest hacks against Russia will be soon,” he added, without elaborating.
A government spokesman confirmed the work with Mr. Aushev.
Figuring out who is behind a cyberattack is always difficult. Groups falsely take credit or boast of a bigger impact than actually occurred. But this week there were a string of attacks against Russian targets. The country’s largest stock exchange, a state-controlled bank and the Russian Foreign Ministry were taken offline for a time after being targeted by Ukraine’s volunteer hackers.
On Monday, TripAdvisor and Google Maps halted reviews at some locations in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus after pro-Ukraine volunteers targeted the sites to share uncensored information with the Russian public about the war.
On Wednesday, the website of the main Russian intelligence service, the F.S.B., was declared a target by the group. A few hours later, a picture was posted to the I.T. Army Telegram channel showing it had been taken down, a claim that could not be independently verified.
“They could not overcome your attacks,” the group said on Telegram, a message that was reposted by Mr. Fedorov.

The worst fears of military analysts and cybersecurity experts — that Russia would use devastating cyberattacks to take down critical Ukrainian infrastructure like energy, government services and internet access — have not yet occurred.
Yet the involvement of nongovernment groups could escalate quickly and cause unintended consequences, experts warned. A malware attack against one target could quickly spill over and become uncontrollable, as it did during a 2017 attack on Ukrainian government and business computer systems. Or a government might mistake an amateur attack for a state-backed one and decide to retaliate.
“In this quickly escalating situation they are taking steps on behalf of the government that can have very serious repercussions on civilians. This is the big risk,” said Klara Jordan, chief public policy officer at CyberPeace Institute in Geneva.

Alex Holden, who founded the cybersecurity firm Hold Security and who has studied Russian ransomware groups, said attacks by volunteers on the Russian government were likely to draw a stiff response.

“Those that support the Russian government and their invasion in Ukraine are preparing their retaliation against a number of different targets,” Mr. Holden said.
In a Telegram channel called Russian Cyber Front, pro-Russia hackers were instructed to target a Ukrainian government website through which citizens can access digital copies of their drivers’ licenses, passports and other documentation. “Attack those who threaten our I.T. infrastructure and dare to attack our resources,” the channel instructed. It was not clear whether their efforts succeeded.
Over the past two weeks, there have been a number of cyberattacks of Ukrainian targets without clear attribution of who was behind the assaults, according to CyberPeace Institute, which has been tracking cybersecurity events in the war.
Malware linked to Russia targeted Ukrainian government computer systems in the days before the invasion, Microsoft said this week, and Ukrainian officials said Russia was likely behind another attack that took down some mobile services. There have been unattributed attacks against an English-language news outlet, the Kyiv Post, and a border control station where people were fleeing into Romania, according to CyberPeace Institute.
Last week, a ransomware group known as Conti declared its support for Russia. “If anybody will decide to organize a cyberattack or any war activities against Russia, we are going to use our all possible resources to strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy,” the group, which is known for capturing corporate data and charging companies to return it, said in a blog post.

But days later, internal files from Conti began to leak online — the apparent result of a hacking operation. The files exposed discussions among members of the group and some of the digital wallets they used to hold cryptocurrency.
In neighboring Belarus, a hacktivist group called Belarusian Cyber Partisans said it had targeted train services in Belarus that were carrying Russian military supplies toward Ukraine, though there was not independent verification of whether the work was successful.
Cyber Partisans, formed in 2020 to oppose the authoritarian government of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, has become a model for hacktivists for leaking troves of information from government and police databases.
After Russia began using Belarus as a staging area for the invasion, the group began working with Ukrainian activists, lending technical support and helping recruit new volunteers.
“This is war and you fight back,” said Yuliana Shemetovets, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for the Cyber Partisans."

2022-03-06,"On a snowy tarmac at Amari Air Base in northern Estonia on Sunday morning, pallets of rifles, ammunition and other weapons were being loaded onto one of the largest cargo planes in the world, an Antonov AN-124, belonging to the Ukrainian air force. It is an artifact of the Cold War, built and purchased when Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union.
Now it is being turned back against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, part of a vast airlift that American and European officials describe as a desperate race against time, to get tons of arms into the hands of Ukrainian forces while their supply routes are still open. Scenes like this, reminiscent of the Berlin airlift — the famed race by the Western allies to keep West Berlin supplied with essentials in 1948 and 1949 as the Soviet Union sought to choke it off — are playing out across Europe.
In less than a week, the United States and NATO have pushed more than 17,000 antitank weapons, including Javelin missiles, over the borders of Poland and Romania, unloading them from giant military cargo planes so they can make the trip by land to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and other major cities. So far, Russian forces have been so preoccupied in other parts of the country that they have not targeted the arms supply lines, but few think that can last.
But those are only the most visible contributions. Hidden away on bases around Eastern Europe, forces from United States Cyber Command known as “cybermission teams” are in place to interfere with Russia’s digital attacks and communications — but measuring their success rate is difficult, officials say.

In Washington and Germany, intelligence officials race to merge satellite photographs with electronic intercepts of Russian military units, strip them of hints of how they were gathered, and beam them to Ukrainian military units within an hour or two. As he tries to stay out of the hands of Russian forces in Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine travels with encrypted communications equipment, provided by the Americans, that can put him into a secure call with President Biden. Mr. Zelensky used it Saturday night for a 35-minute call with his American counterpart on what more the U.S. can do in its effort to keep Ukraine alive without entering into direct combat on the ground, in the air or in cyberspace with Russian forces.
Mr. Zelensky welcomed the help so far, but repeated the criticism that he has made in public — that the aid was wildly insufficient to the task ahead. He asked for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a shutdown of all Russian energy exports and a fresh supply of fighter jets.
It is a delicate balance. On Saturday, while Mr. Biden was in Wilmington, Del., his National Security Council staff spent much of the day trying to find a way for Poland to transfer to Ukraine a fleet of well-used, Soviet-made MIG-29 fighter jets that Ukrainian pilots know how to fly. But the deal is contingent on giving Poland, in return, far more capable, American-made F-16s, an operation made more complicated by the fact that many of those fighters are promised to Taiwan — where the United States has greater strategic interests.
Polish leaders have said there is no deal, and are clearly concerned about how they would provide the fighters to Ukraine and whether doing so would make them a new target of the Russians. The United States says it is open to the idea of the plane swap.
“I can’t speak to a timeline, but I can just tell you that we’re looking at it very, very actively,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Sunday, during a trip that has taken him to Moldova, another non-NATO country that American officials fear may be next on Russian President Vladimir V. Putin’s hit list of nations to bring back into Moscow’s sphere of influence.

And in downtown Washington, lobbying groups and law firms that once charged the Ukrainian government handsomely for their services are now working for free, helping Mr. Zelensky’s embattled government plead for more sanctions on Russia.
The Ukrainians are also asking for more money for weapons, though they reject the idea that Washington is manipulating Mr. Zelensky’s image to present him as Churchill in a T-shirt, rallying his country to war. Covington & Burling, a major law firm, filed a motion pro bono on behalf of Ukraine in the International Court of Justice.
It is, in many ways, a more complex effort than the Berlin airlift three-quarters of a century ago. West Berlin was a small territory with direct air access. Ukraine is a sprawling country of 44 million from which Mr. Biden has pulled all American forces in an effort to avoid becoming a “co-combatant” in the war, a legal term that governs how far the United States can go in helping Ukraine without being considered in direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia.
But as the weapons flow in and if efforts to interfere in Russian communications and computer networks escalate, some U.S. national security officials say they have a foreboding that such conflict is increasingly likely. The American legal definitions of what constitutes entering the war are not Mr. Putin’s definitions, one senior American national security official warned over the weekend, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the American overt and covert efforts to aid Ukraine.
Mr. Putin warned on Saturday that any nation that attempted to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be “participating in the armed conflict.” On Sunday the Russian ministry of defense issued a statement warning NATO countries like Romania against allowing their bases to be used as a safe haven for the remaining planes in the Ukrainian air force. If they do so, it said, any “subsequent use against the Russian armed forces can be regarded as the involvement of these states in an armed conflict.”

Two decades ago this month, as American forces began to flow into Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus famously asked, “Tell me how this ends.” In the case of Ukraine, a senior American official said, the question resonating around the White House is more like: “Tell me how we don’t get sucked in to a superpower conflict.”
A Flow of Arms Becomes a Torrent
To understand the warp-speed nature of the arms transfers underway now, consider this: A $60 million arms package to Ukraine that the U.S. announced last August was not completed until November, the Pentagon said.
But when the president approved $350 million in military aid on Feb. 26 — nearly six times larger — 70 percent of it was delivered in five days. The speed was considered essential, officials said, because the equipment — including anti-tank weapons — had to make it through western Ukraine before Russian air and ground forces started attacking the shipments. As Russia takes more territory inside the country, it is expected to become more and more difficult to distribute weapons to Ukrainian troops.
Within 48 hours of Mr. Biden approving the transfer of weapons from U.S. military stockpiles on Feb. 26, the first shipments, largely from Germany, were arriving at airfields near Ukraine’s border, officials said.
The military was able to push those shipments forward quickly by tapping into pre-positioned military stockpiles ready to roll onto Air Force C-17 transport planes and other cargo aircraft, and flying them to about half a dozen staging bases in neighboring countries, chiefly in Poland and Romania.

Still, the resupply effort faces stiff logistical and operational challenges.
“The window for doing easy stuff to help the Ukrainians has closed,” said Maj. Gen. Michael S. Repass, a former commander of U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe.
U.S. officials say Ukrainian leaders have told them that American and other allied weaponry is making a difference on the battlefield. Ukrainian soldiers armed with shoulder-fired Javelin anti-tank missiles have several times in the past week attacked a mileslong convoy of Russian armor and supply trucks, helping stall the Russian ground advance as it bears down on Kyiv, Pentagon officials said. Some of the vehicles are being abandoned, officials said, because Russian troops fear sitting in the convoy when fuel-supply tanks are being targeted by the Ukrainians, setting off fireballs.

The convoy has also come under attack several times at different places along the column from another weapon supplied by a NATO member state. Armed Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones, which the Ukrainian military used for the first time in combat against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine last October, are now hunting Russian tanks and other vehicles, U.S. officials said.
“All of us have been tremendously impressed by how effectively the Ukrainian armed forces have been using the equipment that we’ve provided them,” Laura Cooper, the Pentagon’s top Russia policy official, said. “Kremlin watchers have also been surprised by this, and how they have slowed the Russian advance and performed extremely well on the battlefield.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Even the elements have sided with the Ukrainian military in the war’s early days. Bad weather in northern Ukraine has grounded some Russian attack planes and helicopters, a senior Pentagon official said. Many Russian vehicles that have driven off the main roads to avoid the stalled convoy have gotten stuck in the mud, making them more vulnerable to attack, officials said.
But the U.S. intelligence also has its limits. Mr. Biden’s ground rules forbid flying surveillance aircraft over Ukraine, so they have to peer in over the border, much as surveillance is often conducted over North Korea. There is reliance on new, small satellites — providing images similar to those that commercial firms like Maxar and Planet Labs are providing.
A War in Cyberspace That Has Barely Begun
One of the odd features of the conflict so far is that it runs the gamut of old and modern warfare. The trenches dug by Ukrainian soldiers in the south and east look like scenes from 1914. The Russian tanks rolling through the cities evoke Budapest in 1956. But the battle of the present day that most strategists expected to mark the opening days of the war — over computer networks and the power grids and communications systems they control — has barely begun.
American officials say that is partly because of extensive work done to harden Ukraine’s networks after Russian attacks on its electric grid in 2015 and 2016. But experts say that cannot explain it all. Perhaps the Russians did not try very hard at the outset, or are holding their assets in reserve. Perhaps an American-led counteroffensive — part of what Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, calls a doctrine of “persistent engagement” in global networks — explains at least some of the absence.
Government officials are understandably tight-lipped, saying the cyberoperations underway, which have been moved in recent days from an operations center in Kyiv to one outside the country, are some of the most classified elements of the conflict. But it is clear that the cybermission teams have tracked some familiar targets, including the activities of the G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence operations, to try to neutralize their activity. Microsoft has helped, turning out patches in hours to kill off malware it detects in unclassified systems.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
All of this is new territory when it comes to the question of whether the United States is a “co-combatant.” By the American interpretation of the laws of cyberconflict, the United States can temporarily interrupt Russian capability without conducting an act of war; permanent disablement is more problematic. But as experts acknowledge, when a Russian system goes down, the Russian units don’t know whether it is temporary or permanent, or even whether the United States is responsible.
Similarly, sharing intelligence is perilous. American officials are convinced that Ukraine’s military and intelligence agencies are populated with Russian spies, so they are being careful not to distribute raw intelligence that would reveal sources. And they say they are not passing on specific intelligence that would tell Ukrainian forces how to go after specific targets. The concern is that doing so would give Russia an excuse to say it is fighting the United States or NATO, not Ukraine.
The Lobbyists Fight, Too
Ukraine has been receiving lobbying, public relations and legal assistance free of charge — and it is paying off. Mr. Zelensky held a Zoom call with members of Congress on Saturday, pushing for tougher sanctions on Russia and urging specific types of arms and other support.
An ad hoc team includes Andrew Mac, an American lawyer who has been volunteering as a lobbyist and nonstaff adviser to Mr. Zelensky since late 2019, and Daniel Vajdich, a lobbyist who had been paid by the Ukrainian energy industry and a civil society nonprofit group, but is now working for free. But American lobbyists are a sensitive topic in Ukraine, after Paul Manafort, later President Trump’s campaign chairman, worked for a pro-Russian president who was ousted in 2014, and after Mr. Trump tried to make military aid to Kyiv dependent on its willingness to help find dirt on then-candidate Biden and his son, Hunter.
Mr. Vajdich said he hoped his clients would redirect any funds they would have paid his firm to military defenses and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians forced from their homes by the fighting, drawing a comparison to early Nazi military aggression.

These groups are structured as partnerships of local firms, so the businesses in Russia can continue to operate, the accounting firms said, but will no longer be a part of their umbrella networks.
“The EY global organization will no longer serve Russian government clients, state-owned enterprises or sanctioned entities or individuals anywhere in the world,” EY said in a statement on LinkedIn.

Entertainment: Netflix said on Sunday that it would suspend its service in Russia, days after it said it would halt future projects in the country, including acquisitions. The Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros. said last week that they would pause the release of movies in the country.
Manufacturing: Last week, Boeing and Ford Motor said they would suspended operations in Russia, while Volvo halted the sales of its cars there.
Energy: BP, Exxon Mobil and Shell, all major investors in Russia’s most important industry, announced recently that they would sell their operations in the country.
Retail: The French luxury giants LVMH and Hermès said on Friday that they would temporarily close their stores in Russia, after similar moves from Ikea and TJX, the owner of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.
Tech: Apple and Microsoft said they had paused the sales of its products in Russia, and Google’s YouTube has blocked advertising from Russian state-owned media. And on Monday, IBM said it had suspended all business in Russia."
2022-03-08,"Google announced one of its largest acquisitions on Tuesday, paying roughly $5.4 billion for the cybersecurity company Mandiant, a provider of services that help businesses prepare for and respond to cyberattacks.
In adding more cybersecurity services, Google is trying to differentiate its cloud computing business from that of Amazon and Microsoft. The rival companies have had a larger share of the cloud market for leasing servers, computing power and internet services to other companies.
“Organizations around the world are facing unprecedented cybersecurity challenges as the sophistication and severity of attacks that were previously used to target major governments are now being used to target companies in every industry,” Thomas Kurian, the chief executive of Google Cloud, said in a statement.
The acquisition of Mandiant, which is based in Virginia and has more than 2,300 employees, is Google’s second-largest deal ever, trailing only the company’s $12.5 billion acquisition of the phone company Motorola, which was announced in 2011, said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.

International pariah
Each day brings more economic punishments for Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The sudden isolation of the Russian economy is striking in its speed and scope.
Yesterday, President Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian oil; Britain said it would phase out Russian oil imports by year end; and the E.U. pledged to shun Russian energy “well before 2030.” Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, said yesterday that it would stop buying Russian crude, after facing criticism for buying a tanker’s worth days earlier. Such unilateral corporate moves have compounded governments’ actions, cleaving Russia from the global economy, with uncertain and unpredictable consequences.
“Defending freedom is going to cost,” Biden said in announcing the import ban. Russia accounts for about 10 percent of the world’s oil supply, so any disruptions are likely to push up prices. Crude oil, which at around $125 a barrel is double its prepandemic level, could rise as high as $175, according to Goldman Sachs. The U.S. national average price of gasoline sits at $4.25 per gallon, a record. That is contributing to inflation and eating into consumers’ budgets, which could slow the U.S. economy (and hit countries that rely on Russian energy even harder).
The effect of the embargoes and sanctions are clearer for the Russian economy, which S&P estimates will shrink by nearly 9 percent this year. Fitch said Russia is at risk of “imminent” default after cutting the country’s credit rating deeper into junk territory. President Vladimir Putin has ordered restrictions on Russian exports of unspecified raw materials, which will further limit the country’s trade revenues.
Replacing Russian oil won’t be easy, as the U.S. and other buyers chase limited supplies. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait could add 2.5 million barrels, but all are all members of OPEC Plus, an alliance of oil-producing nations that includes Russia. Venezuela and Iran could contribute about 1.5 million barrels a day, but that would require lifting American sanctions. U.S. producers could also ramp up production, but it would take investment and time.

American brands quitting Russia has more than symbolic significance. After years of cultivating the Russian market, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and PepsiCo were among the companies yesterday that announced a pause to their operations there. Since Soviet times, these firms came to symbolize the opening of Moscow to the West. Starbucks also said it would close all of its locations and Yum Brands said some of its KFC and Pizza Hut locations would suspend operations.
Although these companies’ Russian operations account for single-digit percentages of group profits, their absence will be felt: McDonald’s, for example, employs 62,000 people in Russia. (The company said it would continue to pay salaries.) “It appears that much of the Russian populace knows little about the attack on Ukraine,” Louis Wells of Harvard Business School told DealBook. “If McDonald’s and Coca-Cola disappear along with Ikea and other foreign brands, people have to ask why.”
The pressure on companies to act is growing, from investors, employees and social media campaigns. The list of company actions compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management, updated daily, is a focus for a variety of stakeholders, and a major point of discussion in the boardrooms of companies highlighted because they have yet to disclose their Russia plans.

Biden takes a step toward regulating crypto
President Biden will sign an executive order today directing regulatory agencies to come up with a comprehensive and coordinated approach to the sprawling cryptocurrency industry. It is a recognition of crypto’s growing popularity and its potential to destabilize traditional money and markets. The order also calls for continued study of a U.S. central bank digital currency, or digital dollar.
The executive order is a response to the “explosive growth” in digital assets, according to the White House. “The rise in digital assets creates an opportunity to reinforce American leadership in the global financial system and at the technological frontier, but also has substantial implications for consumer protection, financial stability, national security and climate risk.” The order directs financial regulators to continue with work that began in earnest last year to understand crypto’s risks and opportunities. It is a step closer to a comprehensive policy approach, but is unlikely to result in new rules anytime soon.
The crypto industry welcomed the move, saying that it begins to address a lack of regulatory clarity for digital assets. “We’ve seen a complete lack of any strategic direction or thought from the federal government for years,” said Louis Lehot, a cryptocurrency expert at the law firm Foley & Lardner. “The fact that the U.S. president has something to say about crypto is meaningful,” said Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, a trade group.
A premature publishing of a statement about the order last night (which was quickly unpublished) appeared to cause a rally in crypto prices: Bitcoin jumped more than 8 percent, and has held onto its gains after the details were formally announced this morning.
The order was not prompted by Russian sanctions, a spokesman told reporters, but comes amid concerns that Moscow could use crypto to evade punishment. Today’s move, rather, is an effort to establish a more comprehensive approach to regulating a fast-growing industry that is attracting ever more money to projects that can operate anonymously and defy traditional business definitions. A case in point: The Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, is a new kind of crypto company that claims, in a way, not to be a company at all. For a sense of the difficulty that regulators may have addressing the disruptive force of the crypto phenomenon, we recommend this deep dive on DAOs, by Eric Lipton and DealBook’s Ephrat Livni.

2022-03-10,"Microsoft has an ambitious plan to cut its carbon emissions. But on Thursday, the company reported a big increase in the greenhouse gases emanating from its operations and its products, a reminder of the challenges that companies face as they try to clean up their businesses.
Microsoft’s carbon emissions were up 21.5 percent in the 12 months through June 2021, after small declines in 2020 and 2019. The increase was almost entirely driven by emissions from energy used to build data centers and make devices — like the Xbox and the Surface tablet — and from the power that Microsoft estimates its products consume when people used them.
Microsoft has sought to show that with committed leaders and sufficient funding, companies can effectively reduce their net emissions to zero in the coming years, bolstering international efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures. But the surge in Microsoft’s emissions suggests that it and other companies may have trouble meeting their goals. And since the increase resulted from strong demand for products, it is a reminder that robust business growth can often mean pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Still, Microsoft’s leaders say they can be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade, by cutting emissions and using a variety of measures to remove carbon from the atmosphere. “We’re still absolutely committed to — and absolutely sure of our ability to meet — our 2030 commitment,” said Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s chief environmental officer.

Many large companies have some sort of plan to cut their emissions, and they face pressure from shareholders to do more. Investors have also pressed oil and gas companies to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
Microsoft is the first large tech company to report this year on the progress of its sustainability efforts. Apple, Google and Facebook’s parent, Meta, all aim to get their net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. Amazon, which has a large delivery network and much more extensive supply chains, has a 2040 goal to do the same.
“None of this is going to be easy for any company — decarbonization is a challenge,” said Laura Draucker, a director at Ceres, a nonprofit group that works with investors and companies to address environmental challenges. But when large tech companies like Microsoft report setbacks on their emissions, she added, it should prompt them to press jointly for policies that promote “affordable, equitable access to clean energy.”
“It doesn’t have any impact on their competitive advantage,” she added.
In a new move, Microsoft indicated on Thursday that it would no longer do specialized work for energy companies involved in extracting fossil fuels unless they had a “net zero” target. The term means having no carbon emissions overall, a goal companies typically hope to achieve through a combination of emissions reductions and carbon removal.
And Dr. Joppa said the recent disruptions in the oil and gas markets had not convinced him of the need to slow the move toward renewable sources of energy. “I would say that I have not seen anything that convinces me that we should do anything other than continue to go faster,” he said.

Microsoft is also active in pressing its climate agenda beyond its own business. When the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the public for input on how corporate climate change disclosures might be standardized, Microsoft said it would support the commission’s development of such disclosure rules.

Government moves to push companies to adopt climate policies could meet some resistance in Washington — especially since the spike in energy prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to calls to step up oil and gas production.
“Private companies are free to pursue net-zero policies regardless of their sense — as long as they’re following the law, this isn’t a matter of public policy,” said Katie Tubb, senior policy analyst for energy and environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group, in an email. “Of greater concern are policymakers trying to use the force of government to pressure or even require such efforts in the private sector.”
In theory, Microsoft’s huge profits give it the means to achieve its goals. And the company has had success cutting emissions from its own operations and from the electricity that powers those operations, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in industry jargon. These fell 17 percent in the 12 months through June, and with greater purchases of clean power and efficiency measures, the company aims to get those emissions down to near zero by 2025, a goal that Dr. Joppa said Microsoft still expect to achieve.
Much harder is reducing Scope 3 emissions — those from a company’s supply chains and its customers. Microsoft’s Scope 3 emissions are nearly 50 times as large as Scopes 1 and 2 combined, and they rose 23 percent in the year through June, after small declines in previous years. The jump came from three main sources: energy used to build data centers; power consumed by suppliers; and energy expended when customers used Microsoft devices, which ballooned as the pandemic drove Xbox use.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Even so, Microsoft aims to more than halve its Scope 3 emissions by 2030. The company said on Thursday that it was working to reduce carbon emissions from construction and to make its devices more energy efficient.
And by removing millions of tons of carbon a year from the air, Microsoft hopes to reduce its total emissions to zero or lower on a net basis by the end of the decade.
One important factor will be the rapid development of carbon removal technologies, which are operating on a small scale and are expensive. Reforestation is currently Microsoft’s main method of carbon removal. The company said it had contracts for 2.5 million metric tons of carbon removal, but that represents only 18 percent of its carbon emissions in the year through June. Dr. Joppa said Microsoft could meet its goals even if technology that removed carbon directly from the air did not work.
But Dr. Draucker of Ceres said that even if more use were made of carbon removal, companies would need to reduce the emissions they generated."

“None of us can fail to see this for what it is: the invasion of a sovereign state,” David Solomon, Goldman Sachs's C.E.O., told employees.

Wall Street heads for the exit
Goldman Sachs yesterday became the first major global bank to say it was quitting Russia, followed shortly after by JPMorgan Chase. The Wall Street giants join a growing list of multinational companies that have pledged to stop doing business in Russia. “None of us can fail to see this for what it is: the invasion of a sovereign state,” David Solomon, Goldman’s C.E.O., wrote in a memo to employees.
Big U.S. banks had pulled back from Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. The only major U.S. bank that kept a significant presence is Citigroup, which has about 3,000 employees there and previously said it had nearly $10 billion in exposure to Russia. Citi said on Wednesday that it would “assess our operations in the country”; it had put its consumer division in Russia up for sale last year.
Goldman’s presence in Russia is small in relation to the $1.5 trillion bank’s global operations: Its total credit exposure was $650 million at the end of 2021. The bank has about 80 employees in Russia and is arranging for the departures of those who have asked to leave. (Some have already moved to Dubai.)
JPMorgan said it was “unwinding Russian business” and wouldn’t pursue new ventures there. The bank, which holds assets for some clients in the country, has more than 100 workers there, but the business was not big enough to rank among its top 20 markets.
Wall Street banks haven’t fully cut ties with Russia. Goldman, for example, is reportedly selling Russian debt to hedge funds. Trading in secondary markets is allowed under U.S. sanctions. A Goldman spokesperson told NBC News that the bank is “not engaging in any new bond trades with Russian onshore entities.”
European banks are more enmeshed with Russia. Deutsche Bank’s C.F.O., James von Moltke, said yesterday that it was not “practical” to close its Russia business: “We’re there to support our clients.” (The bank is taking heat for that stance today.) Deutsche added that Russia accounts for just 0.3 percent of its loan book. Other European lenders are far more exposed.
Asset managers are on the hook for huge writedowns. BlackRock is sitting on $17 billion in losses on Russian securities held by its clients, according to the Financial Times. The financial reverberations from sanctions-induced turmoil could also hit financial firms without direct exposure to Russia, as volatility, inflation and other effects cast a cloud over global markets.

Trading Russia’s debt crisis
International sanctions are raising the possibility that Russia’s government, for the first time since the Bolsheviks disavowed the Czar’s debts in 1917, will default on a foreign bond. That presents another major test for the credit default swap, an insurance-like derivative that played a starring role in the 2008 financial crisis. Amid Russia’s financial turmoil, some warn that C.D.S. contracts could amplify losses and disrupt markets.
A quick primer on the C.D.S. market: Credit default swaps are like insurance but for bonds. Unlike typical insurance, there are no underwriters, and prices are set by buyers and sellers. Buyers get protection for their bonds, and sellers get money upfront but are on the hook to pay if there is default. What’s more, in most C.D.S. markets the buyers don’t have to own the bonds to buy the insurance. Supporters say the swaps lower borrowing costs and hedge risks, but critics say they have created a market of side bets, multiplying losses in times of distress.

How much does Russia owe? International investors hold roughly $20 billion in Russian government bonds. As of mid-February, the latest available data from the clearing house D.T.C.C., there was $40 billion in swaps tied to Russian debt.

What are the chances Russia could default? Russia has $117 million in foreign-currency coupon payments due Wednesday, and if it misses that or future payments, there is a 30-day grace period before default is declared. As of last week, insurance on $100,000 of five-year Russian bonds cost about $45,000, ten times more than a month ago. “It looks almost inevitable they will have to miss a payment now given the restrictions,” Richard Briggs, an investment manager at GAM in London, told DealBook.
If Russia defaults, will the swaps pay out? The $40 billion in insurance implied by C.D.S. contracts might not actually cover bondholders’ losses. Russia has suggested it may pay its foreign bondholders in rubles instead of dollars, which could avoid triggering a default, even though sanctions make it impossible for foreigners to handle rubles. Concerns that the contracts won’t pay out have “reduced significantly over the past few days,” Briggs said, “though it is still a risk.”

Weekend Reading: The coder takeover
On Wednesday, President Biden signed an executive order on regulating cryptocurrency, a signal that the technology is serious business. The crypto journalist Laura Shin — host of the podcast “Unchained” and author of a new book, “The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze” — spoke to DealBook about what the future may hold. The interview has been edited and condensed.
What’s the significance of the executive order?
It shows that the highest levels of government recognize that the development of this technology is inevitable and that, for that reason, it’s important to have a coherent strategy for its adoption — because it will be adopted.
Is a coherent strategy possible given the rapid growth in crypto?
I do think that it will work out. The internet was similarly messy and similarly “Wild West” in the beginning, yet the internet is something we all use every day, and I think it’s going to be the same for blockchain and crypto over the next couple of decades.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
How will we be using crypto and blockchain technology in the future?
We have so many ways of communicating with each other now. In the future, it’s going to be the same for financial transactions or digital objects we own. There will just be many more financial transactions between different people across the globe across multiple different platforms — the way that now we have lots of communication. We’ll be earning interest or investing on this or that platform and voting in their DAOs, participating in these different online communities and having our voices heard in this little democracy, whatever its mission.
What does this mean for business?
My book demonstrates how power has shifted. It’s shifting further away from businesspeople, finance and Wall Street, to coders and developers and programmers. They have the power because they’re building things. It’s reflective of a much larger trend that’s been happening over decades, where Wall Street used to be the power center and recently it’s been Silicon Valley, and now Silicon Valley executives are jumping ship and going to crypto and a lot of the successful crypto people are in other parts of the world. There’s a decentralization of power.
So will this create a “cryptopia”?
People talk about blockchains as these trustless technologies, these machines. But my book explores Ethereum’s history and definitely shows the human drama, how egos and greed play a role and how there’s just a lot of opportunists in this space because it involves money and they see that they can get rich quickly. Despite all that, I actually think Ethereum has accomplished a lot. So despite all the “salacious details” I uncovered — as one of my readers put it — it doesn’t make me pessimistic or doubtful of Ethereum or crypto in general.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, shocking much of the world, Russians working in creative spheres have found themselves squeezed from within and without. The Kremlin’s intensifying crackdown on free speech has prompted some to flee the country to avoid being silenced or arrested. And the decision of Western companies to stop doing business in Russia — including website hosting services, software makers and financial services firms — has deprived many of the modern tools of their trades.
With Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Wise and other financial services companies withdrawing from the Russian market, Russians have been unable to pay for any subscriptions outside of Russia — for example, for website hosting, Spotify, Netflix, newspapers and magazines — or to receive money through sites like Patreon or from employers in Europe or the United States.
Adobe, which makes software that creative workers around the world rely on, has stopped sales in Russia, as have Canon, Nikon and Microsoft, among others. And Sony, Warner Music and Universal, the three biggest music conglomerates, announced last week that they were suspending operations in Russia.
Workers in the creative sphere felt the impact of the withdrawals within days. On Monday morning, Moish Soloway, 44, who owns a record label for Russian artists that works with a Sony-owned distributor, attempted to upload one of his artists’ new albums to a platform that would allow the songs to be played on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music and beyond.

AloeVera, a band that recently joined Mr. Soloway’s label, has been quietly banned from playing in many venues, festivals and concerts in Russia for more than a year. Vera Musaelian, 34, the lead singer, said that after she and another bandmate protested and she married an opposition politician, AloeVera joined a list of forbidden music acts that Russian security services have circulated to concert and event organizers.
To maintain a small income and a connection with fans, the band has relied on Patreon, a platform where members can subscribe to receive content from musicians, podcasters and others. Last week, Patreon sent an email to its creators in Russia saying that they needed to withdraw any funds stored with the platform immediately, because the suspension of PayPal, Visa and Mastercard services in Russia would prevent them from accessing their money in the future.
Patreon “was a way for our listeners to say they’re still with us,” Musaelian said. “Now they can’t pay for their subscriptions.” Visa and Mastercard cards issued in Russia no longer work for payments outside of the country.
Ellen Satterwhite, Patreon’s head of U.S. policy, said in a statement that the company was “doing everything we can to support creators in Ukraine and Russia within the law and international financial limitations..”

Today, it is American companies that are preventing new music from being played in Russia, including songs that could take a stand against the war in Ukraine, Mr. Soloway said.

Of course, with laws that forbid even calling the war a war, and blocks on social media platforms like Facebook and on independent media outlets, the government is stifling creative expression at its root.
For visual artists, Russia’s shutdown of Instagram on Sunday meant the loss of a global platform where they shared their portfolios, sold prints and met people who would commission their work.
“My Instagram is my business card, it’s where I build my brand, where I communicate with my audience,” said Anastasia Venkova, 30, a conceptual and performance artist who fled Moscow recently out of safety concerns. “I have a website but no one goes there. Gallerists don’t want your website anyway, they want your Instagram.”

Ms. Venkova said many of her followers will hopefully stick around by using a VPN, but she is worried that if the Russian government labels Meta, which owns Instagram, as an “extremist organization” — a process that has already been put in motion — even so much as having an Instagram account could put her in danger.

Anya said that sanctions like these would not affect the elite, who have bank accounts and lots of money abroad or hidden away. “This is hitting exactly the people who go out to protest,” she said. “The people who live in big cities, who travel, who have friends around the world, who have international jobs and don’t support the government. They’re now forced to leave the country, or to stop working.”

She added that her problems were very small compared to the violence in Ukraine. “I would give up anything for this war to stop,” she said. But, she said, “the problem with some of these sanctions is that the country will close even more. It’ll play into Putin’s propaganda. ‘Look at how the West treats us, they hit us with these sanctions.’ This strengthens him.”

2022-03-16,"For the past two years, even as the pandemic shut down key markets and created supply shortages, Kevin Johnson, the chief executive of Starbucks, managed to lead the company to robust revenue and profit growth.
But in recent months, those operational and financial successes have been overshadowed by a wave of employees — “partners” in Starbucks parlance — who have taken to social media to criticize work conditions and raise other issues at the chain. As a result, more than 100 Starbucks stores in more than 25 states have filed for union elections. Many either have begun to vote or are likely to vote in the coming months. At least six have voted to unionize.
On Wednesday, in an abrupt move, Starbucks said Mr. Johnson, who has held the job since 2017, will retire on April 4 after 13 years with the company.
His interim replacement until the board of directors names a permanent one is a familiar name: Howard Schultz.

Mr. Schultz, 68, joined Starbucks in the 1980s and built it into a global coffee giant. And this isn’t the first time he has come back to oversee the company. After stepping down as chief executive in 2000, he returned as C.E.O. from 2008 to 2017, when Mr. Johnson took over and Mr. Schultz became executive chairman. Mr. Schultz will also rejoin the company’s board. Shares of Starbucks rose 4.8 percent to $87.10 on Wednesday.
The unexpected leadership change followed weeks of mounting pressure from investors as more stores filed for union elections. “We believe that Starbucks’s reputation may be jeopardized due to reporting of aggressive union-busting tactics,” a large group of investors, representing more than $1 billion in Starbucks stock, said in a letter sent to Mr. Johnson on Tuesday. Starbucks has denied engaging in anti-union activity.
This week, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint accusing the company of illegally penalizing two workers involved in a union drive at a Starbucks in Phoenix, the latest in the chain’s labor struggles.
It is unclear whether the return of Mr. Schultz signals a softening of the company’s battles against unions or a deeper entrenchment. Mr. Schultz, who stepped down as executive chairman in 2018 and was, at the time, one of the largest Starbucks stockholders with 33 million shares, has played a significant role in the company’s response to stores that have sought to unionize.
In September, Mr. Schultz visited Buffalo to address local managers, telling them that the company had let them down by failing to help them address operational issues at their stores, and that he was not anti-union but “pro-Starbucks,” said one person who attended but was not authorized to speak publicly. Other Starbucks executives, like John Culver, the chief operating officer, and Rossann Williams, president of retail for North America, attended the meeting, but Mr. Johnson did not.

Starbucks declined to make Mr. Schultz and Mr. Johnson available for interviews.
After the leadership change was announced on Wednesday, Mellody Hobson, Starbucks’s chairwoman, acknowledged to CNBC that the company had “made some mistakes” in addressing workers’ concerns. Ms. Hobson is co-chief executive of Ariel Investments, a firm that considers itself an early adopter of environmental, social and governance investing.
Jonas Kron, the chief advocacy officer for Trillium Asset Management, one of the investment firms that has written to and met with Starbucks executives urging them to take a neutral posture, said he believed the comment could be “the first signal of a pivot” on the union issue.
But a few hours later, during the question-and-answer session of Starbucks’s annual shareholder meeting, Ms. Hobson said the issue of neutrality was “nuanced” and would limit “our ability to speak to our partners in certain ways.”
Mr. Kron later said he considered the comments at the meeting “disappointing.”
Various Starbucks executives mentioned during the shareholder meeting how successfully the company had worked with its employees during the pandemic, with pay and other benefits improving over the past year.
Starbucks is one of many companies where employees, many of whom worked long hours and under arduous conditions during the pandemic, are now trying to organize through TikTok and Twitter accounts, seeking better wages, steady hours and increased benefits.

Two weeks ago, employees at a Manhattan location of REI, the outdoor equipment and apparel retailer, voted to create the first union at that company. Voting in union elections at two Amazon warehouses will end this month.
Mr. Johnson, a former senior executive at Microsoft who was Starbucks’s president when he was named chief executive, raised the prospect of stepping down with the board of directors last year, he said in a company statement on Wednesday.
“A year ago, I signaled to the board that as the global pandemic neared an end, I would be considering retirement from Starbucks,” Mr. Johnson said. Starbucks said he would continue to serve on the board and as a consultant through September. The company said it had been planning for the succession since last year and anticipated it would have a new chief executive by fall.
The first time Mr. Schultz returned to Starbucks, he abruptly replaced Jim Donald as chief executive when the company was struggling with a downturn in the economy, an influx of coffee competition and missteps.
This time, while Starbucks is on stronger financial footing, Mr. Schultz will have to deal with the rising union issue, a concern he has faced before.

When he acquired Starbucks in 1987, several of the company’s Seattle stores were unionized, as was its local coffee roasting plant. Mr. Schultz made clear to union officials that he did not welcome the relationship.
“He went ballistic screaming at me, telling me to get out of the plant,” said Pam Blauman-Schmitz, the local union rep for the United Food and Commercial Workers, of her first visit to the plant under Mr. Schultz’s ownership. “He followed me all the way out.”
In the late 1980s, workers at the stores voted to decertify the union, and the roasting plant followed in the early 1990s. In a subsequent book, Mr. Schultz said a single worker “did some research on his own and began an effort to decertify the union.” But he acknowledged that he did not want the company to be unionized. 
“I was convinced that under my leadership, employees would come to realize that I would listen to their concerns,” Mr. Schultz wrote. “If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn’t need a union.”
Union officials believed that Mr. Schultz had played a role in the decertification. “We thought it was initiated by a worker that Howard had handpicked to run the decertification campaign,” Ms. Blauman-Schmitz said.

Targeting a soft landing
The Fed, as expected, raised interest rates yesterday, by a quarter of a point. It is the start of what will most likely be a monthslong, if not yearslong, campaign to tame the worst bout of inflation in decades without damaging the economic recovery that the central bank’s efforts during the pandemic helped foment.
A “soft landing” won’t be easy. To slow rapid price rises, Fed officials are preparing to raise rates six more times this year, and five times in 2023, according to their official projections (which, of course, could change). That would be three more in total than its previous cycle of rate increases, from 2015 to 2018, in roughly half the time. Nonetheless, the Fed chair, Jay Powell, stressed that the economy was strong enough to absorb higher rates, which could slow spending and investments by raising borrowing costs. “The probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated,” Powell said.
Image
Is the Fed painting too rosy a scenario? In a revised economic forecast, also released yesterday, the central bank predicted that inflation would be markedly higher than previously expected and that growth would be slower. That combination is usually bad for the labor market, but the Fed also predicted that unemployment would remain historically low. Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed official now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, called this “a bit optimistic” but said that he still thought a soft landing was possible. “Long-run inflation expectations have not ratcheted up the way they did in the 1970s,” he told DealBook.

The bank appears to be betting that inflation will solve itself. The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation is running at just over 6 percent, and the official forecasts expect it to fall closer to 4 percent by the end of this year. A good deal of that drop, though, comes not from higher interest rates, but from the expectation that supply chain problems will fade, even as the war in Ukraine and pandemic lockdowns in China threaten to snarl trade. “While the Fed is no longer using the word ‘transitory’ for inflation, they still seem to be counting on it,” Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed official now at Dreyfus and Mellon, told DealBook.
The market isn’t sure what to make of this. After an initial wobble, the stock market rose, with investors seemingly heartened by Powell’s optimism. That didn’t have the same effect on the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield, which tends to rise when bond investors are heartened by economic growth, roughly flat. Shorter-term bond yields rose strongly, however, resulting in a flatter yield curve that could be seen as a sign that investors think the Fed’s rate increases will hit the economy harder than expected. “The Fed has yet to be tested, but I think what the yield on the 10-year is saying is that investors don’t believe they will pass the test,” Reinhart said.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A Senate panel advances President Biden’s Fed nominees. Speaking of Jay Powell, he and three other candidates for positions on the central bank’s board of governors were approved by the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. The move came after Sarah Bloom Raskin asked to withdraw her nomination to be the Fed’s top banking regulator, which had held up the other picks.
An appeals court clears a key part of Biden’s environmental plans. The White House can proceed with policies that rely on higher estimates of the cost of climate change, a panel of appellate judges ruled. The decision overturns a lower court’s block but could still be reviewed by the full appeals court.

Bridgewater becomes an issue in Pennsylvania’s Senate race. Mehmet Oz, celebrity doctor and rival for the Republican nomination against David McCormick, Bridgewater’s former C.E.O., accused the giant hedge fund of delivering poor returns for the state’s retirement fund for teachers — while charging $500 million in fees. The attack hits at McCormick’s effort to run on his success at Bridgewater.
Chris Cuomo seeks $125 million from CNN. The former anchor is claiming both the $15 million that he is owed from his contract after he was fired, as well as “future wages lost.” Cuomo argues that he was wrongfully terminated after failing to disclose how much he had advised his brother, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, in a sexual harassment scandal.

‘All American companies must leave Russia’
In a speech from Kyiv to Congress yesterday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine urged U.S. lawmakers to “do more” to help his country repel Russia’s invasion. He also called for more American companies to pull out of Russia. “All American companies must leave,” he said, describing the Russian market as “flooded” with Ukrainian blood.

As Zelensky spoke, a professor at the Yale School of Management, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, listened with interest. Since the invasion, Sonnenfeld, who advises corporate leaders on hot-button issues, has published a list of businesses that have pulled out of Russia. “I thought that was terrific,” he told DealBook, referring to Zelensky’s demand.
More than 400 companies with ties to Russia have taken action. The list is constantly shifting, Sonnenfeld said. Yesterday, he published a more nuanced version to reflect distinctions that seemed to be missing as companies’ varied actions and announcements have gotten complicated.
“Some are still trying to hedge,” Sonnenfeld noted. Originally, the list was split into “withdraw” and “remain,” but many companies are doing a bit of both, he said. As company reps have been calling him with “spin” about their approach, he felt the list needed to show more variations, and it now includes four categories: “withdrawal,” “suspension,” “scaling back” and “digging in.” His team was fielding company requests as he spoke with DealBook, he said, and “today we had a dozen begging to shift categories.” (The German industrial group Bosch, for example, moved from “digging in” to “scaling back” between morning and afternoon.)

Law firms are coming under similar scrutiny, with professors from Harvard, Stanford and Yale law schools yesterday publishing a list of what 100 large firms have said about their business with Russia. Some of the firms are “splitting hairs” about their actions, the professors wrote, noting that closing an office in Russia is not the same as pledging to stop work for clients with ties to Russia’s government. “When McDonald’s shuts its doors in Moscow, it cannot mail burgers from London. By contrast, law firms can and do serve Russian interests from afar,” they wrote. The professors will track firms “exiting” (three so far), “not exiting” (about 30), and the “silent” majority. “We believe democracy-loving firms will do more,” the professors wrote.

Howard Schultz returns, again
Howard Schultz, the man who made Starbucks a global coffee empire, has stepped back into the C.E.O. spot for a third time — on an interim basis — after Kevin Johnson abruptly announced plans to retire. It isn’t entirely clear why Schultz, who retired from Starbucks in 2018 after a long run alternating as C.E.O. and chairman, has returned now — but there are plenty of clues.

Unionization pressures probably played a role. Starbucks performed well under Johnson, even during the pandemic. But the company has faced pressure from workers who have complained about labor conditions — and who have increasingly moved to organize. At least six of Starbucks’s roughly 9,000 company-owned stores have voted to unionize, despite opposition from the company, with 100 more stores filing for union elections. Federal labor officials recently filed a complaint against Starbucks over claims of retaliation against organizers.
Schultz obliquely referenced the union issue. “I know the company must transform once again to meet a new and exciting future where all of our stakeholders mutually flourish,” he said in a statement yesterday. (Mellody Hobson, Starbucks’s chair, told CNBC more directly that the company had “made some mistakes” in addressing worker concerns.)
Union organizers appear skeptical about Schultz’s return. “We encourage Howard Schultz, who has been a leader of Starbucks’ anti-union campaign, to put union-busting behind him and embrace Starbucks’ unionized future,” Starbucks Workers United tweeted yesterday. They alluded to Schultz’s previous opposition to unions, including a meeting with managers at a Buffalo area store last year that was seen by some as a bid to oppose the organization efforts.
That said, shareholders appeared happy with Schultz’s return: Shares in Starbucks rose 5 percent on the news.

2022-03-18,"Employers are embracing a workplace atmosphere reminiscent of prepandemic times — elevators jammed, snack tables brimming, face coverings optional — even as a new subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus spurs concerns about health and safety. Across the country, office occupancy has hit a pandemic high, 40 percent, reached just once before in early December, at the same time that indoor mask mandates drop.
After several false starts in calling workers back, company leaders now seem eager to press forward. A flurry of return-to-office plans have rolled out in recent weeks, with businesses including American Express, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft calling some workers back to their desks. Many of those companies followed state and local governments in easing Covid-19 restrictions, arguing that ending mask mandates could make workplaces more pleasant. But some workers, especially those with compromised immunity or unvaccinated children, feel uncomfortable with the rush back to open floor plans.
“Masks have created a real psychological barrier to getting back to office culture,” said Kathryn Wylde, head of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. “As long as things are going in a positive direction with Covid, I think the relaxation of mandates will work for the vast majority of people. As soon as we see a reversal, I think we’ve got trouble.”
The Partnership’s January survey of New York City employers found that 38 percent expected to have more than half of their workers back in the office on an average weekday by late March. As employees come back, they’re facing a patchwork of Covid safety protocols. Just one-quarter of U.S. workers are covered by vaccine mandates in the workplace, according to Gallup data from last month.

This has left many workers to navigate masking on their own, making Covid safety measures a matter of office etiquette rather than protocol. Some have negotiated new remote work arrangements with their bosses as rules have eased, or even left their companies in search of jobs at workplaces that made them feel safer.

“When the rules came out that you could drop your mask, many people were like, ‘Yay, we’re free,’” said Diane Rames, 65, an office administrator at a law firm in Oakland, Calif. “I was like, wait a minute — there isn’t a line in the sand that’s, like, it’s here today, gone tomorrow.”
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
At the law firm Paul, Weiss, a large event on March 10 was followed by multiple positive Covid test results. The firm notified attendees and conducted contact tracing. Paul, Weiss has required vaccines and boosters for everyone entering its offices and has not yet required a return to the office, though employees are encouraged to come in several days each week. Following local health guidelines, the firm no longer requires its workers to be masked in common areas in the office.
“The health and safety of all of our employees remains our highest priority,” said Brad Karp, the firm’s chairman. “We will continue to do everything possible within our control to ensure the continued health and safety of the Paul, Weiss community.”

Wall Street has been quick to shift its Covid-19 protocols after New York State dropped its indoor mask mandate last month. At JPMorgan Chase, masks are now voluntary for vaccinated and unvaccinated employees, and the firm will discontinue mandatory Covid testing as well as the reporting of Covid infections by April 4. At Morgan Stanley, where vaccines are required to enter the office, the mask requirement was dropped early last month.
Goldman Sachs dropped mask requirements on Feb. 14, though it still requires testing. Citigroup dropped its mask requirement last week. Wells Fargo has maintained more rigid Covid protocols than some of its finance peers, requiring unvaccinated employees to wear a mask at all times unless they are eating, drinking or alone in an enclosed room.
Other industries that have made a push for in-person work, such as real estate, have also reformulated their Covid guidelines in recent weeks. BlackRock, which has asked its 7,600 U.S. employees to return to the office at least three days a week, no longer requires masks in its U.S. offices, though employees have to be vaccinated to enter the building and are asked to test twice a week. Prologis, a logistics real estate firm, said its office mask guidelines were consistent with local regulations. Guardian Life Insurance, which has about 6,300 U.S. employees, does not have an in-office mask requirement in most areas of the country.
Still, some tech companies are holding firm on Covid safety protocols. Google requires any unvaccinated employees with approval to enter its offices to test regularly and wear a mask. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, requires anyone entering the office to be vaccinated — including with a booster starting March 28 — and follows local guidelines on masking.
Intuit announced on Wednesday that starting on May 16, its 11,500 U.S. employees would return to the office in a hybrid model, in which teams determine how many days per week workers should be in person. While the company requires anyone entering its offices to be vaccinated, it follows local and state guidelines on masking, meaning masks are not required in any of its U.S. offices.

“We’ve tried to stress that people should feel comfortable doing whatever feels best for them,” said Chris Glennon, Intuit’s vice president of global real estate and workplace. “We are seeing some folks masking, particularly in public areas, but by and large most are not masking.”

Nationwide Insurance, which has 25,000 U.S. employees, has instituted a hybrid model in which workers come to the office anywhere from one to five days every other week, though it says the office is never above 50 percent capacity. The company does not require vaccines and lifted its mask guidelines on March 2. Any employees who test positive for the virus after coming to the office are required to report their result so the company can do contact tracing.
At Jefferies, an investment bank in New York, masks are still required in office common areas. The company has embraced hybrid work, and on peak days, its office is almost back to its prepandemic occupancy rate of 70 percent. TIAA, an investment firm with a roughly 97 percent vaccination rate, no longer requires vaccinated workers to wear masks in common areas, except for where required by local regulations — but noted that it provided at-home molecular tests for employees.
For those tasked with developing office protocols on masking and vaccination, the easing of state and local government guidelines has brought a new set of challenges. Some said they struggled to appease colleagues who wanted looser policies while also maintaining an environment that feels safe. Those concerns mounted this week, as the BA.2 subvariant drives an uptick of Covid cases in Europe, possibly portending a similar rise in the United States.

Ms. Rames, the office administrator in Oakland, recalled that the same week California dropped its indoor mask mandate, one of the partners at her law firm came in and removed all the office signs encouraging social distancing. Ms. Rames has often felt like the “Covid police” when she gently reminds colleagues to pull their masks over their noses and urges people to space themselves out.
She finds herself torn between the partners eager for a return to prepandemic office culture and employees like herself who are nervous about exposure to Covid-19.
“I understand Covid fatigue, but people don’t understand how crushing of a burden it is to try and keep everybody safe,” Ms. Rames said.
Workers with children too young to be vaccinated have been especially hesitant to report back to their desks. Some companies have allowed caretakers to negotiate special accommodations for remote or hybrid work, an option that many working parents said they had embraced.

“I have made it clear to my boss and several layers of bosses above me that I have no intention of returning to the office until my young kids are vaccinated,” said Greg Howard, 36, who works at a tech company and lives in Kirkland, Wash., with his children, a 4-year-old toddler and an infant.

Some workers have even switched jobs in pursuit of safer working environments. Saskia Cervantes, 42, worked at a natural food company in Denver that started encouraging its employees to return to the office last April, as Covid vaccines became widely available. Masks were required by local regulations, but she found that most of her co-workers didn’t wear them. Ms. Cervantes, who is immunocompromised, felt out of place as one of few masked workers in the office.
She moved companies in August, taking a pay cut, because she wanted to be at a business that allowed permanent remote work.
“It was the kind of thing where you’d go into someone’s office and they’d say, ‘Are you comfortable with masks on or off?’” she recalled. “It was like, ‘Look at me, I’m wearing an N95.’”
For many employers, there’s a sense that they know what is required to keep businesses open and workers safe, having weathered the Omicron and Delta surges. And having revised their return-to-office date several times, they’d like to stick to their plans. But they also recognize that as restrictions loosen, they’ll need to keep a sharp eye on fluctuations in Covid case rates, especially with some people ready to walk if safety standards aren’t maintained and remote work isn’t an option.
“We’ve gone from guarded optimism to a more confident certainty,” said Mr. Glennon, of Intuit, though he added that the company was staying vigilant in monitoring the state of the virus. “It’s going to take quite some time until everybody feels that we’re beyond this.”"
2022-03-19,"WASHINGTON — In the first weeks of the first major European land war of the 21st century, the United States has sent tank-killing weapons to Ukrainian forces, but not fighter jets. It is equipping embattled Ukrainian troops with lightweight “kamikaze” attack drones, but not, at least in an obvious way, conducting an aggressive cyberwar to degrade Russia’s technological advantage.
The White House will commit no American or NATO planes to the skies above Ukraine, a move American officials fear could risk turning a regional war into a global conflagration, but it is providing Ukraine with missiles that could accomplish the same task of destroying Russian aircraft.
Such is the tenuous balance the Biden administration has tried to maintain as it seeks to help Ukraine lock Russia in a quagmire without inciting a broader conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary or cutting off potential paths to de-escalation.
Navigating this path has led to a tangle of decisions, and sometimes tortured distinctions, when it comes to what kinds of assistance Washington should provide, even as the situation on the ground evolves, pictures of dead civilians circulate around the globe and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine pleads with Congress and President Biden to do more to help.
The balancing act informs every aspect of American policy about the war, including the scope of the punishing sanctions imposed on the Russian economy, the granularity of the battlefield intelligence provided to Ukrainian troops, the killing power of the weapons systems coming over the border and whether, as Mr. Biden did this past week, to label President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a war criminal.
C.I.A. officers are helping to ensure that crates of weapons are delivered into the hands of vetted Ukrainian military units, according to American officials. But as of now, Mr. Biden and his staff do not see the utility of an expansive covert effort to use the spy agency to ferry in arms as the United States did in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union during the 1980s. They have judged that such a campaign would be an unnecessary provocation, in part because NATO supply lines remain open and there is a functioning government in Kyiv.

2022-03-21,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has said for the first time that public companies must tell their shareholders and the federal government how they affect the climate, a sweeping proposal long demanded by environmental advocates.
The nation’s top financial regulator gave initial approval to the much-anticipated climate disclosure rule at a meeting on Monday, moving forward with a measure that would bolster the Biden administration’s stalled environmental agenda.
The proposed rule — approved by a 3-to-1 vote — aims to give investors a clearer picture of the risks that climate change might pose to companies, because of disasters like droughts and wildfires, changes in government environmental policies or consumers’ declining interest in products that contribute to global warming.
But the consequences could be more far-reaching: Environmental and corporate-governance advocates said the transparency the rule requires would hold companies accountable for their role in climate change, and give investors more leverage in forcing changes to business practices that contribute to rising global temperatures.

“It will make it possible for all interested stakeholders, including shareholders, to then push companies to take real action,” said Bill Weihl, a former green energy czar at Google and director of sustainability at Facebook who now leads ClimateVoice, a group that encourages employees to press for climate actions.
The public will have up to 60 days to comment on the plan, which, if enacted, would set up a reporting framework for companies to provide information about climate-related risks in their annual reports and stock registration statements.
But the proposal has already provoked opposition from some business trade groups and may be challenged in court, which could delay its effective date. Much of the criticism has centered on to what extent emissions-related data falls under the S.E.C.’s jurisdiction.
A cornerstone of S.E.C. rules is requiring the disclosure of information that is “material” to investors, meaning they need it to make an informed decision about buying or selling a stock.
Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, the ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, called the proposal “tone-deaf and misguided” and said the climate risks were not a material issue for most businesses.

“The Biden administration is pushing its climate agenda through financial regulators because they don’t have the votes to pass it in Congress,” he said.
But many companies have already begun to release information about their greenhouse gas emissions; the S.E.C. estimates that a third of the 7,000 corporate annual reports it reviewed in 2019 and 2020 included some climate impact disclosures. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said the proposed rule would bring order to the process.
“Publicly traded companies can no longer cherry-pick climate reporting, and investors will have a much better sense of their exposure to material climate risks,” he said.
Regulators have said the rule builds on guidance the S.E.C. issued in 2010 for companies about disclosing information on climate change. The S.E.C. took that action around the same time the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring some large companies to compile data on the emission of greenhouse gases.
“Over the generations, the S.E.C. has stepped in when there’s significant need for the disclosure of information relevant to investors’ decisions,” the commission’s chairman, Gary Gensler, said in a statement. And more investors have been pushing for such information, he said.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business lobbying group, said it broadly supported the goal of climate disclosure by companies but wanted a more “clear and workable” rule that didn’t force companies to disclose immaterial risks.
“We will advocate against provisions of this proposal that deviate from that standard or are unnecessarily broad,” said Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the chamber’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.
In a discussion with investors after the commission vote, Mr. Gensler said the S.E.C. would seriously consider the comments from companies, investors and the legal community before it enacted a disclosure rule. “We look forward to the public comments,” he said.

Some companies — including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft — already report extensive data and have set deadlines by which they hope to have zero carbon emissions overall. But the proposed rule, which runs more than 500 pages, would create a framework for all publicly traded companies.
Companies would be required to conduct three levels of analysis of their impact on the climate — an analysis that is consistent with the way scientists consider the environmental impact of business activity.
In the first two levels, companies would have to disclose annually the direct impact of their operations on climate change in terms of the products they make and any indirect effects on the environment that come with using electricity, trucks or other vehicles.
The third level is more extensive and involves assessing the so-called carbon footprint of suppliers, business travel and any assets a company leases. The S.E.C. proposal would require only the largest companies to report this level of climate impact — known as Scope 3 emissions — but would allow individual companies to decide if the information would be material to investors.

The disclosure of the Scope 3 emissions, which mainly include gases created by companies’ suppliers or more incidental operations, often dwarf the other two types. The requirement would not kick in for large companies for at least two years in most cases.

And large companies reporting Scope 3 emissions would initially get a so-called safe harbor provision from litigation by investors who believed the companies’ analysis was flawed. The S.E.C. opted for a safe harbor provision because Scope 3 emissions can be more complicated to analyze and compile.
Todd Phillips, director of financial regulatory and corporate governance at the Center for American Progress, said he still had some questions about how the rule would address Scope 3 emissions. But he added that the proposed rule would give investors “access to important information they need to make informed investing decisions.”
When the commission said last year that it was weighing whether to propose climate rules, the public was invited to submit comment letters. A survey of the letters by Ceres, a nonprofit group that works with investors and companies to address environmental challenges, found that 65 percent of the comments filed by investment firms called for companies to be required to include Scope 3 emissions.
Some corporate executives are likely to welcome the proposed rule because they believe standardized climate disclosures will make it easier to compare the environmental efforts of companies.

Microsoft, for example, wrote a letter in support of the commission’s climate push. Large technology companies have cast themselves as leaders in moving away from fossil fuels, but they face headwinds as well: Microsoft, which aims to be “carbon negative” by 2030, recently reported a rise in emissions. The increase was almost wholly driven by an increase in Scope 3 emissions, as the company built new data centers and Xbox use soared in the pandemic.
Environmental advocates hope that rules requiring companies to measure and publicize their greenhouse gas emissions will encourage the businesses to take more aggressive steps to minimize their effect on the climate.
“There’s an old saying in business: What gets measured gets managed,” said Mr. Reed, the Rhode Island senator.
The Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund both applauded the proposed rule and said it should be swiftly adopted. Ben Cushing, who leads the Sierra Club’s push for stronger climate disclosures, said the rule was “long overdue.”
“Companies have made commitments to address their climate impact without disclosing the full scope of their emissions, the risks their own businesses face from climate change or the relevant business plans to achieve their climate pledges,” he said.

Should the rule become final, it would be a notable victory for the Biden administration, which has struggled to carry out its broader climate agenda. The limited progress it has made with emissions-focused legislation has left financial regulation as one of the main tools it has to change the behavior of companies as climate change worsens.
Last week, one of the Biden administration’s nominees to serve on the Federal Reserve, Sarah Bloom Raskin, withdrew from consideration because of opposition from business groups and Republicans to some of her writings that argued financial regulators need to focus more on how companies affect the climate. She stepped aside after Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said he would not vote to confirm her.

2022-03-22,"The conservative group Project Veritas said on Tuesday that the Justice Department began secretly seizing a trove of its internal communications in late 2020, just weeks after learning that the group had obtained a copy of President Biden’s daughter’s diary.
In a court filing, a lawyer for Project Veritas assailed the Justice Department’s actions, which involved subpoenas, search warrants and court production orders that had not been previously disclosed and gag orders imposed on Microsoft, whose servers housed the group’s emails.
The disclosure underscored the scope and intensity of the legal battle surrounding the Justice Department’s investigation into how Project Veritas, in the closing weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign, came into possession of a diary kept by Ashley Biden, the president’s daughter, and other possessions she had stored at a house in Florida.
And it highlighted how the Justice Department has resisted demands by the conservative group — which regularly engages in sting operations and ambush interviews against news organizations and liberal groups and has targeted perceived political opponents — to be treated as a news organization entitled to First Amendment protections.

It is highly unusual for the Justice Department to obtain the internal communications of journalists, as federal prosecutors are supposed to follow special guidelines to ensure they do not infringe on First Amendment rights.
Since the investigation was disclosed last fall, federal prosecutors have repeatedly said that because they have evidence that the group may have committed a crime in obtaining Ms. Biden’s belongings, Project Veritas is not entitled to First Amendment protections.
But Project Veritas, in its filing on Tuesday, said that prosecutors had failed to be forthcoming with a federal judge about the nature of their inquiry by choosing not to disclose the secret subpoenas and warrants.
“This is a fundamental, intolerable abridgment of the First Amendment by the Department of Justice,” James O’Keefe, the group’s founder and leader, said in a video.
In its court filing, Project Veritas asked a federal judge to intervene to stop the Justice Department from using the materials it had obtained from Microsoft in the investigation. The group said that federal prosecutors had obtained “voluminous materials” — which in many cases included the contents of emails — from Microsoft for eight of its employees, including Mr. O’Keefe.

The group also disclosed that Uber had told two of its operatives who are under investigation — Spencer Meads and Eric Cochran — that it had handed over information from their accounts in March of last year in response to demands from the government.
Microsoft said in response to questions about the matter that it had initially challenged the government’s demands for Project Veritas’s information, but the company declined to describe what that entailed.
“We’ve believed for a long time that secrecy should be the exception and used only when truly necessary,” said Frank X. Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft. “We always push back when the government is seeking the data of an enterprise customer under a secrecy order and always tell the customer as soon as we’re legally able.”
According to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, Microsoft had pushed back on the Justice Department’s subpoenas and warrants when the company was served with them in late 2020 and early 2021. But the government refused to drop its demands and Microsoft handed over the information that prosecutors were seeking, the person said.
Because of gag orders that had been imposed, Microsoft was barred from telling Project Veritas about the requests, the person said.

Shortly after the existence of the investigation was revealed publicly last fall, Microsoft asked the Justice Department whether it could tell Project Veritas about the requests, the person said. The department refused to lift the gag orders, the person said.
In response, Microsoft drafted a lawsuit against the Justice Department to try to get the gag orders lifted and told department officials that the company was prepared to file it. Soon afterward, the department went to court and had the gag orders lifted.
A little more than a week ago, Microsoft told Project Veritas about the warrants and subpoenas, the person said.
Project Veritas paid $40,000 for Ms. Biden’s diary to a man and a woman from Florida who said that it had been obtained from a home where Ms. Biden had been staying until a few months earlier. Project Veritas also had possession of other items left at the house by Ms. Biden, and at the heart of the investigation is whether the group played a role in the removal of those items from the home.
Project Veritas has denied any wrongdoing and maintained that Ms. Biden’s belongings had been abandoned. The group never published the diary.

Search warrants used in raids last fall on the homes of Mr. O’Keefe and two other Project Veritas operatives showed that the Justice Department was investigating conspiracy to transport stolen property and possession of stolen goods, among other crimes.
In response to the searches, a federal judge, at the urging of Project Veritas, appointed a special master to oversee what evidence federal prosecutors could keep from the dozens of cellphones and electronic devices the authorities had obtained.
Project Veritas said in its filing on Tuesday that at the time the special master was appointed the government should have revealed that it had conducted other searches that could have infringed on the group’s First Amendment rights or could have been protected by attorney-client privilege.
In the final year of the Trump administration, prosecutors in Washington, who were investigating a leak of classified information, secretly obtained court orders demanding that Google, which houses The New York Times’s email accounts, hand over information from four Times reporters’ accounts. In response to requests from Google, the Justice Department allowed it to alert The Times to the demands so the newspaper could fight the orders. A lawyer for The Times, David McCraw, secretly fought the demands, which the government ultimately dropped."

2022-03-24,"Netflix said on Thursday that it was buying Boss Fight Entertainment, a small independent video game studio based in Allen, Texas, as the video streaming company pushes further into the lucrative video game market.
The acquisition of Boss Fight, a mobile game developer with 130 employees, is Netflix’s third studio purchase since it set its sights on the gaming industry last summer. The company bought a studio called Night School in September, and this month it bought Next Games. Netflix would not say how much it paid for Boss Fight.
Netflix has far fewer development studios compared with companies like Microsoft and Sony, which produce gaming consoles and hit titles like Halo and Spider-Man. And its acquisitions have been narrower in scope.
But the deals point up Netflix’s emerging strategy as it aims to catch up to its competitors. Even Google and Amazon, also big tech companies trying to break into the gaming world, have a head start on Netflix.

Mike Verdu, who was brought on to lead Netflix’s gaming push after working at Facebook and Electronic Arts, said Netflix intended to distinguish itself using the brand appeal of its shows, which could be turned into games. A game based on a Netflix hit could interest gamers purely through name recognition, even if Netflix does not yet have a reputation for making popular game titles.
Netflix executives believe the company can offer a connection between its popular streaming shows and related games “and stories that they love in between seasons of a show or in between movies,” Mr. Verdu said in an interview. He said Netflix would eventually create new, original games, rather than rely solely on buying games made by outside studios.
Other big tech companies had early failures in gaming. Amazon’s first gaming offerings were widely criticized, and Google, after lofty promises, gave up on designing its own games last year.
Mr. Verdu said Netflix’s expansion would be slow and careful. He compared it to the company’s struggles before eventually finding breakthrough television series in the streaming business like “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black.”
“It took a while for the company to reach the point,” he said, where “these original shows just broke through and you saw the promise of original content and the promise of streaming come together in this magic moment.”"

Europe’s one-two punch
The European Union has just agreed on one of the world’s most far-reaching laws to rein in the power of tech companies.
The Digital Markets Act is aimed at stopping the largest tech platforms from using their interlocking services and considerable resources to box in users and squeeze emerging rivals. It could potentially reshape app stores, online advertising, e-commerce, messaging services and other everyday digital tools, in Europe and beyond.
The law will apply to “gatekeeper platforms” with a market value of more than 75 billion euros, or about $83 billion, which include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft. Violators of the law, which could take effect later this year, would face significant fines.
The law is part of a one-two punch by European regulators. As early as next month, the E.U. is expected to reach agreement on a law that would force social media companies to police their platforms more aggressively. And these come after the bloc put the world’s strictest rules to protect people’s online data into effect in 2018. (That’s why nearly every website has pop-ups asking you for permission to track your data.)

Here are some of the potential effects of the new law:
Apple would have to allow alternative app stores for the first time, and companies like Spotify and Epic Games would be allowed to use alternative billing systems inside their apps. Google said this week that it would begin to allow this for some apps.
Speaking of Google, it would have to give Android users options to use other email and search services on handsets in Europe (similar to what it has already been doing in response to a previous E.U. antitrust judgment).
Amazon would be barred from using data collected from outside sellers on its services so that it could offer competing products, a practice that is the subject of a separate E.U. antitrust investigation.
WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, would be required to offer a way for users of rival services like Signal or Telegram to exchange messages with somebody using WhatsApp.
The largest sellers of online ads, Meta and Google, would be limited from offering targeted ads without consent.
Europe’s new rules are a preview of what’s to come elsewhere, since it’s often easier for companies to apply the standards across their entire operations rather than in one geography. Still, companies are expected to look for ways to diminish the impact of the new law through the courts.

“I was speaking for myself,” Jennifer Sey said of her social media posts about pandemic school closings.

Stephen Speranza for The New York Times
When should companies care about employee tweets?
Last month, Jennifer Sey quit a top job at Levi’s, giving up a potential shot at C.E.O., via an essay that was widely circulated online. In the post, Sey said the clothing company where she had worked for more than 20 years warned her against expressing her personal views on social media, broadcast media and elsewhere, that closing schools during the pandemic made kids worse off. She quit instead of negotiating an exit package, which attracted even more attention to her situation.
ADVERTISEMENT

Her departure raises issues like whether corporations can control the personal speech of their employees and the politics tied to speaking on certain platforms, like Fox News opinion shows, The Times’s Sapna Maheshwari reports.
Sey’s tweets went beyond just questioning school closings. She criticized guidance from the C.D.C. and accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of fearmongering. This came as Levi’s was trying to set Covid safety protocols in its stores and manage potential pushback from customers and employees. Outside of the company, Sey’s comments drew threats of boycotts. Levi’s said that its social media guidelines allow employees to speak out online, as long as they are mindful of the company’s reputation.
Sey said her speech should have been protected, since she was speaking as a concerned mother, not a corporate executive. She argued she was subject to “viewpoint discrimination” by Levi’s, and said there hadn’t been a problem in the past when she spoke in support of liberal causes.
Complicating matters is that executives are expected to speak out more often on social issues these days. “A private employer can impose restrictions on employees’ speech or conduct,” said Sarah Sobieraj, a professor of sociology at Tufts University. “The key issue here is where that boundary lies and what about when you’re not working.”

Weekend reading: The deal wave
Mark Sirower has been scrutinizing deals for decades, and finding mostly failures. His 1997 book “The Synergy Trap” examined the major mergers of the 1980s, deeming two-thirds of them ultimately unsuccessful.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In a new follow-up with his Deloitte colleague Jeffery Weirens, “The Synergy Solution,” they examine more than 1,000 deals spanning 24 years, worth over $5 trillion — with similarly dismal results. Yet dealmaking is hotter than ever. Sirower talked to DealBook about this moment in mergers. The interview has been edited and condensed.
What’s happening in M.&A.?
It’s staggering by any historical standard. We’re at all-time record highs. In 2021 we had a huge uptick in the value and volume of deals. The value went up roughly 60 percent, to $5.5 trillion. The volume went up 26 percent, to over 60,000 transactions. This is the number that really got me — the number of big deals. Deals over $1 billion doubled in 2021, so 2 percent of deals made up over 65 percent of the value.
How should we interpret these numbers?
This is the fourth merger wave I’ve seen. When we get to this part of the wave, companies tend to be reactive if they’re unprepared. Companies that weren’t doing deals start doing them, or companies that have been acquisitive now start doing more or bigger deals, and at near-all-time-high market valuations.
Why such enthusiasm?
One of the things we’ve learned over time is that M.&A. is highly correlated with rising stock markets. It’s partly optimism, thinking it is going to go on forever.
What’s different about this wave?
In the ’80s and ’90s, it was still pretty much a U.S.-dominated market. Now it’s very much a global market. U.S. targets last year represented less than half of the total deal value.

Proposals by the Biden administration to limit stock buybacks come as companies like Apple spend billions to repurchase their shares.
Credit...
Matt Rourke/Associated Press
Raising the bar on buybacks
When the Biden administration unveils its annual budget today, it will propose new ways to raise money from big companies and wealthy executives. One of these ideas could rewrite a fundamental practice in corporate America: stock buybacks.
Companies in the S&P 500 repurchased a record $882 billion of their own shares last year. This year is off to an even stronger start, with analysts at Goldman Sachs forecasting that buybacks will set another record, reaching $1 trillion.
The White House plans to propose new restrictions on buybacks, DealBook has learned. This could have further-reaching implications than its plan for a minimum tax for billionaires that’s also expected to be announced today. The buyback proposal goes beyond the 1 percent tax on share repurchases that was part of the administration’s ill-fated $2.2 trillion climate and social spending bill last year, which was meant to raise around $124 billion in tax revenue.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The proposal will call for a three-year freeze on corporate executives selling their shares after a buyback. To support this move, the administration is likely to cite academic research that found company executives tend to sell far more stock in days following a buyback announcement than at any other time. Other research shows that buybacks have accounted for an increasingly large share of corporate profits (often more than 50 percent of net income) over the years. Apple has spent more than $420 billion buying back its shares over the past decade.
Image
The move is sure to revive debate about the merits of buybacks. Supporters say buybacks can be a shrewd use of cash when there are no better alternatives, and give money back to shareholders to reinvest where they see fit. Critics, including prominent Democratic lawmakers, say that they pad executives’ stock-based pay packages by artificially raising stock prices and divert funds from R.&D., hiring additional employees or raising workers’ pay.
The restrictions could do more to deter buybacks than previous proposals. Hitting executives in their wallets by limiting their trades may make buybacks less attractive than just imposing a 1 percent tax, which would be paid by the company. Reversing the trend of ever-rising buybacks could drastically reshape Wall Street: It would diminish a key tool to bolster stock prices.
Some major players in corporate America have already distanced themselves from buybacks. In 2017, Larry Fink of BlackRock admonished companies against buybacks that seem designed only to support stock prices. More recently, shortly after Pat Gelsinger became Intel’s C.E.O. last year, he said that the chip maker — which spent over $80 billion on buybacks in the previous decade — would focus less on repurchases and more on investments in its operations, like building new factories.
Does the buyback proposal have a chance in Congress? In the narrowly divided Senate, it’s unclear whether the two Democratic moderates, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, would support the move, or whether the proposal would survive legal challenges.

Should Uncle Sam mint electronic cash?
A national debate over the idea of a digital dollar has heated up since President Biden recently issued an executive order mandating that the Treasury Department study the merits of a central bank digital currency, or C.B.D.C.
It’s about to get more complex, because today Representative Stephen Lynch, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House financial services committee’s fintech task force, is introducing legislation on “electronic cash,” which DealBook is first to report. The bill, called the ECASH Act, injects a new idea into the mix ahead of congressional hearings on C.B.D.C.s.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The ECASH Act is different, said Rohan Grey of Willamette University law school, an expert in currency design and regulation who worked on the bill. Unlike C.B.D.C.s, these e-dollars wouldn’t be issued by the central bank or rely on blockchain technology. It would address privacy and financial inclusion issues that a Fed-issued digital dollar alone cannot, he added. The law would “inform, complement, and advance ongoing efforts” to design and deploy a digital dollar, Lynch said in a statement.
Cash has its advantages: It’s private by design and can be spent without the need for an intermediary, like a bank. The electronic cash proposed in the new bill would work in the same way, with the Treasury building security into the hardware instead of relying on a transaction-recording blockchain, the distributed ledger underlying cryptocurrencies (and C.B.D.C.s). Grey said there have been “productive talks” with both progressive and conservative lawmakers and advocacy groups. A spokesman for the Treasury declined to comment on the bill.

When health and antitrust conflict
The F.T.C.’s challenge of a biotech deal challenged is drawing the ire of an unusually varied group of lawmakers who say the agency’s antitrust zeal is endangering lives. Last year, the genomics company Illumina announced the acquisition of Grail, a cancer-testing company it spun off in 2016 that now screens for 50 types of the disease. The F.T.C. sued to block the deal because Illumina is the only gene sequencer for these kinds of tests, arguing that the takeover would diminish the screening market, deterring companies that compete with Grail.
Republicans say that the F.T.C. is prioritizing “speculative economist theory over public health.” This claim was made in a letter by nine Republican lawmakers, including several physicians, sent last week to the commission chairwoman Lina Khan. The letter, which DealBook is first to report, argued that the Illumina-Grail deal can’t be anticompetitive because no similar cancer-screening test exists in the market.
Democrats are critical of the F.T.C.’s approach, too. In recent letters to the Biden administration, Democratic lawmakers, including cancer survivors, expressed concerns about antitrust policy conflicting with President Biden’s “Cancer Moonshot” initiative aiming to cure the disease. And in December, members of the Congressional Black, Hispanic and Asian Pacific American caucuses wrote to the administration about barriers to access, saying: “Our communities do not have the luxury of waiting for economic theories to be debated while we die preventable deaths.”

Resolution probably won’t be swift, which could irk impatient lawmakers even more. The administrative law judge just closed the case record and ordered post-trial briefs, but barring a settlement a decision isn’t expected until late summer (and may be appealed in federal court). Meanwhile, Illumina is in talks with antitrust regulators in Europe about a settlement there, which could be rendered moot by a jurisdictional challenge.

2022-03-29,"This article is part of a limited series on how artificial intelligence has the potential to solve everyday problems.
Imagine: Robots that help teach social skills to children with autism. Translation software that provides deaf students with a more fluid and interactive experience. Data analysis to determine effective methods to identify those with dyslexia.
These tools, which all incorporate artificial intelligence, aim to find better ways to detect, teach and assist those with learning disabilities. Some are already in classrooms; others are still in the research phase.
Social robots, which are made to interact with humans, can help teach social and educational skills to students of all abilities, including those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hearing impairments, Down syndrome and autism.

Addressing the needs of children on the autism spectrum is particularly urgent because of their sheer numbers — one in 54 children are diagnosed with autism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
And those students tend to respond to robots “in a way that they don’t to puppets or pet therapies, or to many of the other kinds of things that we’ve tried,” said Brian Scassellati, a professor of computer science, cognitive science and mechanical engineering at Yale University.
That may be because robots seem humanlike but are nonjudgmental, he said. The robots come in a variety of designs, including a small boy, a classic sci-fi machine and a furry snowman, and they go by peppy names such as Kaspar, Nao and Zeno.
In a recent study by Professor Scassellati and his colleagues, an early prototype of a robot named Jibo — which looks like a small table lamp with a round head that swivels in all directions and a glowing white circle on a touch screen as its face — worked every day for 30 days with 12 children and their caregivers. Jibo modeled social-gaze behavior, such as making eye contact and sharing attention, and provided feedback and guidance during six interactive games played on screens.
“The robot’s job was to adjust the difficulty of the game based on the child’s performance,” Professor Scassellati said. But the idea isn’t that the robot replaces a teacher or caregiver. “We never want to encourage kids to just respond to the technology — that doesn’t do them any good,” he said. “We want to enable them to interact with people in a more substantial way.”

Research has found that the robots help improve educational and social skills, but far more studies are needed to discover how to make these changes stick and translate to the real world.
How does A.I. play into this? Technology has advanced, but so has research into how perceptions are formed, how people can infer each other’s feelings and thoughts and what constitutes emotional intelligence. These insights can be translated into algorithms that allow robots to interpret speech, gestures and complex verbal and nonverbal cues as well as learn from feedback.
Danielle Kovach, who teaches third-grade special education in Hopatcong, N.J., said she would be curious to see what further research shows. “So much of teaching social skills to students with autism is reading facial expressions, reading body languages and picking up on social cues of others. Is a robot able to mimic those things we learn from humans?” she said. Dr. Kovach is also the president of the Council for Exceptional Children, an organization of special-education professionals.
While the social robots are primarily used in research studies, there is a nascent marketplace aimed at classrooms and individuals. For example, LuxAI, a Luxembourg-based company, has been selling the friendly-looking QTRobot, designed for children with autism, to parents since early 2021; right now it operates only in English and French.
Children with autism interact with the robot daily for 10 minutes to an hour, depending on their age and level of support needed, Aida Nazari, a co-founder of LuxAI, said. The company has sold a few hundred QTRobots, primarily to families in the United States, she added. But many families may find that a social robot is far too expensive at this point: QTRobot costs $2,000 plus a $129 monthly software subscription, which includes support services.

Rachel Ricci was the first person in Canada to order a QTRobot, receiving it in February 2021. Her son, Caden, 10, was diagnosed with autism when he was 3 years old. Caden and his parents or therapist use tablets to play games aimed at enhancing his educational social skills, such as recognizing and naming emotions. QTRobot serves as an encouraging third friend and teacher.
He uses it for 30 minutes five days a week, and “QT helps him build his confidence,” Ms. Ricci said. Getting the robot during the pandemic was a lifesaver, she added: While most of his classmates at a Montreal school for those with autism regressed when school closed and therapists were unavailable, Caden stayed on track. Ms. Ricci credits QTRobot with that.
But others say there’s a big difference between one-on-one use of a robot in a private home and use in a school setting.
While such technology can be “seductive,” it is “rarely used completely as intended in the classroom,” said Jordan Adcock, who teaches fifth grade in Forest Grove, Ore., and has a son with autism. “What we really need are more teachers, aides and a high-quality curriculum.”
A.I. is also used in a simpler way to help those living with autism: through gaming. Maithilee Kunda, an assistant professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University, and her colleagues created a video game called “Film Detective,” which will be piloted this spring.

The concept: The player wakes up in the future — the year 3021 — and has to help a scientist and her robot sidekick catch a villain who is stealing items from the Museum of Human History. Their detective work involves using a series of film clips to decode how people in today’s world behave.
“Many with autism have superior visual thinking but have a lot of difficulty with social action,” Professor Kunda said. “So, we thought, what if we can give them visual ways to imagine theory of mind?” Theory of mind is the ability to imagine what other people are thinking or feeling — something those with autism can find particularly difficult, which may make social interactions challenging.
The game taps into theory of mind by using movie clips, asking players to interpret why characters acted the way they did and what they might have been thinking.
Without A.I., “it would have been possible to make the game and watch the movies together, but the unique thing we’re providing is a very detailed and explicit theory of how social reasoning works that can be simulated. We can use it as scaffolding to help teach kids,” said Professor Kunda, who also directs Vanderbilt’s Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Visual Analogical Systems and is a researcher at Vanderbilt’s Frist Center for Autism and Innovation.
The use of A.I. to improve visual and auditory accessibility is also evolving quickly.
For example, the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, one of the nine colleges of the Rochester Institute of Technology, worked with Microsoft to customize technology and platforms that already existed in order to caption classes for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The classes have sign-language translators and stenographers, but more assistance was needed.

For the institute’s purposes, Microsoft Translator was “taught” specialized terminology used in classes as well as vocabulary specific to the university, such as the names of certain buildings and people, said Wendy Dannels, a member of the research faculty who is deaf.
With A.I., the speech-to-written-word translation is far more fluent than automatic speech recognition used to be, she said. And spurred by the pandemic, during which face coverings made communication particularly difficult for many deaf and hard-of-hearing people, the institute developed an app called TigerChat. The app turns speech into text messages, making it easier to chat with friends.
In addition, faculty members at the institute are working with Vuzix, a company that has developed eyeglasses that can display text directly on the lenses. Roshan Mathew, a graduate student in computer-human interaction at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has tried the Vuzix glasses and loves them. “When I have to use a smartphone or laptop when talking to someone, I can’t maintain face-to-face contact,” Mr. Mathew, who is deaf, said. “Communications are not just what we say, but what we see.”
A key use of A.I. in special education is its ability to detect patterns in large amounts of data to better identify and define certain disabilities.
Take dyslexia, for example. Those with the condition typically have reading difficulties because they have trouble connecting the letters and words on the page to the corresponding sounds they represent. As of 2020, 47 states required that students be screened for dyslexia in early elementary education. Yet there is no tool designed specifically for this, and dyslexia is often misdiagnosed — or missed completely.

The most widely used assessment for dyslexia is a test called DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills), typically given to all students in kindergarten through third grade to assess their overall reading and literacy, said Patrick Kennedy, a senior research associate at the University of Oregon’s Center on Teaching & Learning. The test was not designed to detect dyslexia but is used “in the dearth of other tools,” Dr. Kennedy said.
Dr. Kennedy and his colleagues plan to recruit 48 elementary schools in the United States and have 4,800 students in kindergarten through third grade take the DIBELS assessment.
Over the next three years, they will examine the outcomes — using machine learning — to determine patterns in the development of reading and spelling over time. Ultimately, the researchers hope to evaluate if DIBELS successfully identifies dyslexia and how it can be used most effectively.
“The purpose of this project is to provide schools with better information to allow them to make better decisions,” Dr. Kennedy said."
2022-03-30,"In the late 1970s, as a young researcher at Argonne National Laboratory outside Chicago, Jack Dongarra helped write computer code called Linpack.
Linpack offered a way to run complex mathematics on what we now call supercomputers. It became a vital tool for scientific labs as they stretched the boundaries of what a computer could do. That included predicting weather patterns, modeling economies and simulating nuclear explosions.
On Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world’s largest society of computing professionals, said Dr. Dongarra, 71, would receive this year’s Turing Award for his work on fundamental concepts and code that allowed computer software to keep pace with the hardware inside the world’s most powerful machines. Given since 1966 and often called the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award comes with a $1 million prize.
In the early 1990s, using the Linpack (short for linear algebra package) code, Dr. Dongarra and his collaborators also created a new kind of test that could measure the power of a supercomputer. They focused on how many calculations it could run with each passing second. This became the primary means of comparing the fastest machines on earth, grasping what they could do and understanding how they needed to change.

“People in science often say: ‘If you can’t measure it, you don’t know what it is,’” said Paul Messina, who oversaw the Energy Department’s Exascale Computing Project, an effort to build software for the country’s top supercomputers. “That’s why Jack’s work is important.”

Dr. Dongarra, now a professor at the University of Tennessee and a researcher at nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was a young researcher in Chicago when he specialized in linear algebra, a form of mathematics that underpins many of the most ambitious tasks in computer science. That includes everything from computer simulations of climates and economies to artificial intelligence technology meant to mimic the human brain. Developed with researchers at several American labs, Linpack — which is something called a software library — helped researchers run this math on a wide range of machines.
“Basically, these are the algorithms you need when you’re tackling problems in engineering, physics, natural science or economics,” said Ewa Deelman, a professor of computer science at the University of Southern California who specializes in software used by supercomputers. “They let scientists do their work.”
Over the years, as he continued to improve and expand Linpack and tailor the library for new kinds of machines, Dr. Dongarra also developed algorithms that could increase the power and efficiency of supercomputers. As the hardware inside the machines continued to improve, so did the software.

By the early 1990s, scientists could not agree on the best ways of measuring the progress of supercomputers. So Dr. Dongarra and his colleagues created the Linpack benchmark and began publishing a list of the world’s 500 most powerful machines.
Updated and released twice each year, the Top500 list — which omits the space between “Top” and “500” — led to a competition among scientific labs to see who could build the fastest machine. What began as a battle for bragging rights developed an added edge as labs in Japan and China challenged the traditional strongholds in the United States.
“There is a direct parallel between how much computing power you have inside a country and the types of problems you can solve,” Dr. Deelman said.

The list is also a way of understanding how the technology is evolving. In the 2000s, it showed that the most powerful supercomputers were those that connected thousands of tiny computers into one gigantic whole, each equipped with the same sort of computer chips used in desktop PCs and laptops.

In the years that followed, it tracked the rise of “cloud computing” services from Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which connected small machines in even larger numbers.
These cloud services are the future of scientific computing, as Amazon, Google and other internet giants build new kinds of computer chips that can train A.I. systems with a speed and efficiency that was never possible in the past, Dr. Dongarra said in an interview.
“These companies are building chips tailored for their own needs, and that will have a big impact,” he said. “We will rely more on cloud computing and eventually give up the ‘big iron’ machines inside the national laboratories today.”
Scientists are also developing a new kind of machine called a quantum computer, which could make today’s machines look like toys by comparison. As the world’s computers continue to evolve, they will need new benchmarks.
“Manufacturers are going to brag about these things,” Dr. Dongarra said. “The question is: What is the reality?”"
2022-03-31,"Facebook is a leader among tech companies in detecting child sexual abuse content, which has exploded on social media and across the internet in recent years. But concerns about mistakenly accusing people of posting illegal imagery have resulted in a policy that could allow photos and videos of abuse to go unreported.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, has instructed content moderators for its platforms to “err on the side of an adult” when they are uncertain about the age of a person in a photo or video, according to a corporate training document.
Antigone Davis, head of safety for Meta, confirmed the policy in an interview and said it stemmed from privacy concerns for those who post sexual imagery of adults. “The sexual abuse of children online is abhorrent,” Ms. Davis said, emphasizing that Meta employs a multilayered, rigorous review process that flags far more images than any other tech company. She said the consequences of erroneously flagging child sexual abuse could be “life-changing” for users.
While it is impossible to quantify the number of images that might be misclassified, child safety experts said the company was undoubtedly missing some minors. Studies have found that children are physically developing earlier than they have in the past. Also, certain races and ethnicities enter puberty at younger ages, with some Black and Hispanic children, for example, doing so earlier than Caucasians.

“We’re seeing a whole population of youth that is not being protected,” said Lianna McDonald, executive director of the Canadian Center for Child Protection, an organization that tracks the imagery globally.
Each day, moderators review millions of photos and videos from around the world to determine whether they violate Meta’s rules of conduct or are illegal. Last year, the company made nearly 27 million reports of suspected child abuse to a national clearinghouse in Washington that then decides whether to refer them to law enforcement. The company accounts for more than 90 percent of the reports made to the clearinghouse.
The training document, obtained by The New York Times, was created for moderators working for Accenture, a consulting firm that has a contract to sort through Facebook’s noxious content and remove it from the site. The age policy was first disclosed in California Law Review by a law student, Anirudh Krishna, who wrote last year that some moderators at Accenture disagreed with the practice, which they referred to as “bumping up” adolescents to young adults.
Accenture declined to comment on the practice.
Technology companies are legally required to report “apparent” child sexual abuse material, but “apparent” is not defined by the law. The Stored Communications Act, a privacy law, shields companies from liability when making the reports, but Ms. Davis said it was unclear whether the law would protect Meta if it erroneously reported an image. She said lawmakers in Washington needed to establish a “clear and consistent standard” for everyone to follow.

Legal and tech policy experts said that social media companies had a difficult path to navigate. If they fail to report suspected illicit imagery, they can be pursued by the authorities; if they report legal imagery as child sexual abuse material, they can be sued and accused of acting recklessly.

“I could find no courts coming close to answering the question of how to strike this balance,” said Paul Ohm, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department’s computer crime division who is now a professor at Georgetown Law. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable for lawyers in this situation to put the thumb on the scale of the privacy interests.”
Charlotte Willner, who leads an association for online safety professionals and previously worked on safety issues at Facebook and Pinterest, said the privacy concerns meant that companies “aren’t incentivized to take risks.”
But Ms. McDonald, of the Canadian center, said the rules should err on the side of “protecting children,” just as they do in commerce. She cited the example of cigarette and alcohol vendors, who are trained to ask for identification if they have doubts about a customer’s age.
Representatives for Apple; Snap, the owner of Snapchat; and TikTok said their companies took the opposite approach of Meta, reporting any sexual image in which a person’s age was in question. Some other companies that scan their services for illegal imagery, including Dropbox, Google, Microsoft and Twitter, declined to comment on their practices.

In interviews, four former content moderators contracted by Meta said they encountered sexual images every day that were subject to the age policy. The moderators said they could face negative performance reviews if they made too many reports that were deemed out of policy. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements and concerns about future employment.
“They were letting so many things slide that we eventually just didn’t bring things up anymore,” said one of the former moderators, who described detecting images of oral sexual abuse and other explicit acts during his recent two-year tenure at Accenture. “They would have some crazy, extravagant excuse like, ‘That blurry portion could be pubic hairs, so we have to err on the side of it being a young adult.’”
The number of reports of suspected child sexual abuse has grown exponentially in recent years. The high volume, up from roughly 100,000 in 2009, has overwhelmed both the national clearinghouse and law enforcement officials. A 2019 investigation by The Times found that the Federal Bureau of Investigation could only manage its case load from the clearinghouse by limiting its focus to infants and toddlers.
Ms. Davis said a policy that resulted in more reports could worsen the bottleneck. “If the system is too filled with things that are not useful,” she said, “then this creates a real burden.”
But some current and former investigators said the decision should be made by law enforcement.
“No one should decide not to report a possible crime, especially a crime against a child, because they believe that the police are too busy,” said Chuck Cohen, who led a child exploitation task force in Indiana for 14 years.

Dana Miller, the commander of a similar task force in Wisconsin, said tech companies could not know whether a report might be useful in furthering an existing investigation. “Even though everyone is overwhelmed, we’re not comfortable on our side making a blanket statement that we don’t want to see those reports,” she said.
Yiota Souras, general counsel at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for the reports, said the center’s caseload “can’t be at play here.” She said imagery should always be reported if it might involve a child.
How Facebook makes its age determinations is also a point of contention. According to the training document and interviews, Facebook instructs its moderators to incorporate so-called Tanner stages when assessing age. Initially developed in the late 1960s by Dr. James M. Tanner, a British pediatrician, the tool outlines the progressive phases of puberty. But it was not designed to determine someone’s age.
In a 1998 letter to the journal Pediatrics, Dr. Tanner said that using the stages to measure “chronologic age” when analyzing child sexual abuse imagery was “wholly illegitimate.” Dr. Tanner died in 2010. The co-author of the letter, Dr. Arlan L. Rosenbloom, now a retired pediatric endocrinologist, said in an interview that a child at 13 or 14 could be “fully developed” under the Tanner stages. He also characterized Meta’s approach as “a total misuse” of the scale.
Ms. Davis said the scale was widely used in the tech industry and was just one factor in estimating age. She acknowledged its limitations and said the company was exploring alternatives."
2022-04-01,"A former Yale School of Medicine administrator pleaded guilty this week to defrauding the university of $40 million in computer equipment that she had purchased and resold to pay for luxury vehicles, real estate and vacations, the authorities said.
The administrator, Jamie Petrone, admitted that she had submitted thousands of purchase orders for computer devices and tablets that included Microsoft Surface Pros and iPads under the pretense that they were for medical studies, according to the F.B.I.
But in reality, investigators said, Ms. Petrone shipped the equipment to an out-of-state business in exchange for money, which was deposited into the bank account of a company that listed her as a principal.
When the authorities confronted her last year, they said, she admitted that the fraud scheme had continued for as long as a decade. She was arrested last September.

Ms. Petrone, 42, who was a lead administrator and director of finance and administration for the Department of Emergency Medicine at Yale University in New Haven, Conn., used the money to pay for a lavish lifestyle that federal prosecutors said included the purchase of three homes in Connecticut.
As part of a plea deal reached on Monday in federal court in New Haven, Ms. Petrone agreed to forfeit several luxury vehicles that included a Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon, Range Rover and Cadillac Escalade.
Her current home in Lithia Springs, Ga., is also subject to seizure and liquidation under the terms of the plea agreement, which calls for Ms. Petrone to pay restitution in the amount of $40 million to Yale.
Karen N. Peart, a spokeswoman for Yale, said in an email on Friday that the Ivy League school had alerted the authorities last year about evidence that it had of Ms. Petrone’s criminal activities, and that it had cooperated with the investigation.
“Since the incident, Yale has worked to identify and correct gaps in its internal financial controls,” Ms. Peart said.

By keeping the amount of individual purchase orders under $10,000, investigators said, Ms. Petrone was able to avoid an additional layer of review required by the university. In 2021, she arranged for the university to buy 8,000 iPads and Surface Pro tablets, according to a criminal complaint.
Ms. Petrone held various administrative positions at the Department of Emergency Medicine since 2008 and worked in other capacities at the university and Yale New Haven Hospital starting in 1999, according to court documents.
While she was under law enforcement surveillance last August, Ms. Petrone drove 94 boxes that had been loaded into the back of her Range Rover and contained new Surface Pro tablets from her office to a FedEx facility in Orange, Conn., near New Haven, investigators said.
In announcing the plea agreement, federal prosecutors said that Ms. Petrone had also evaded $6 million federal income taxes on her profits from the scheme, including filing several years of false tax returns.
On those tax returns, they said, she falsely claimed the costs of the stolen equipment as business expenses. For three years, Ms. Petrone failed to file any tax returns, according to prosecutors, who said that she had also agreed to pay restitution to the federal government for the unpaid taxes.

“Miss Petrone has accepted responsibility for her actions, and she looks towards sentencing,” Frank J. Riccio II, a lawyer for Ms. Petrone, said in an email on Friday.
Ms. Petrone pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of filing a false tax return. She faces a maximum sentence of 23 years in prison. Based on federal sentencing guidelines, her sentence is more likely to be in the range of eight to 10 years, with a fine of $30,000 to $300,000, according to the plea agreement.
Ms. Petrone was released on $1 million bond until her sentencing, which is scheduled for June."
2022-04-02,"RIO DE JANEIRO — In February, a think tank in São Paulo was looking for a financial coordinator. The job was remote, the work was part time and, the post on LinkedIn said, Black and Indigenous candidates were preferred.
For Brazil, the ad was innocuous. Many Brazilian companies have started to explicitly seek out Black and Indigenous workers to diversify their ranks, a step to reverse the deep inequality that has racked the country since the area was first settled centuries ago.
Then LinkedIn, which is dominant in Brazil, removed the listing, setting off a debate over why a company based in California should be controlling how a country in South America deals with its racist past and present. Over the next month, dozens of large companies protested, federal prosecutors opened inquiries and activists sued.
This past week, LinkedIn reversed its stance. The company, which is owned by Microsoft, said it had learned from the experience in Brazil and changed its global policy to allow job listings that explicitly pursue candidates who are “members of groups historically disadvantaged in hiring.”

The case was the latest illustration of how a handful of American tech companies exert enormous influence in foreign countries, enforcing global policies that often clash with those cultures or bring strife, abuse or other unintended consequences.
“There are a lot of pros to global connectivity that I would hate to give up,” said Eileen Donahoe, a former Obama administration official who now studies global digital policies at Stanford University. “But what’s coming to the surface in this instance is the underside of that global connectivity and global dominance.”
In this case, the backlash succeeded in changing LinkedIn’s rules, not only in Brazil, but also across the world. LinkedIn’s about-face shows how countries are increasingly pushing back against big tech companies and forcing changes in their policies, with global implications.
A European data-privacy law that went into effect in 2018 largely led to the worldwide proliferation of alerts on websites that ask visitors to accept “cookies,” or the tracking software embedded behind most web pages. The European Union is now set to approve new rules that could force tech companies to make their messaging apps work with rivals’ products, probably affecting people far beyond the bloc. And late last year, an investigation in Japan caused Apple to revise important rules for many app makers, while guidelines in Britain prompted tech giants to alter how their products work to protect minors better across the world.

Like many countries, Brazil has a brutal history of racism. From the arrival of the first European settlers, Indigenous people were slaughtered for hundreds of years. Brazil imported more slaves than any other country and was the last nation in the Americas to abolish slavery, in 1888. And today, in a country where more than half the population is Black, Black people hold fewer than 1 in 100 corporate management positions, according to one study.

The fight for equality has gained steam in recent years, in part fueled by a surge of affirmative action programs. In 2020, Magazine Luiza, a Brazilian retail giant with more than 1,400 stores, announced that its executive trainee program would be open only to Black candidates.
The announcement ignited a national debate. Many conservatives in Brazil criticized the company, calling its policy racist, while many on the left cheered it on. “We were ‘canceled’ on social media, even by congressmen,” said Frederico Trajano, Magazine Luiza’s chief executive. Yet since then, similar policies in Brazil “have taken off,” he said. “The number of new initiatives is impressive.”
In the United States, companies including Google, Twitter and J.P. Morgan have introduced internship programs in recent years that are limited to certain minorities, framed as a way to create a more diverse pipeline of talent. But while there have been broad efforts to diversify the white-collar workforces at many American companies, U.S. law generally prohibits job ads that show a preference for a specific race.

In Brazil, several recent court decisions have upheld affirmative action policies, making the law more clear that companies can give preference to Black and Indigenous employees, said Elisiane Santos, a prosecutor in the federal labor prosecutor’s office. “It certainly is legal,” she said.
As a result, companies have become bolder. So when Laut, a research institute in São Paulo, posted its ad for a financial coordinator that “gave preference” to Black and Indigenous candidates, the move was hardly groundbreaking. It was more surprising when, three days later, on Feb. 28, LinkedIn removed the ad and told Laut, the Center for the Analysis of Freedom and Authoritarianism, in an email that the listing violated its policies.
Natura & Co., a Brazilian personal beauty company with 35,000 employees, later said that LinkedIn had also taken down its ad seeking a person of color for a management job.
The move by LinkedIn revived the national debate on affirmative action policies. LinkedIn was targeted by the left and seen as a champion of the right.
“LinkedIn’s stance toward Brazil is a colonialist use of the law to protect racism,” Pedro Abramovay, the former No. 2 official in Brazil’s Justice Department, said on Twitter.

LinkedIn’s official account responded, saying its policy applied to all users globally and prohibited job listings that give preference to, or exclude, candidates based on “age, gender, religion, ethnicity, race or sexual orientation.”
Raphael Vicente, a São Paulo lawyer and professor who runs an initiative to promote affirmative action policies, began gathering signatures from corporations for a letter protesting the policy. More than 40 companies signed on, including Coca-Cola, Intel, Procter & Gamble, Bayer and Unilever. “Such a policy can be a huge setback for the country,” Mr. Vicente wrote, adding that it would reverse the effect of the affirmative action programs that activists like him had fought for.

LinkedIn is dominant in Brazil for job listings. Brazil is LinkedIn’s third-largest market, after the United States and India, with 55 million users, or one in every four people in Brazil.
After LinkedIn took down the ads, the federal prosecutor’s office in São Paulo, the federal labor prosecutor and a federal consumer-rights agency all sent notices to the company requesting more information. Educafro, a racial-justice group, then sued LinkedIn, saying its policy was racist and violated Brazilian law. The group asked for more than $2 million in damages, which it said it would use for education programs for Black people.

On Tuesday, after The New York Times sought comment on its removal of the job listings, LinkedIn said it was changing its policy to allow such ads, as long as they are legal in a given country. “Getting this right is important and we’re committed to continuing to learn and improve,” the company said in a statement. It declined to comment further.
In 2010, a federal law in Brazil required companies to create “equal opportunities in the labor market for the Black population,” though it did not specify how. In 2012, Brazil’s Supreme Court backed racial quotas in public universities. And in 2014, a new law required that 20 percent of people hired through public service exams be Black.
Mr. Vicente said that when he and other activists began pushing affirmative action in Brazil in 2015, Brazilian companies still balked. “Now a global company has had to retreat on the subject,” he said. “This message to companies here is very clear.”"

2022-04-06,"SAN FRANCISCO — At OpenAI, one of the world’s most ambitious artificial intelligence labs, researchers are building technology that lets you create digital images simply by describing what you want to see.
They call it DALL-E in a nod to both “WALL-E,” the 2008 animated movie about an autonomous robot, and Salvador Dalí, the surrealist painter.
OpenAI, backed by a billion dollars in funding from Microsoft, is not yet sharing the technology with the general public. But on a recent afternoon, Alex Nichol, one of the researchers behind the system, demonstrated how it works.

When he asked for “a teapot in the shape of an avocado,” typing those words into a largely empty computer screen, the system created 10 distinct images of a dark green avocado teapot, some with pits and some without. “DALL-E is good at avocados,” Mr. Nichol said.

When he typed “cats playing chess,” it put two fluffy kittens on either side of a checkered game board, 32 chess pieces lined up between them. When he summoned “a teddy bear playing a trumpet underwater,” one image showed tiny air bubbles rising from the end of the bear’s trumpet toward the surface of the water.
DALL-E can also edit photos. When Mr. Nichol erased the teddy bear’s trumpet and asked for a guitar instead, a guitar appeared between the furry arms.
A team of seven researchers spent two years developing the technology, which OpenAI plans to eventually offer as a tool for people like graphic artists, providing new shortcuts and new ideas as they create and edit digital images. Computer programmers already use Copilot, a tool based on similar technology from OpenAI, to generate snippets of software code.
But for many experts, DALL-E is worrisome. As this kind of technology continues to improve, they say, it could help spread disinformation across the internet, feeding the kind of online campaigns that may have helped sway the 2016 presidential election.

“You could use it for good things, but certainly you could use it for all sorts of other crazy, worrying applications, and that includes deep fakes,” like misleading photos and videos, said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor of computer science at Arizona State University.

A half decade ago, the world’s leading A.I. labs built systems that could identify objects in digital images and even generate images on their own, including flowers, dogs, cars and faces. A few years later, they built systems that could do much the same with written language, summarizing articles, answering questions, generating tweets and even writing blog posts.
Now, researchers are combining those technologies to create new forms of A.I. DALL-E is a notable step forward because it juggles both language and images and, in some cases, grasps the relationship between the two.
“We can now use multiple, intersecting streams of information to create better and better technology,” said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, an artificial intelligence lab in Seattle.

The technology is not perfect. When Mr. Nichol asked DALL-E to “put the Eiffel Tower on the moon,” it did not quite grasp the idea. It put the moon in the sky above the tower. When he asked for “a living room filled with sand,” it produced a scene that looked more like a construction site than a living room.
But when Mr. Nichol tweaked his requests a little, adding or subtracting a few words here or there, it provided what he wanted. When he asked for “a piano in a living room filled with sand,” the image looked more like a beach in a living room.

DALL-E is what artificial intelligence researchers call a neural network, which is a mathematical system loosely modeled on the network of neurons in the brain. That is the same technology that recognizes the commands spoken into smartphones and identifies the presence of pedestrians as self-driving cars navigate city streets.
A neural network learns skills by analyzing large amounts of data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of avocado photos, for example, it can learn to recognize an avocado. DALL-E looks for patterns as it analyzes millions of digital images as well as text captions that describe what each image depicts. In this way, it learns to recognize the links between the images and the words.

When someone describes an image for DALL-E, it generates a set of key features that this image might include. One feature might be the line at the edge of a trumpet. Another might be the curve at the top of a teddy bear’s ear.
Then, a second neural network, called a diffusion model, creates the image and generates the pixels needed to realize these features. The latest version of DALL-E, unveiled on Wednesday with a new research paper describing the system, generates high-resolution images that in many cases look like photos.
Though DALL-E often fails to understand what someone has described and sometimes mangles the image it produces, OpenAI continues to improve the technology. Researchers can often refine the skills of a neural network by feeding it even larger amounts of data.
They can also build more powerful systems by applying the same concepts to new types of data. The Allen Institute recently created a system that can analyze audio as well as imagery and text. After analyzing millions of YouTube videos, including audio tracks and captions, it learned to identify particular moments in TV shows or movies, like a barking dog or a shutting door.
Experts believe researchers will continue to hone such systems. Ultimately, those systems could help companies improve search engines, digital assistants and other common technologies as well as automate new tasks for graphic artists, programmers and other professionals.

But there are caveats to that potential. The A.I. systems can show bias against women and people of color, in part because they learn their skills from enormous pools of online text, images and other data that show bias. They could be used to generate pornography, hate speech and other offensive material. And many experts believe the technology will eventually make it so easy to create disinformation, people will have to be skeptical of nearly everything they see online.
“We can forge text. We can put text into someone’s voice. And we can forge images and videos,” Dr. Etzioni said. “There is already disinformation online, but the worry is that this scale disinformation to new levels.”
OpenAI is keeping a tight leash on DALL-E. It would not let outsiders use the system on their own. It puts a watermark in the corner of each image it generates. And though the lab plans on opening the system to testers this week, the group will be small.
The system also includes filters that prevent users from generating what it deems inappropriate images. When asked for “a pig with the head of a sheep,” it declined to produce an image. The combination of the words “pig” and “head” most likely tripped OpenAI’s anti-bullying filters, according to the lab.
“This is not a product,” said Mira Murati, OpenAI’s head of research. “The idea is understand capabilities and limitations and give us the opportunity to build in mitigation.”

OpenAI can control the system’s behavior in some ways. But others across the globe may soon create similar technology that puts the same powers in the hands of almost anyone. Working from a research paper describing an early version of DALL-E, Boris Dayma, an independent researcher in Houston, has already built and released a simpler version of the technology.
“People need to know that the images they see may not be real,” he said."

The way that the gun industry advertises its products faces growing scrutiny.
Credit...
Daniel Acker for The New York Times
Illusion of safety?
Gun control advocates are petitioning the Federal Trade Commission today to investigate and regulate the firearms industry as it has with tobacco, alleging that gun manufacturers use deceptive advertising practices.
The petition, which DealBook is first to report, is the latest salvo aimed at the marketing tactics of an industry that has largely been protected from liability for the harms of its products because of federal laws. The groups urging action by the F.T.C. include Brady, the Giffords Law Center, March for Our Lives and the Firearms Accountability Counsel Taskforce.
Gun marketing promotes an illusion of safety, the petitioners say. Americans have “been falsely led to believe that gun ownership is a safe way to protect their home and family,” they argue. The C.D.C. reported 45,222 deaths from gun-related injuries in 2020 (an earlier version of this item misstated the year, because of an editing error). The F.T.C. “has effectively given the gun industry a free pass,” the petitioners say.
Advocates have asked the F.T.C. to investigate the gun industry before, starting in 1996. The F.T.C. can choose to address or ignore this latest petition, which comes as the Biden administration has expressed support for more transparency on gun manufacturers’ operations and state-level lawsuits have begun to break through the industry’s barriers to litigation.
In February, the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims settled a suit for $73 million against Remington that alleged the gun maker’s aggressive marketing violated Connecticut law by promoting firearms to troubled men like the one responsible for the massacre. The settlement opens internal company documents to scrutiny, which would offer a rare view into how gun makers like Remington develop their marketing messages. President Biden described it as a step in “holding gun manufacturers accountable for manufacturing weapons of war and irresponsibly marketing these firearms.”
Last year, a New Jersey judge ruled in favor of the state’s attorney general in a lawsuit against Smith & Wesson for its advertising practices, requiring the company to release internal documents. The ruling was recently overturned, leaving the state’s lawsuit intact but the release of documents uncertain. Smith & Wesson said in a filing that the suit sought to “suppress and punish lawful speech regarding gun ownership in order to advance an anti-Second Amendment agenda.”
The F.T.C.’s enforcement of federal consumer protection law could look to these state precedents, like the Connecticut consumer law that allowed the Sandy Hook families to sue. “If a company violates the consumer protection laws with false advertisements, that is not protected activity,” said David Pucino of the Giffords Law Center. “They are breaking the law.”

2022-04-08,"As a middle school student in New York, Shekinah Griffith saw a television news report of President Barack Obama visiting an innovative school in Brooklyn. Its program included high school, an associate degree in a technical subject, an internship and the promise of a good job.
“I thought, ‘This is somewhere I need to be,’” Ms. Griffith recalled. “There are not many opportunities like that for people like me.”
She applied, was accepted and thrived in the courses. After school, an internship and an 18-month apprenticeship, she became a full-time employee at IBM at the end of 2020. Today Ms. Griffith, 21, is a cybersecurity technical specialist and earns more than $100,000 a year.
In the last few years, major American companies in every industry have pledged to change their hiring habits by opening the door to higher-wage jobs with career paths to people without four-year college degrees, like Ms. Griffith. More than 100 companies have made commitments, including the Business Roundtable’s Multiple Pathways program and OneTen, which is focused on hiring and promoting Black workers without college degrees to good jobs.

How has corporate America done so far? There has been a gradual shift overall, according to a recent report and additional data supplied by the Burning Glass Institute. But the research group’s company-by-company analysis underlines both the potential and the challenge of changing entrenched hiring practices.
The Burning Glass Institute is an independent nonprofit research center, using data from Emsi Burning Glass, a labor-market analytics firm. The researchers analyzed millions of online job listings, looking for four-year college degree requirements and trends. In 2017, 51 percent required the degree. By 2021, that share had declined to 44 percent.
Work force experts see removing the four-year college degree filter for some jobs as key to increasing diversity and reducing inequality. Workers, they say, should be selected and promoted because of their skills and experience rather than degrees or educational pedigree. And companies that do change their hiring practices, they add, benefit by tapping previously overlooked pools of talent in a tight labor market, as well as diversifying their work forces.
Nearly two-thirds of American workers do not have a four-year college degree. Screening by college degree hits minorities particularly hard, eliminating 76 percent of Black adults and 83 percent of Latino adults.
Companies that have trimmed back degree requirements typically began doing so before the pandemic, the Burning Glass analysis found. Nonprofit groups like Opportunity@Work, founded in 2015, and the Markle Foundation’s Skillful program, begun in 2016, had been prodding companies to adopt skills-based hiring.

But the pandemic labor crunch and calls on corporate America to address racial discrimination after the murder of George Floyd two years ago prompted more companies to rethink hiring. An aging work force, changing demographics, immigration curbs, and diversity, equity and inclusion programs are forcing change, experts say.
“Things are coming together that we really haven’t seen before,” said Joseph Fuller, a professor at the Harvard Business School and a co-author of the Burning Glass report, which was published in February.
The Burning Glass research underlines a trend that is “real and sustained,” said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., chief executive of the Society for Human Resource Management. “Employers don’t have the luxury of excluding talent. They have to be more inclusive of necessity.”
While citing “college degree” in a job posting isn’t actual hiring, work force experts say it is an important signal of corporate hiring behavior.
“For diversity goals, the biggest lever you can pull is eliminating the four-year degree filter,” said Elyse Rosenblum, managing director of Grads of Life, which advises companies on inclusive hiring practices.

There are judgment calls in the Burning Glass research. For example, companies can list the required qualification for a job as “bachelor’s degree or equivalent practical experience.” Still, such wording suggests a bias toward a college degree, the researchers concluded.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Detailed analysis of companies in the same industry found sizable differences in the degree requirements for entry-level jobs that tend to be steppingstones to higher-paying roles and career paths of upward mobility. Several are technical occupations, such as computer support specialist, software developer and software quality assurance engineer.
Successful training programs for the disadvantaged, like Year Up and Per Scholas, have focused on tech jobs because demand is strong and the skills can be demonstrated through coding tests or industry-recognized certificates.
Dropping the college degree qualification for jobs requires work. The skills needed for a job have to be explained more clearly, and hiring managers have to be trained. Institutional habits, work force experts note, run deep. Companies reflexively seek out not only college graduates but ones from a handful of favorite schools.
“This is still hand-to-hand combat at the company level,” said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute and a co-author of the report.

In the company data, some employers that have championed skills-based hiring and generously supported upward-mobility programs still have generally high levels of four-year degree requirements in their hiring.
Microsoft, for example, is a major financial supporter of Markle’s Skillful program and a member of the Rework America Business Network, a group of companies that have pledged to move toward skills-based hiring. Microsoft and its LinkedIn subsidiary offered free online courses during the pandemic to millions.
But in the Burning Glass analysis, Microsoft required a degree for 54 percent of its computer support job postings, compared with a national average of 24 percent. For its software quality assurance jobs, 87 percent required a college degree versus a national average of 54 percent. Microsoft required a college degree in 70 percent of its total job postings in 2021, according to Burning Glass.
Lauren Gardner, vice president of global talent acquisition for Microsoft, declined to comment on the Burning Glass analysis, other than to say many of the company’s listings specify a college degree or equivalent experience.
“We’re shifting to skills candidates possess as opposed to how they acquired them,” Ms. Gardner said. “We’re absolutely committed to broadening our hiring aperture. But it’s a journey.”

Google offers its popular skills courses free to nonprofits and community colleges and in February announced a $100 million fund to expand training and job-finding programs that focus on low-income workers, typically without a four-year college degree. Google, according to Burning Glass, has made real progress in reducing college degree requirements, from 89 percent of jobs in 2017 to 72 percent in 2021 — though that level is still high.
Google’s job postings typically list ‘bachelor’s degree” first as a qualification, sometimes followed by other requirements in, say, engineering or finance, and nearly always end with the phrase “or equivalent practical experience.”
In a statement, Brendan Castle, vice president of recruiting for Google, said, “Our focus is on demonstrated skills, and this can come through degrees or it can come through relevant experience.”
In the tech industry, work force experts point to Accenture and IBM as companies whose efforts to recruit people without a four-year degree began as corporate responsibility projects that eventually became more mainstream hiring pipelines.

That experience, they say, has influenced how the companies describe job requirements. The Burning Glass analysis found that both IBM and Accenture require college degrees in fewer than half their job postings.

Danica Lohja came to America from Serbia in 2011 with $400 and hopes for a brighter future. She started out working as a waitress at a country club, but technology seemed to be where the good jobs were. So she earned an associate degree in computer information systems at a community college in Chicago.
Ms. Lohja learned of a yearlong apprenticeship program offered by Accenture. The company hired her in 2017 and has promoted her three times. She is now an associate manager in the Accenture unit that negotiates contracts and manages the big technology services company’s hardware and software suppliers.
Ms. Lohja declined to say how much she makes. According to the job-search site Indeed, associate managers at Accenture earn more than $110,000 a year. Ms. Lohja, 35, is married to a software engineer at an insurance company. They own a home in Chicago, send their two young sons to private school and are headed to Aruba on vacation in April.

Also, don’t forget to attend the private show by Lizzo, one of the hottest pop stars in the country. If that’s not enough, the company is also planning “pop-up events” that will feature “every Googler’s favorite duo: food and swag.”
But Google employees in Boulder, Colo., were still reminded of what they were giving up when the company gave them mouse pads with the image of a sad-eyed cat. Underneath the pet was a plea: “You’re not going to RTO, right?”
R.T.O., for return to office, is an abbreviation born of the pandemic. It is a recognition of how Covid-19 forced many companies to abandon office buildings and empty cubicles. The pandemic proved that being in the office does not necessarily equal greater productivity, and some firms continued to thrive without meeting in person.
Now, after two years of video meetings and Slack chats, many companies are eager to get employees back to their desks. The employees, however, may be not be so eager for a return to morning commutes, communal bathrooms and daytime outfits that are not athletic wear.
So tech companies with money to burn and offices to fill are rolling out the fun wagon, even as they make clear that in many cases returning to the office — at least a few days a week — is mandatory.

Some see a high-water mark for inflation
Inflation in the U.S. was running at 8.5 percent in the year to March, new data showed yesterday, the highest level in more than 40 years.
Surprisingly, that brought an optimistic response from some of the economists who have spent the past year warning about price rises. “These numbers are likely to represent something of a peak,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon.
Several market watchers see signs that inflation may be subsiding, The Times’s Jeanna Smialek reports:
A surge in gas prices accounted for much of the jump in prices last month. Strip out gas and food, as many economists do, and so-called core inflation actually decelerated from February to March.
Prices for goods that have been driving inflation recently, like used cars and consumer electronics, dropped or rose less than expected, a sign that snarled supply chains could be easing.
There’s also the “base effect,” a quirk of how the numbers are reported that can affect how much inflation there appears to be. Prices really began to pop last spring, which means that after spring this year, changes will be measured against a higher year-ago number, or base.
But policymakers aren’t sitting back. New Zealand’s central bank surprised economists with a larger-than-expected half-point interest rate increase today, a move that other central banks may follow. The central bank in Canada is expected to announce a big rate increase today, and the Fed and the Bank of England will probably do the same next month. (Britain’s inflation rate hit a 30-year high in numbers released today.)

And not everyone buys the “peak inflation” narrative. The data is not definitive, with the latest prices for some categories, like furniture, rising sharply. Wages are also up, raising costs for employers and potentially prompting them to continue lifting prices (and many workers’ paychecks are still not keeping up with inflation). Pandemic shutdowns in China threaten global supply chains and the war in Ukraine adds a huge dose of uncertainty.

A subway gunman is still at large in New York. The police identified a “person of interest” in the shooting of 10 people on a Brooklyn train yesterday. He appears to have posted lengthy, bigoted rants on social media, some criticizing the policies of New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams. The Times has a live briefing with the latest developments.
JPMorgan Chase kicks off the earnings season for big banks. It slightly missed expectations for its first-quarter profit, which was down some 40 percent from the same period last year, hit by some $500 million in losses on Russian assets and other war-related market effects. Earnings are scheduled tomorrow from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.
Airlines beat Wall Street forecasts as travel rebounds. Delta reported a narrower first-quarter loss and predicted a return to profit in the second quarter. American told investors yesterday that it expected slightly higher revenue than previously forecast. Boeing also reported a rebound in sales, with strong orders for the 737 Max.
Mark Zuckerberg says he will no longer donate to local election offices. He gave nearly half a billion dollars in 2020 to shore up voting infrastructure during the pandemic. Some conservatives claimed, without evidence, that the money helped President Biden win.

Lockdowns in China could sharply cut the global demand for oil.

Can tech companies lure workers back?
Tech companies have long been leaders in giving workers the flexibility to work remotely. But they have also spent billions on lavish office spaces that they see as crucibles of collaboration and creativity. And as the pandemic eases, they are trying to shift the balance back toward the office, using both carrots and sticks.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
The industry’s appetite for office space remains strong: Meta is planning to add roughly 300,000 square feet in Manhattan, and Google announced this morning that it is investing another $9.5 billion in U.S. offices and data centers this year, especially outside California in places like Atlanta, Austin, Pittsburgh and Portland.

Tech companies want their workers to be happy about returning, so they’re offering perks, The Times’s Daisuke Wakabayashi, Erin Griffith and Kate Conger report. The pop star Lizzo will perform for Google employees this month near the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. When Microsoft reopened its office, it offered live music, beer and wine tasting, and terrarium-making classes.
But many employees are dreading a full return. In New York, yesterday’s subway attack and an overall rise in crime on trains could increase concerns about safety. According to Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford, one-third of workers he surveyed never want to go back. “Employees aren’t going to come in regularly just for the frills,” he said. The main draw is seeing colleagues.
Tech firms are making clear that in many cases returning to the office is mandatory. After several postponements, Google kicked off its hybrid work schedule April 4, requiring most employees in the U.S. at their offices a few days a week. Apple started easing staff back to the office on Monday, with workers expected once a week for now. Microsoft reopened its offices in Redmond, Wash., on a hybrid basis in late February.
“They’re not countering the pandemic. They’re creating disasters.”

A pioneering executive is leaving Goldman Sachs
Maeve DuVally, a longtime communications executive at Goldman Sachs, is retiring from the bank in June after a nearly 18-year run. DuVally is not going far — she will advise Goldman Sachs as a consultant, focusing on both corporate communications and diversity and inclusion. Her retirement comes a little more than a year after Jake Siewert, the comms chief who led the firm’s reputation makeover after the financial crisis, left for Warburg Pincus.
DuVally broke boundaries. She came out as transgender during her tenure, a move the bank supported. DuVally recently recalled her decision: “Coming out at work was probably one of the happiest days of my life, and I’ve never looked back.” The bank’s current head of comms, Andrea Williams, said in a memo announcing DuVally’s retirement that “Maeve has been an important contributor to the firm’s LGBTQ+ activities, including client events and recruiting.”
She managed some tricky stories during the financial crisis, when the bank faced a deluge of criticism for its handling of mortgage-backed securities. “Maeve has worked on some of the most challenging stories about Goldman Sachs with a focus on protecting the firm’s reputation,” Williams wrote. DuVally joined Goldman Sachs in 2004 from Merrill Lynch and became a managing director in 2010.

DeFi’s control issues
Crypto developers working in decentralized finance, or DeFi, say that their automated platforms are governed by code, not people. But their premise of hands-off decentralization is being challenged by regulators, tech experts and aggrieved investors, most recently in a proposed class action lawsuit filed in New York federal court. The suit alleges that the founders and backers of a leading decentralized exchange, Uniswap, control the protocol and are liable for “rampant fraud.”
Are decentralized exchanges actually controlled by insiders? The complaint against Uniswap Labs and the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm and Union Square Ventures accuses the groups of unlawfully selling unregistered securities and leaving investors in the dark about risks that would have to be disclosed on a traditional exchange. “They will argue there is no person behind Uniswap and that it’s decentralized,” James Serritella, the plaintiff’s attorney, told DealBook. But people write the code that controls the exchange’s operations, and its governance system is designed to favor insiders, he argued.
Regulators have signaled their interest in this issue, with the S.E.C. chair Gary Gensler suggesting that DeFi platforms are not immune from oversight. The agency is reportedly investigating Uniswap, but Serritella said that lawyers must “bring these issues to the courts” because enforcers move slowly and investors are getting hurt. “These allegations are meritless and the complaint is riddled with factual inaccuracies,” a Uniswap Labs spokeswoman said in a statement to DealBook. “We plan to vigorously defend against this suit.” Paradigm and Union Square Ventures did not immediately respond to a request for comment; Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment.

If no one controls a program, no one is responsible if things go awry. A group of global market regulators recently studied DeFi services and concluded that they mostly “replicate more traditional financial services and activities, but with weaker regulation and increased risks for investors.” This “casts doubt on a key claim of DeFi innovators that it is a peer-to-peer marketplace with no centralized insiders in control,” the regulators found. That’s akin to the complaints made by Jack Dorsey, the Bitcoin enthusiast who co-founded Twitter and now runs Block (formerly Square), who has been sparring online with Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz.

It’s a really big deal. Facilities that have thousands of employees, like Amazon warehouses, almost never succeed in unionizing. The closest example people were pointing us to was from 2008, at a slaughterhouse, where it took 15 years to organize and win that vote. Labor historians are pointing us to 1937 for the closest similar scale of a win in terms of the size, but also the prominence of the employer. It will be tied up in legal battles for a long time, but it is undoubtedly a huge thing.
Did you have to adapt as a reporter to be able to cover a labor movement?
I would say, broadly, no. Reporting is always a mix of human- and document-based sourcing. The Times made a significant investment of my and other people’s time to investigate this warehouse. Starting in the early fall of 2020, Jodi Kantor, Grace Ashford and I did an investigation looking at this one building, trying to really understand Amazon’s employment model. I was in Seattle focusing a lot on the corporate side of the decision-making, and Jodi and Grace were in New York talking with workers, trying to understand the dynamics within that particular building. We published that investigation in June of last year. So we were well-positioned as an institution to cover this election.

What was it like developing a beat on a huge company like Amazon?
Amazon historically has been almost famous for not commenting to journalists. I cover Microsoft as well, and there’s definitely a difference in tone from Microsoft, which has been through the scrutiny cycle. Amazon has been opening up more, though it’s not their default, I would say.
For sourcing, you just report. You try to talk to people who work there. You ask, “Who else should I talk to you?” You talk to outside parties; you try to talk to inside parties.
I read a lot of the work from other reporters who are watching Amazon to stay up-to-date on stuff that I’m not actively reporting on. Sometimes I’ll learn things reporting and maybe six months later there’s a nugget that resonates. All of a sudden, it’s a good moment to write about Amazon.
How do employees react when you reach out, and how do you explain what you’re trying to do?
If it’s me trying to reach someone cold, it’s a low success rate, but it’s not zero. I say, “I’m here in Seattle, and I care about creating an informed public dialogue about this company.” People are more free to talk when they leave, but Amazon moves very quickly and their firsthand knowledge can become obsolete quickly. That’s a challenge.
Given Amazon’s vast reach across America’s society and economy, I imagine there are few things you can’t find an Amazon angle into. How do you view that challenge as a reporter?

There is opportunity everywhere to report. That is a great part of the beat. The most important thing with an expansive beat is picking what to focus on and how to allocate our time. In our coverage coming out of the pandemic, we really thought that Amazon’s growth as an employer was one of the critical things for the business, and a critical thing for society. We really devoted a lot of time to that."

2022-04-17,"In a recent conversation with a colleague, the topic of Zoom came up, and I pointed out that the advantage of socializing with friends on video is the ability to simply say goodbye and X out of the conversation — no need for lingering or superfluous pleasantries. My colleague laughed and remarked: “Even better: Stay on a free Zoom trial! This way, it kicks you off after 40 minutes, regardless of what is happening.”
And she’s right: Pandemic-era socializing can be incredibly efficient. But maybe — hear me out — efficiency shouldn’t be the main goal when it comes to friendship? Intimate relationships take time to build and their benefits are not measurable, at least not in immediate and quantifiable ways.
Even before Covid, a stark and disconcerting trend was underway: a decline in meaningful relationships and a rise in social isolation. A 2019 survey found that a whopping 61 percent of Americans reported feeling lonely. Making friends as an adult is difficult, and research published in 2020 in the journal Personality and Individual Differences offers some clues as to why: Among the top reasons adults have an especially hard time making friends is that they are less likely to trust new people — and because they say they don’t have time.
Though there are many factors underlying what Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has called the “loneliness epidemic,” I lay the blame for some of it on our collective obsession with optimization and efficiency. This obsession has gotten worse since the pandemic began — with a recent study by Microsoft suggesting that knowledge workers are doing much more work in the evenings and on average logging an hour more work per day overall.

It’s not just that extra work leaves us less time for socializing. In the age of Covid and social distancing, we have become, by necessity, risk-averse. As the boundaries between work and life have blurred, we’ve said no to social invitations to protect our time, as well as our mental and physical health; we’ve cut people out of our lives who hurt us or bring us down; and we’ve prioritized family and our closest friends over casual acquaintances.

No doubt, there are some real benefits to this shrinkage of our social circles, and perhaps even in the culling of certain relationships. Saying yes to everyone and everything, and overextending ourselves in the process may be a good habit to shed. Many of us during the pandemic have embraced solitary joys such as reading or gardening, and that is all well and good."

And now, a word from your streaming sponsor…
Later today, Netflix will report its latest quarterly earnings. Analysts do not have high expectations. The streaming service’s profits are expected to drop by more than 20 percent.
In January, Netflix surprised investors when it said that its growth, which accelerated during the pandemic, was set to slow dramatically. The Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler wrote in a note to clients yesterday that Netflix was facing a number of challenges, including higher content costs, increased competition and the possibility that the U.S. has hit its streaming-subscription saturation point. This is not just a problem for Netflix.
Streaming video services have been struggling to sign up new subscribers. To reach more people, including those grappling with rising inflation and subscription overload, some streamers are offering a deal: They will lower prices in exchange for showing ads amid their programming, The Times’s John Koblin and Tiffany Hsu report.

Netflix and other streamers once shunned ads, but that stance is now in flux:
Netflix is no longer dismissing the possibility of a lower-price, ad-supported option. “Never say never,” Spencer Neumann, Netflix’s C.F.O., said last month.
Disney+ will begin offering an ad-supported subscription, for a reduced fee, this year.
HBO Max began showing ads on its service last summer and said it had not lost premium subscriptions to the ad-supported alternative.
Amazon doubled down on its free, advertising-supported streaming service last week, renaming it Freevee, from IMDb TV, and expanding its programming budget.
Other streamers, like Hulu, Paramount+ and Peacock, have been offering ad-supported services for a while.
Consumers “need advertising-supported models so that they can balance their bank accounts,” said Kelly Metz of Omnicom Media Group. “There’s a ceiling on what the U.S. consumer can practically afford, just like what we saw back in the day with cable television.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Apollo is considering joining a bid for Twitter. The private equity firm may offer debt financing to potential buyers, including Elon Musk, who is locked in a battle with Twitter’s board over his $40 billion-plus bid. Meanwhile, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and former C.E.O., criticized “dysfunction” on the company’s board, where he remains a member.
Amazon will audit its workplace practices for racial bias. The e-commerce giant, under pressure from shareholders, said it hired Loretta Lynch, the former U.S. attorney general, to lead the audit. This comes as a judge ordered Amazon to rehire Gerald Bryson, whom it fired two years ago after he protested safety conditions at a warehouse in Staten Island, the same one that recently voted to unionize.
Mask mandates are falling. The largest airlines and Amtrak dropped mask requirements yesterday after a federal judge in Florida struck down a mandate on public transport, a ruling the Biden administration may appeal. Today, Uber also dropped its mask requirement, but said riders can cancel trips if they feel uncomfortable.
The outlook for the global economy dims. The World Bank yesterday said the global economy would grow 3.2 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 4.1 percent. (The I.M.F. will update its forecasts later this morning.) Meanwhile, China announced a series of measures to boost economic growth, after data showed a significant drop in consumer spending amid pandemic lockdowns.

Tesla claims to be caught in an agency turf war
The electric vehicle maker Tesla yesterday challenged an investigation into alleged racial discrimination at its factory in California. It argued that the state’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing is “exceeding its boundaries” to advance a turf war with federal authorities. Tesla’s lawyers asked a California court to stay the state’s case against the company.
Tesla’s action comes at a trying time for California’s anti-discrimination agency. The D.F.E.H. is reeling from the recent departure of two top lawyers amid disagreements over its gender discrimination case against the video game company Activision Blizzard, which is expected to merge with Microsoft in a $70 billion deal. The agency’s chief counsel, Janette Wipper, was terminated late last month — unjustly, she argues — and the assistant chief counsel, Melanie Proctor, resigned last week, accusing Gov. Gavin Newsom of California of trying to interfere with the case on behalf of the company. The termination came shortly after Activision Blizzard settled a case with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a deal that D.F.E.H. unsuccessfully tried to stay as its own claims were pending.

The state’s authorities have been sparring with their federal counterparts, and Tesla said it is caught in the crossfire. The company’s lawyers argue that D.F.E.H. is skipping procedural steps and rushing to file lawsuits against companies to grab power from the E.E.O.C. They accused the state agency of “abruptly” advancing its investigation in January “shortly after the federal court in the Activision Blizzard matter issued its order rebuking D.F.E.H. and denying its motion to intervene.” Tesla’s lawyers also said that the California agency demanded that the company “agree to a gag order” and tried to stop it from negotiating a settlement with the E.E.O.C. or others.

Will the Activision Blizzard mess taint the California agency’s credibility in its case against Tesla? Kevin Kish, the director of the D.F.E.H., declined to comment on internal personnel matters, writing in a statement to DealBook: “In recent years, under this administration and my leadership, D.F.E.H. has litigated groundbreaking cases that are a model of effective government enforcement of civil rights. We continue to do so with the full support of the administration.”

Businesses resist merger rule rewrite
Antitrust regulators began the year by announcing plans to rewrite merger guidelines — and now businesses are pushing back.

DealBook got a first look at a letter to the F.T.C. and Justice Department being filed today by more than a dozen trade associations, including the Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In response to the government’s request for comment on a potential rethink of merger enforcement, the trade groups argue that a sweeping rewrite would be “misguided.”
“Mergers are a vital part of our economy,” said Sean Heather of the Chamber’s antitrust division. “The government should not inject uncertainty into merger reviews or make mergers unduly difficult. Doing so would harm consumers and American competitiveness.” Nearly 4,500 other commenters have weighed in so far, and many take the opposite view, in part because progressive activists have been rallying the public in favor of tougher antitrust enforcement.
“Abandon an unconstrained approach to merger law,” the trade groups wrote. They said that the agencies’ plans are based on false assumptions about overconcentration. The trade groups cite a 2020 report from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers rejecting research that found business to be too consolidated. But that was a different administration with a very different take on the data.

Billie Jean King invests in women
High-profile backers are starting a new incubator to support start-ups focused on women in sports, DealBook is first to report. The Trailblazer Venture studio, by R/GA Ventures, the venture capital firm Elysian Park, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Billie Jean King Enterprises, comes as female athletes and women’s leagues are seeing an influx of investment, although this still pales in comparison with men’s sports. “There is starting to become that tipping point that I’ve been praying for forever,” Billie Jean King told DealBook.
King has been fighting for equality — and funds — for a long time. “The one thing I learned at a very young age,” the tennis star and social activist said, is “if I want any of these things to happen, it’s going to take money.” She saw firsthand the lack of resources and attention that women got compared with men in sports. “The reason people get very excited about men’s sports is that they’re constantly seeing them, they’re constantly hearing about them, they know their stories,” King said. “The only way you really are powerful is when people know who you are.”
How the new venture works: Trailblazer is a three-month program with four to six start-ups. Investments can range from $200,000 to $2 million. Elysian Park will be the main investor, R/GA will offer its branding expertise and King’s company will offer its relationships. “Everybody needs help and access to things that can really scale and make a difference,” said Ilana Kloss, the C.E.O. of Billie Jean King Enterprises. It’s not enough to say, “if you’re good enough, you’re going to make it,” she said.
Start-ups in the program range in focus from health to nutrition to fandom. “It’s not necessarily ‘By women, for women,’” said Fielding Jamieson of R/GA, who will run the Trailblazer Venture studio. “It’s more, ‘Let me just build a product that is equal across both male and female.’”

2022-04-20,"In the days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the German software giant SAP halted all its sales in Russia. But it provoked the ire of Ukrainian leaders by continuing to offer updates and cloud computing access to Russian customers not targeted by Western sanctions.
This week SAP, which makes business software to handle tasks like logistics and accounting, announced that it was taking the final steps toward an “orderly exit” from its operations in Russia, a process it said had been made more difficult by its concern for employees and Russian laws that prohibited unilaterally quitting contracts.
“We’re not in the consumer business — we sell very complex software solutions,” said Luka Mucic, SAP’s chief financial officer, explaining what he called the “significant complexity” of winding down three decades of business in the country.
SAP’s statement went further than its previous announcements since the invasion, noting its “intent” to stop supporting and maintaining its products. The pullout could erode back-office computer operations at many Russian companies, including state-owned Sberbank, Russia’s biggest financial institution. In 2018, SAP created what it called “Russia’s largest cloud project” to manage Sberbank’s 230,000 employees.
SAP’s planned exit follows that of other German companies like Henkel, maker of household cleaning and hair care products, the network provider Deutsche Telekom and the Obi home improvement chain. Still, others remain in Russia and face difficult decisions as the war stretches into its next phase.
Among them is the automotive supplier Continental, which said Wednesday that it was forced to temporarily restart production at its tire plant in Kaluga, outside Moscow.

2022-04-22,"In just the last few years, Europe has seen a sweeping law for online privacy take effect, approved far-reaching regulations to curb the dominance of the tech giants and on Saturday reached a deal on new legislation to protect its citizens from harmful online content.
For those keeping score, that’s Europe: three. United States: zero.
The United States may be the birthplace of the iPhone and the most widely used search engine and social network, and it could also bring the world into the so-called metaverse. But global leadership on tech regulations is taking place more than 3,000 miles from Washington, by European leaders representing 27 nations with 24 languages, who have nonetheless been able to agree on basic online protections for their 450 million or so citizens.
In the United States, Congress has not passed a single piece of comprehensive regulation to protect internet consumers and to rein in the power of its technology giants.
It’s not for lack of trying. Over 25 years, dozens of federal privacy bills have been proposed and then ultimately dropped without bipartisan support. With every major hack of a bank or retailer, lawmakers have introduced data breach and security bills, all of which have withered on the vine. A flurry of speech bills have sunk into the quicksand of partisan disagreements over freedoms of expression. And antitrust bills to curtail the power of Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, have sat in limbo amid fierce lobbying opposition.
Only two narrow federal tech laws have been enacted — one for children’s privacy and the other for ridding sites of sex-trafficking content — in the past 25 years.
“Inertia is too kind of a word to describe what’s happened in the United States; there’s been a lack of will, courage and understanding of the problem and technologies,” said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a public interest group. “And consumers are left with no protections here and lots of confusion.”

What’s Up? (April 17-23)
A Bad Week for CNN+ and Netflix
After pouring tens of millions of dollars into a nationwide marketing campaign, big-name stars and hundreds of new employees, CNN announced Thursday it was shutting down CNN+, its weeks-old streaming platform. Executives at Discovery, CNN’s new owner, were said to be concerned about underwhelming interest from subscribers. The news fueled questions — particularly after Netflix’s disastrous earnings report last week — about the longer-term outlook for streaming services. Netflix said on Tuesday that it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter and expected some two million more to leave the platform over the next three months. It was the first time in a decade the company lost subscribers, and its shares plunged 35 percent.
Florida Takes On the Magic Kingdom
Escalating its tangle with Disney World, Florida lawmakers advanced a measure to strip the theme park of a privilege that has allowed it to effectively self-govern its vast property in the state for more than 50 years. Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers of the legislature, were spurred on by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who cleared a path for the lawmakers to vote on bills that would eliminate special tax districts created before 1968. He signed the legislation on Friday. The move is widely seen as retaliation for Disney’s opposition to what some call the “Don’t Say Gay” law, which limits instruction on gender and sexuality in some elementary school grades.
Masks Drop on Public Transportation
Many of the country’s major airlines dropped their mask mandates after a federal judge appointed during the Trump administration struck down the requirement for airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation. Airlines including American, Delta and United, which have had to deal with unruly passengers who refused to comply with the mandate, swiftly announced they were no longer requiring masks, and Delta later said it would allow people who were placed on its no-fly list for defying its previous mask policy to fly once again.  The Biden administration said it would appeal the ruling.

What’s Next? (April 24-30)
An Economic Slowdown
The gross domestic product report for the first quarter, which will be released on Thursday, is expected to show that economic growth in the United States slowed significantly in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is partly because of the Omicron wave, which kept many Americans at home in January and disrupted service industries and manufacturing. The report will also help show to what extent inflation — which reached 8.5 percent last month — may be holding back consumers as well as the broader economy. The G.D.P. data from the last quarter of 2021 illustrated how inflation can obscure how much of the country’s economy is recovering from the depths of the pandemic. Output in the United States still had not caught up to prepandemic levels, last quarter’s report showed, because consumers’ dollars are worth less than before.

Elon Musk’s Money Moves
Twitter is releasing its quarterly earnings report this week, and a significant part will probably deal with Elon Musk’s determined efforts to acquire the company and give investors an idea about whether his offer is sufficient. In an attempt to make the company’s board take his offer more seriously, Mr. Musk said on Thursday in a federal filing that he had commitments worth $46.5 billion — a mix of debt and cash — to finance his bid.  The documents also showed that Mr. Musk was considering a hostile takeover, which would involve bringing the bid directly to shareholders. Twitter’s board has already made provisions to thwart such a move, adopting a so-called poison pill that would block Mr. Musk from buying an unlimited number of Twitter shares.
A Big Bet on Gaming
Activision Blizzard shareholders will vote Thursday on whether to merge with Microsoft. For Microsoft, which announced in January that it wanted to acquire the video game company for almost $70 billion, the deal would serve at least two major purposes: In the long term, it plants a flag in the metaverse, the virtual world where tech companies like Facebook are placing big bets.  In the shorter term, the acquisition helps Microsoft get ahead of its rival Sony in the race for gamers’ attention and dollars and keeps the company competitive with Amazon and Google, which have also entered the gaming market. If Activision shareholders approve the deal — and they are likely to do so — it still faces the scrutiny of antitrust regulators.
What Else?

Chasing the bird
What seemed highly improbable a week and a half ago is now looking a lot more real: Twitter is in advanced talks to sell itself to Elon Musk. The company’s 11-member board was negotiating with Musk into the early hours of the morning over his offer to buy the social networking service and take it private, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and The Times’s Mike Isaac report.
The two sides have been discussing details, including a timeline to close any potential deal and any fees that would be paid if an agreement were signed and then fell apart, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The negotiations followed a board meeting yesterday morning to discuss the offer. No deal is certain, and it remains entirely possible that the talks will break down. It is rare for a board to try to hammer through a deal as quickly as this.
Through it all, Musk kept tweeting. Musk took aim at Bill Gates over the weekend, saying Gates had taken a short position in Tesla’s stock, betting that it would fall. Musk was responding to a tweet that included texts he apparently exchanged with Gates about potential philanthropic projects. Minutes later, he mocked Gates’s physical appearance in a tweet that got 1.1 million “likes.” Yesterday, before his meeting with Twitter’s board, Musk tweeted that he was “moving on” from “making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action.”

The tweets may be a glimpse at how Twitter would run under Musk’s ownership. Critics say they were just the latest example of Musk using the platform, and his enormous following on it, as a bully pulpit, whether directed at billionaires or others. Musk has said he wants Twitter to fulfill its “societal imperative” as a platform for free speech. But as DealBook has reported, that raises real questions of what might happen to Twitter under his watch, given the tone he is setting and the problems that plagued the network’s previous C.E.O., Jack Dorsey, before he embraced a more rules-based approach to content moderation. Dorsey had said that he “didn’t fully predict or understand the real-world negative consequences” of a more unfettered service. To what extent will Twitter’s board weigh the potential for more “real-world negative consequences” against the money put forward by Musk?

Emmanuel Macron comfortably holds off France’s far right. Marine Le Pen yesterday conceded to Macron, the first French president to be re-elected in 20 years, after he won 58.5 percent of the vote to Le Pen’s 41.5 percent.

Chinese authorities order mass Covid testing in Beijing. As the coronavirus spreads in an affluent district of the capital, residents are waiting in long lines for tests and rushing to supermarkets to stock up on food in case the city goes into another lockdown.
Tech giants including Apple, Amazon and Microsoft report earnings this week. The quarterly updates will come after stocks tumbled last week for a third week; Friday was the S&P 500’s worst day since early March. Recent comments from Fed officials have signaled that interest rates will climb far faster than previously expected because of persistently high inflation.
The National Labor Relations Board sues Starbucks for retaliating against union organizers.

Disney and free speech
Florida’s rushed passage last week of a bill revoking Walt Disney World’s special tax status, just days after Gov. Ron DeSantis called for such a move, may look to some like a swift governmental victory. But it could end up being a political liability if it ends up burdening local taxpayers or fails a legal challenge.
The conflict was sparked when Disney objected to a Florida law prohibiting discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in public-school classrooms. Disney has not yet commented on the state’s extraordinary response. But if the company sues, the legislature’s actions could be found unconstitutional, precisely because DeSantis has been so vocal in his opposition to Disney.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Corporations are people too. For more than 50 years, Disney has run the Reedy Creek Improvement District independently and received special benefits. The repeal would end Disney’s special status in 2023, but many lawyers and free speech advocates say Florida could lose a constitutional challenge — if Disney can prove this was retribution for political speech. As “artificial persons,” companies have long had constitutional rights. At the bill signing on Friday, DeSantis referenced Disney’s position on the education law, calling it a “provocation” and vowing to “fight back.” While Disney isn’t entitled to its special district, retracting the benefit in order to punish the company for political protest appears to violate the First Amendment.

But proving retribution may not be easy. Despite DeSantis’s evident feud with Disney, the company could have trouble showing that other lawmakers were motivated by the intent to punish political speech and would not have approved the bill but for Disney’s protest. Also, because the benefits in question are unique to Disney, this particular case may get complicated and enter uncharted constitutional territory.
Democrats and Republicans are switching sides. The ideological left and right are now taking new angles in an old fight. In 2010, when the Supreme Court decided Citizens United, a case that removed limits on corporate political spending, Democrats protested that companies would have undue political influence, while Republicans cheered corporate freedoms. Now, many conservatives are angered by companies speaking up on political issues, while progressives have become the unlikely defenders of business.

Warren Buffett and climate activists are likely to square off again.

Buffett’s climate problem
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway will hold its annual meeting next weekend. It will be the first time since the start of the pandemic that the billionaire investor has gathered his shareholders and legion of fans in person at what is often called “Woodstock for Capitalists.” At the meeting, Buffett will, once again, face a shareholder proposal calling on Berkshire to overhaul how it views climate risks and do more to cut emissions, reports The Times’s Peter Eavis.
The proposal is unlikely to pass. Though Buffett has backed other progressive causes, he has long opposed efforts to get Berkshire to disclose more about its carbon footprint or climate risks. Buffett holds special shares that give him the power to veto proposals he doesn’t like. Still, a vote on a similar proposal last year was close, and a number of Buffett allies, including Bill Gates, are also facing increased pressure to take stronger stands on climate change.
Buffett argues that his company already discloses plenty of climate information. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, one of the nation’s largest producers of wind energy, does report emissions data. But Berkshire does not reveal its overall climate impact. Buffett has refused to put a number on Berkshire’s financial exposure to climate change, which is likely to be enormous given that it is one of the largest property and casualty insurers in the world.
Berkshire’s energy subsidiary has weaker emission targets than some of its peers. Berkshire Hathaway Energy uses looser language than many other utilities, saying it is “striving to achieve net zero” but how fast it gets there will depend on customers, regulators and technology. Rivals like Xcel Energy and Duke Energy have said they are committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with no caveats.

Data delayed at least 15 minutesSource: FactSetBy: Ella Koeze
Stocks slid on Tuesday, adding to a losing streak that has April shaping up to be Wall Street’s worst month in two years.
The S&P 500 fell 2.8 percent, bringing its losses for the month to 7.8 percent. The index is on track for its worst monthly decline since March 2020, when stocks plunged 12.5 percent as the coronavirus spread around the world, prompting lockdowns and halting economic activity.
The steady drop — with only six days of gains in April — has come as investors have confronted a long list of fears: that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates far more quickly than economists had anticipated; that rising prices and wages could erode corporate profits; and that renewed lockdowns in China could become another drag on the global economy.
Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund projected global growth would slow this year to 3.6 percent, from 6.1 percent in 2021. That was before a new Covid outbreak in Beijing raised concerns about more restrictions in China, the world’s second-largest economy, where cities like Shanghai have already been under lockdown for weeks.
“China slows down the rest of the world if it shuts down,” said Victoria Greene, the chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm. “If China shuts down, that could shut down commerce, and that slows down overall global demand.”
On Tuesday, technology stocks led the retreat on Wall Street, ahead of earnings reports from Alphabet, Microsoft and — later in the week — Meta, Amazon and Apple. Shares of all five companies were lower. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted toward tech, fell about 4 percent.

The energy war escalates
Russia lashed out at mounting Western arms shipments and economic penalties by cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, signaling a new phase in the war in which oil and gas supplies are a key part of the battleground.
Since the beginning of the conflict, the U.S. and its allies have attempted to punish Russia while avoiding too much damage to countries like Germany, which still depend on Russian oil and gas. As this newsletter noted last month, Russia needs revenue from oil and gas sales to fund its invasion in Ukraine, while its opponents are vulnerable to price spikes and energy shortages.

Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called the gas shut-off “a direct attack.” Poland has been a prime conduit for arms shipments to Ukraine and is sheltering millions of Ukrainian refugees.
Gas prices surged after the cutoff, but the immediate economic impact of the move was limited. Poland has worked for at least a decade to avoid being held ransom by Moscow. Bulgaria, which said Russia was using its gas supplies “as a political and economic weapon,” is more dependent on Russian gas, but it received a pledge of assistance from Greece.
The shut-off serves as a warning of more serious potential gas cutoffs as the war grinds on. It came a day after Germany, which still relies heavily on Russian energy supplies, announced that it would supply its first heavy weapons to Ukraine since the war began.
Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said today that a sudden halt of Russian gas, which accounts for 35 percent of the country’s supplies, would trigger a recession for Europe’s largest economy. He also said Germany is prepared to seize control of a refinery mostly owned by the Russian energy company Rosneft, which could set the stage for a European Union embargo of Russian oil.
This month, the E.U. approved a ban on Russian coal in response to atrocities that Russian troops carried out in the Ukrainian suburb of Bucha. The U.S., Britain and Canada have already stopped importing oil from Russia, the world’s third-largest producer after the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.

The Ukrainian village of Demydiv has about 750 households, of which roughly 50 were flooded.
Flooding a village to keep Russia at bay
The residents of Demydiv, a village north of Kyiv, have been grappling with the aftermath of a severe flood. And they couldn’t be more pleased.
The Ukrainians flooded the village intentionally, along with a vast expanse of fields and bogs around it, creating a quagmire that thwarted a Russian tank assault on Kyiv and bought Ukraine’s army precious time to prepare defenses, my colleague Andrew E. Kramer reports, with photographs and video by David Guttenfelder.

“Everybody understands and nobody regrets it for a moment,” said Antonina Kostuchenko, a retiree, whose living room is now a musty space with waterlines a foot or so up the walls.
“We saved Kyiv!” she said with pride.
Since the war’s early days, Ukraine has been swift and effective in wreaking havoc on its own territory as a way to foil a Russian army with superior numbers and weaponry.
Demydiv was flooded when troops opened a nearby dam and sent water surging into the countryside. Elsewhere in Ukraine, the military has, without hesitation, blown up bridges, bombed roads and disabled rail lines and airports. The goal has been to slow Russian advances, channel enemy troops into traps and force tank columns onto less favorable terrain.

2022-04-28,"After a year of blistering sales growth, Apple showed that it has a more resilient business than many of its tech peers, even though it cooled off in the first three months of the year.
The company reported on Thursday that profit rose 6 percent to $25 billion in its second fiscal quarter, a slowdown from the double-digit growth in each of the previous five quarters. Sales increased 9 percent to $97.29 billion, exceeding analysts’ expectations, as pandemic-fueled purchases of iPads and Macs slowed from a year earlier.
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, cautioned investors about the months ahead, telling Wall Street analysts that an accelerating Covid outbreak in China will curtail demand and impair production of iPhones, iPads and Macs. He said the supply-chain troubles are expected to reduce sales in the current quarter by $4 billion to $8 billion.
“I think we’re doing a reasonable job currently navigating what is a challenging environment,” Mr. Cook said, noting that “almost all” of the factories Apple relies on in the Shanghai region have restarted production.

The company’s shares fell about 4 percent in after-hours trading, giving up much of Apple’s gains earlier in the day.
The results added to a week of uneven financial reports from leading technology companies that have struggled to sustain last year’s explosive growth. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook’s parent, Meta, had reported profit declines from a year earlier, while Microsoft posted an increase in profit.
The pandemic has been a double-edged sword for Apple. Remote school and work spurred demand for computing equipment, and government stimulus checks and cutbacks in travel and leisure spending provided a jolt to the company’s all-important iPhone business, analysts said. But those same forces sowed supply-chain problems, triggering a global chip shortage that has cost Apple billions of dollars in missed sales.
In addition to highlighting the challenges it faces in China, Apple said total revenue in the current quarter will be crimped by its decision to stop selling products in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. Apple counts on Russia for 1 percent of its sales and a slightly larger percentage of its profit, analysts estimate.
During the January-to-March quarter, sales of iPhones, iPads and other devices rose 6.6 percent to $77.5 billion, Apple said.

The bigger problem for Apple may come in the months ahead as economic strains from the war in Ukraine spill into Europe, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and managing partner at the venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. “People are on edge,” he said. “They’re paying more for fuel. If you live in Germany, does that affect your decision to buy the next iPhone?”
To diversify beyond device sales, Mr. Cook has pushed an increasing array of software and services across Apple products worldwide. Last year, people sequestered at home splurged on apps, video games and subscriptions such as HBO Max. But amid the return to work and school, Apple said, sales growth in its so-called services business slowed, recording $19.82 billion in revenue during the quarter.
The company said it would increase its cash dividend to shareholders by 5 percent and increase its share repurchases by $90 billion."

Why Elon Musk Thinks Your Attention Is Worth $44 Billion
The Twitter bid is a power play in the attention economy.

EZRA KLEIN: I’m Ezra Klein. This is “The Ezra Klein Show.”
[MUSIC PLAYING]
So I’m recording this Thursday, April 28. As of today, it’s been a wild week. Elon Musk is poised to buy Twitter in a roughly $44 billion deal. If the sale completes, the world’s richest person is going to own one of the most important communications platforms there is, a platform that shapes narratives in politics, in media, in finance, in technology, and so much more.
You may not care about Twitter or use it. I know many of you don’t. I admire that. But what happens there affects you anyway. I’d argue that Donald Trump rode his Twitter account to the presidency, and of course, used his Twitter account very aggressively throughout his presidency. It was, arguably, his main communication channel. So things that happened there end up affecting the whole world, whether or not the rest of the world wants to be there.
What makes Twitter powerful is attention. It’s a very liquid market for attention. And I’ve been interested for a long time in the economics of attention and how they’re changing. The classic analysis of this is that when information becomes abundant, as it has become in our era, it is attention that becomes scarce. And thus, attention that becomes really valuable. And attention is what Twitter manages and trades in, particularly the attention of elites and really key industries."
2022-04-30,"Berkshire Hathaway, the insurance and investing conglomerate that is run by the billionaire and investment legend Warren E. Buffett, reported on Saturday a significant drop in earnings in the first quarter.
Profits at the company, which owns a diverse array of American brands from the car insurer Geico to the ice cream chain Dairy Queen, fell to $5.4 billion. That was down 53 percent from the nearly $12 billion that it earned in the same three months a year ago. Those profits were also lower than the $6 billion that analysts had expected the company would earn in the quarter.
Much of the drop, though, was driven by Berkshire’s large stock portfolio, which lost nearly $1.6 billion in the first three months of the year, down from a gain of nearly $5 billion in the first quarter of 2021. That drop mirrored the performance of the stock market in general, which had its worst month in two years in April, and has been dragged down by investors’ fears about rising inflation and uncertainty caused by the Ukrainian war and the pandemic’s lingering impact on global supply chains.
The earnings report came out as the company was holding its annual meeting in person for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Mr. Buffett said on Saturday at the meeting that Berkshire had been buying shares of the video game company Activision Blizzard since Microsoft announced its plans to buy Activision on Jan. 18 and now holds a 9.5 percent stake in the company.

The company’s financial filings also showed that Berkshire had dramatically increased its investment in the oil company giant Chevron to nearly $26 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from just $4.5 billion at the end of 2021. That made Chevron Berkshire’s fourth largest holding, behind Apple, Bank of America and American Express. Mr. Buffett has recently been making big bets on the energy sector. Last month, the company also bought $7 billion in shares of Occidental Petroleum.
Sales and profits at Berkshire’s operating businesses continued to rise in the quarter, bucking the overall contraction in the U.S. economy in the first quarter. Economists said, though, that the drop in gross domestic product hid some underlying strength in the U.S. economy, and Berkshire’s operating results seemed to back that up. Profits at Berkshire's manufacturing and retail businesses rose 16 percent from the same period a year ago. Profits at its railroad company Burlington Northern, one of the largest freight networks in the United States, were up 9 percent, again reflecting continued business activity.
Berkshire’s mixed first-quarter results came as tens of thousands of Mr. Buffett’s loyal investors flocked to Omaha, his hometown, for the company’s annual meeting. The Buffett-fest is a daylong folksy affair, often called “Woodstock for Capitalists,” in which Mr. Buffett spends hours answering questions in front of a crowd in the city’s downtown 17,000-seat arena. While there were some empty seats, several corporate notables were there, among them Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, as well as Bill Ackman, the head of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, and the actor Bill Murray.

A giant conference room floor was filled with booths highlighting Berkshire’s many companies, and offering discounts on things like boxes of See’s Candies, also owned by Berkshire. Mr. Buffett said on Saturday from the stage that See’s had brought 11 tons of candy to the shareholder meeting, and expected to sell out. Only shareholders can attend in person. The meeting has been virtual for the past two years.
Mr. Buffett, in fielding shareholder questions at the meeting, was critical of Wall Street. He said the stock market resembled “a gambling parlor” in recent years, adding that the speculative behavior was “encouraged by Wall Street.”

Mr. Buffett, 91, faces a slightly more contentious annual meeting than usual, despite the fact that Berkshire’s shares, up nearly 8 percent this year, have outperformed the overall market, which is down 13 percent. “Historically, Berkshire shares have outperformed during periods of economic distress as investors made a ‘flight to quality,’” Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who follows Berkshire, wrote in a note to clients this past week.
Dissident shareholders put up a proposal asking Berkshire to overhaul how it views and details its climate risk, something Mr. Buffett has resisted doing. They say Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which manages a number of large utilities, has lagged rivals in setting plans to lower its emissions of carbon dioxide. The climate proposal last year had the support of many larger shareholders outside of Mr. Buffett’s inner circle, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.
What’s more, a number of large investors, including the giant California Public Employees Retirement Fund, backed a shareholder proposal that sought to remove Mr. Buffett, who is currently both chief executive and chairman of the company’s board of directors, from his chair role. That proposal is one that larger investors have floated at other companies as well, arguing that splitting the roles is better corporate governance.
Mr. Buffett opposed the proposals and they failed on Saturday. Because he has a large number of votes, proposals Mr. Buffett opposes are typically defeated.
When responding to the climate proposal on Saturday, he once again emphasized that Berkshire Hathaway Energy was making big investments in renewable energy projects. But those behind the proposal said they wanted Berkshire to make climate disclosures for the whole company, not just parts of the conglomerate. “What we are asking for is a composite picture,” said Timothy Youmans, an executive at EOS at Federated Hermes in North America, which was a sponsor of the climate proposal.

Consumers are bracing for higher prices for gas and other goods.

A rate increase… and then what?
The Federal Reserve is meeting this week. The economy is running hot, and the Fed is trying to slow it down before widespread price pressures become even more of a problem. It lifted interest rates in March for the first time since 2018, by a quarter of a percentage point, and has set the stage for an even larger increase of half a percentage point this week. The announcement is expected to come at the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon.
But while the rate decision is unlikely to be a surprise, economists and investors will want to know how the Fed plans to move forward at a time when inflation is rising faster than it has in decades. The recent performance of the stock market, which in April took its biggest monthly dive in two years, is hinting at economic trouble ahead, and is the latest complication in the Fed’s fight against inflation.
The outlook for inflation is wildly uncertain, report The Times’s Jeanna Smialek and Ben Casselman. On one hand, the Fed’s small rate increase has already pushed mortgage rates sharply higher, which may start to weigh on the housing market and cool off related types of demand. Nonetheless, costs for raw materials and other key inputs continue to climb, and may keep doing so amid the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. Already, some companies, like the washing-machine maker Whirlpool, are seeing consumer demand wane compared with last year, though it is still higher than before the pandemic. “Historic levels of inflation, notably in raw materials, energy and logistics, will impact us throughout the year,” James W. Peters, Whirlpool’s chief financial officer, said last week in a conference call.
Americans have been feeling the pain of higher prices, even if they are spending through it. A record share of people in a Gallup poll named inflation as the top U.S. economic problem, survey data released last week showed. Officials spent much of 2021 hoping that pandemic-era cost increases would fade as supply chains returned to normal. Instead, inflation has remained too high for the Fed’s comfort for a year, and it has become broader with time. A higher-than-expected jump in wage data released Friday made a second big increase in June more likely “at the margin,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

At the same time, the stock market has had a bad year. The Fed has long said it doesn’t make decisions based on the market, but clearly the recent stock rout makes raising interest rates harder. The S&P 500 fell 8.8 percent in April, and is down more than 13 percent in 2022. The drop shows many investors are coming to the same conclusion: The economy is about to take a hit, and everywhere they look, they see trouble ahead, reports The Times’s Coral Murphy Marcos. “There are definitely a lot of open-ended and unquantified risks looming,” said Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm.

The E.U. will propose phasing out Russian oil by the end of the year. Restrictions on imports would be introduced gradually under the proposed plan. A decision about new sanctions could come as soon as this week.

Warren Buffett, 91, and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger, 98, lobbed quips and retorts over the course of more than six hours onstage at what some call “Woodstock for Capitalists,” speaking and fielding questions. In the audience were Tim Cook, Jamie Dimon, Bill Gates, Bill Ackman, Mario Gabelli, Bill Murray and Glenn Close. Ken Chenault was there as a first-time board member.
The big difference this year was the presence of Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, Buffett’s successors, who sat on the dais with him and Munger for the first time. Jain was particularly Buffett-like in the straightforward and analytical way he answered questions, at one point admitting that Geico, the car insurer owned by Berkshire, had underperformed its rival Progressive, and explaining why.
The biggest news was likely that Buffett was arbitraging the Activision deal with Microsoft, betting it will happen, and had significantly increased his bet on the oil industry by buying more shares of the energy giant Chevron in the first quarter.
Here are some of the meeting’s best lines:
“Inflation swindles the bond investor too. It swindles the person who keeps their cash under their mattress. It swindles almost everybody,” Buffett said.
“If you told me you owned all the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn’t take it,” Buffett said. “Whether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don’t know. But the one thing I’m pretty sure of is that it doesn’t produce anything.”
“I try to avoid things that are stupid and evil and make me look bad. Bitcoin does all three,” Munger added.
“If I were running oil and gas for the U.S., I would leave most of the oil we have here and pay whatever the Arabs charge for their oil and conserve my own,” Munger said. “I think it’s going to be very precious stuff over the next 200 years.”
“You ought to be a better person in the second half of your life than the first half,” Buffett said.
“In December, Wood described ARKK portfolio as in ‘deep value’ territory and sent value investors worldwide into spasms of indignation. ARKK’s down another 50% since then, so deeper value-er, I guess.”

Musk tears up the financing playbook
Elon Musk’s financing plan for his buyout of Twitter has broken all the rules. He is putting up far more of his own money than is usual in such a deal; private equity buyers typically use very little of their own cash to pay for an acquisition. Borrowing money is more standard, but Musk is borrowing a lot — $13 billion in loans would end up on Twitter’s books.
The deal may burden Twitter with more debt than it can handle, given its patchy profitability, The Times’s Anupreeta Das and DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch report in a close look at the numbers. And Musk’s push for more “free speech” on Twitter could hurt advertising income, making it harder for the company to pay off its new debt.
It is not too late for Musk to partner with other investors to reduce the amount of his own money in the deal, and this is something he is considering, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Thoma Bravo, a technology-focused buyout firm, is open to providing some financing. Apollo, an alternative asset manager, also looked at a possible deal where it would extend a loan on preferred terms.
The stakes are high for both Twitter and Tesla. Because Musk is selling Tesla shares as well as putting them up as collateral for personal loans to raise cash, Tesla’s value would be linked to Twitter’s. This is risky because any difficulties at Twitter could force Musk to sell Tesla stock and put the money into Twitter. If Tesla’s stock falls far enough, it would trigger clauses in Musk’s personal loans requiring him to add more collateral.

Will Musk’s unusual approach secure the social media network’s future, or will it end up squandering a big chunk of his fortune? That’s the question on many people’s minds, as details of the deal, which is expected to take three to six months to close, are hammered out.

2022-05-03,"LinkedIn, the professional networking platform, has reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor to pay $1.8 million to female employees who the agency said received far less compensation than their male colleagues from 2015 to 2017, the department said on Tuesday.
According to a statement released by the agency, LinkedIn denied 686 women equal pay at its San Francisco office and at its headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. The women worked in engineering, marketing and product roles.
During a routine evaluation, the agency found that the women in question had been paid “at a statistically significant lower rate” than their male counterparts even after taking into account “legitimate explanatory factors,” according to the conciliation agreement between LinkedIn and the Labor Department.
“Our agreement will ensure that LinkedIn better understands its obligations as a federal contractor,” Jane Suhr, a regional director of the Labor Department’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, said in the agency’s statement.
In a statement on Tuesday, LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, denied that it discriminated against certain employees.
“While we have agreed to settle this matter, we do not agree with the government’s claim,” the statement said.
The settlement includes around $1.75 million in back pay and more than $50,000 in interest to be paid to the women, according to the conciliation agreement.
As part of the settlement, LinkedIn also agreed to send the agency reports over the next three years as it evaluates its compensation policies and makes salary adjustments, the Labor Department said. The company agreed to run an employee training program on “nondiscrimination obligations.”
LinkedIn reported that, last year, its female employees made $0.999 for every dollar its male employees earned. The company said on its website that it employed more than 19,000 people worldwide.
“LinkedIn pays and has paid its employees fairly and equitably when comparing similar work,” the company’s statement said.
Under a 1965 executive order, federal contractors, including LinkedIn, must provide “equal opportunity” to its employees and cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, gender identity or other factors.
In general, women in the United States have been paid less than men. In 2021, women working full time earned about 83 percent of what their male counterparts did, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in January.
Tech companies have faced particular scrutiny over what critics say are failures to provide equal opportunities to women and people of color.
In February 2021, Google reached a $3.8 million settlement with the Labor Department amid accusations that it made hiring and compensation decisions that discriminated against female and Asian employees and applicants.
Under an agreement with state authorities in Rhode Island, Pinterest pledged $50 million in November 2021 to making reforms, in order to resolve allegations that it discriminated against women and people of color."

The gift establishes the Doerrs as leading funders of climate change research and scholarship, and will place Stanford at the center of public and private efforts to wean the world off fossil fuels.
“Climate and sustainability is going to be the new computer science,” Mr. Doerr, who made his estimated $11.3 billion fortune investing in technology companies such as Slack, Google and Amazon, said in an interview. “This is what the young people want to work on with their lives, for all the right reasons.”

The school, to be known as the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, will be a home to traditional academic departments related to topics such as planetary science, energy technology and food-and-water security. It will also feature several interdisciplinary institutes and a center focused on developing practical policy and technology solutions to the climate crisis.

“The school will absolutely focus on policy issues and on asking what would it take to move the world toward more sustainable practices and better behaviors,” Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the Stanford president, said in an interview.
Mr. Doerr joins a growing list of ultrawealthy men donating huge sums of money to the fight against global warming. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in 2020 said he was committing $10 billion of his own money to a new initiative he called the Bezos Earth Fund, and last year detailed how some of the money would be spent.
Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, said in 2019 he would spend $500 million to help close coal-fired power plants. And Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, has put billions of dollars to work on climate related issues through various efforts, including Breakthrough Energy and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Yet some question whether these philanthropic investments can make a difference when it comes to a planetary crisis.
“I don’t see how giving a billion dollars to a rich university is going to move the needle on this issue in a near-term time frame,” said David Callahan, author of “The Givers: Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age.” “It’s nice that he’s parting with his money, but that billion dollars could be better spent trying to move this up on the scale of public opinion. Until the public sees this as a top tier issue, politicians are not going to act.”
Arun Majumdar, who was named as the school’s inaugural dean and has advised the Obama and Biden administrations on energy issues, said the school would provide context and analysis around climate change issues, but would stop short of advocacy. “We will not go into the political arena,” he said. “That’s a very slippery slope for us.”
Mr. Majumdar, who currently holds a chair at Stanford named for Jay Precourt, a businessman who made his name in the oil business, also said that the new school would work with and accept donations from fossil fuel companies.
“Not all oil and gas industries are on board, but there are some who are who are under pressure to diversify, otherwise they will not survive,” Mr. Majumdar said. “Those that want to diversify and be part of the solutions, and they want to engage with us, we are open to that.”

Mr. Doerr said he was first inspired to address climate change in 2006, after he watched Al Gore’s film, “An Inconvenient Truth,” with his family. He said that, at dinner after the film, his daughter told him, “Your generation created this problem. You better fix it.” The next year, Mr. Gore joined Kleiner Perkins, Mr. Doerr’s venture capital firm.
In the years that followed, Kleiner Perkins made several major investments in clean energy companies and Mr. Doerr delivered a TED Talk titled “Salvation (and Profit) in Greentech.” But during the financial crisis of 2008, when the cost of natural gas plummeted due to fracking, many of those clean energy companies failed.
Last year Mr. Doerr published a book called “Speed & Scale: An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now.” In it, he calls for rapid action to reduce emissions and increase the use of renewable energy. Among his priorities are electrifying transportation, adding massive amounts of clean power to the grid and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production.
“We’ve got to be clear about the problem,” he said. “I believe this is a problem of scale that needs far greater ambition, urgency and excellence deployed against it.”
Mr. Doerr and his wife are signatories to the Giving Pledge, the effort founded by Mr. Gates, his ex-wife Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett to persuade ultrawealthy individuals to give away the majority of their fortunes during their lifetimes or in their wills. “Climate and sustainability is the most important of our causes,” Mr. Doerr said of his family’s philanthropic plans.

Other major universities, including Columbia, are establishing interdisciplinary schools focused on climate change as well. Yet the Doerr School for Sustainability, Stanford’s first new school in 70 years, will be among the largest and best funded. It will launch with 90 faculty members and add 60 more over the next 10 years. The university said it had raised an additional $590 million alongside the gift from the Doerrs, and that some of the funds would be used to construct two new buildings.
Mr. Doerr said he hoped that the gift would inspire other wealthy individuals to spend their fortunes combating climate change. “This is going to take more than one institution,” Mr. Doerr said. “Just like we have multiple medical schools, we need multiple sustainability schools to get the job done.”"
2022-05-05,"SEATTLE — Everything broke right for the Sounders, who were prodded for nearly two hours of grinding action by a sea of Seattle fans in blue and green who pushed their trademark electric energy to the pitch.
This was history — and it felt like a joint effort between a team and its supporters.
For over 20 years, no Major League Soccer team had ever won the CONCACAF Champions League tournament, which includes the best teams from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. But the Sounders ended the drought with a Pacific Northwest downpour: a 3-0 win over Pumas of Mexico on Wednesday.
How important was the win?

During this week’s run-up to the match, Sounders General Manager Garth Lagerwey called it a chance at soccer immortality.

In a promotional hype video, none other than the retired Seahawks icon Marshawn Lynch called it a “big (expletive) game.” At halftime on Wednesday, with the Sounders ahead 1-0, M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber stood in his suite at Lumen Field, looked me steadily in the eye, and called this match the “biggest game in the history of the league.”
Since its inception in 1996, M.L.S. has sought to become an American league of such quality that it could stand toe-to-toe with world powers. But until now, failure was a regular rite of passage for M.L.S. in this annual tournament, with teams from the rival Mexican league having won the last 13 Concacaf tournaments.
Well, the Sounders buried those failures on Wednesday.
Initially the match was choppy and bogged down by physical play that forced a pair of key Sounders, João Paulo and Nouhou Tolo, to leave with injuries. But Seattle flashed its trademark resilience. Goalie Stefan Frei, named the tournament’s most valuable player, backed up a stout defense, and Sounders kept up the attack until forward Raul Ruidiaz scored on a deflected shot late in the half. In the 80th minute, Ruidiaz added another goal off a smooth counterattack.
Nicolás Lodeiro sealed the victory with a goal in the 88th minute and ran toward the stands to celebrate among a frenzy of fans.
Winning qualifies the team for the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament stacked with soccer royalty. The Premier League’s Chelsea won it last. Either Liverpool or Real Madrid will represent Europe next. Just being in the same draw as teams of that pedigree is entirely new for M.L.S.

It’s fitting, then, that the Sounders will lead the league to this new precipice. Since entering M.L.S. during a wave of expansion in 2009, they have enchanted this soccer-rich city by winning two M.L.S. Cup championships in four runs to the finals. Seattle has led the league in attendance in all but two seasons, with area fans bringing the same fervor to Lumen as Seahawks fans have come to be known for. Maybe more. A tournament-record 68,741 fans showed up to watch the home team play Pumas. On a Wednesday night.

There is no single answer. Part of it is the city’s history of embracing the unconventional and outré — which still describes professional soccer in the American sports context. Seattle birthed Boeing and Microsoft, Starbucks and Amazon. It gave the world grunge rock and Quincy Jones. Jimi Hendrix went to high school three miles from Lumen Field. Bruce Lee sharpened his martial arts skills just a short walk away.
One of its great works of art is a troll sculpture that sits underneath a bridge. It’s become customary to drape it in a mammoth blue and green Sounders scarf before big games.
The love felt by this city for soccer in all its forms — from the Sounders to O.L. Reign of the N.W.S.L., to colleges and junior leagues — is also the product of a specific past and a specific team: the original Seattle Sounders of the long-defunct North American Soccer League.

From 1974 to 1983, those Sounders teams were part of the first bona fide effort to bring big-stakes, U.S.-based competition to professional soccer within this hemisphere.
If you ask me, a Seattle native who grew up in that era, I say the love began, specifically, with a single game.
Since I was 9 years old I’ve called it the Pelé Game. That’s when I took a city bus downtown to watch that original iteration of the Sounders. The date was April 9, 1976, the first sporting event ever held at the now-demolished Kingdome.
A crowd of nearly 60,000, then the largest in North American soccer history, watched Seattle host the star-studded New York Cosmos and its leader, the greatest player the game of soccer has ever seen: Pelé. The Black Pearl, as he was known, had come to the N.A.S.L. to celebrate a last stanza of his career — and as an ambassador to spark the game in North America. I don’t remember details of that match as much as I remember being in awe of the lithe and powerful Brazilian.

Pelé didn’t disappoint. He scored two goals in a 3-1 win.
The game was a harbinger. Those first Sounders players quickly became local legends, deeply woven into the city’s fabric. In those days, it seemed to me that a Sounder visited every classroom in every public school. In 1977, the Sounders made it to the league’s Soccer Bowl title match. Played in front of a full house in Portland, Ore., a three-hour drive south, they lost to the Cosmos, 2-1, in the last non-exhibition game Pelé ever played.

“I still have his jersey,” Jimmy McAlister said in a phone interview. I could almost see the smile in his voice. A defender on that Seattle team and the N.A.S.L. rookie of the year in 1977, McAlister told me how he’d somehow summoned the nerve to ask Pelé for his fabled No. 10 jersey. The legend obliged. The jersey now sits in McAlister’s lockbox.
“People call me from time to time, wanting to buy it,” he said. It’s not for sale. Some things are worth more than money. The jersey contains memory and soul.
McAlister loves the modern day Sounders. He hailed their cohesiveness, blue collar work ethic, and their growing talent. Raised in Seattle, he is one of many Sounders who remained in the city after their playing days were over. These days he runs one of the top junior development clubs. Many others stayed to teach the game, coaching in clinics and at high schools and colleges. Some helped guide a now-defunct minor league team — also called the Sounders.
They kept soccer alive in the fallow pair of decades between the N.A.S.L.’s demise and the birth of M.L.S.

On Wednesday night, nearly an hour after the game, fans remained in Lumen Field. Vast swaths of them. Joyful chants rumbled down to the confetti-covered field. Players responded by lifting the gold Champions League trophy high. Unlike that Kingdome game of 1976 — the original Sounders versus the glitzy, star-studded Cosmos — this matchup wasn’t memorable because of the opponent. It was memorable because of the home team, which just put itself on the international map. And that would surely make Pelé, long soccer’s proudest ambassador, more than a little proud."
2022-05-06,"These are rocky times for most investments. But it has been a wonderful stretch for the dollar.
You may not have noticed if you haven’t traveled abroad and exchanged dollars for euros, yen or nearly any other major currency. But many currency traders, S&P 500 company executives and economists certainly have.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against six other important currencies, is hovering at levels it hadn’t reached in 20 years. Since the start of the year, it has gained 8 percent; in the last 12 months, it has risen 14 percent. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar has risen more than 13 percent this year alone.
The Federal Reserve’s latest moves to tighten monetary conditions are likely to spur the dollar further. Fed policymakers decided on Wednesday to raise short-term interest rates half a percentage point and to begin reducing the bonds on its $9 trillion balance sheet in June.
Continuing interest rate increases are likely in the Fed’s efforts to bring down inflation. While rising rates can be expected to make stocks, bonds and mortgage rates more volatile, there’s an excellent chance they will burnish the dollar.

Fundamentally, a flood of foreign money into U.S. businesses and investments has been driving up the value of the dollar.
In fact, a variety of actions that have unsettled the stock and bond markets have worked together to boost the greenback’s value against other currencies. These include the Fed rate increases, Russia’s war in Ukraine, global sanctions on Russia, soaring commodity prices, China’s lockdowns, and Europe’s and Japan’s economic slowdowns.
Against this backdrop of faltering world economies and geopolitical instability, global demand has risen for relatively safe and increasingly higher-yielding assets like Treasurys. The U.S. economy may be in a precarious spot, but compared with other countries, it has recovered well from the pandemic recession, its markets continue to be deep and relatively stable, and the interest rates offered on its government bonds are generous.
The Fed’s commitment to fight inflation by raising interest rates can be expected to push up Treasury yields further. That could make them even more attractive in comparison with the lower-yielding bonds of nations like Germany, Japan and China, which have been easing local monetary conditions, not tightening them. Already, yield discrepancies, or spreads, are wide. These are the yields for 10-year government bonds.
United States, about 3.1 percent.
Germany, about 1.1 percent.
Japan, less than 0.25 percent.
Even yields on Chinese bonds, which had been higher than those in the United States, dropped below Treasurys recently.

The economic impact

A more valuable dollar makes U.S. imports cheaper and exports less competitive on world markets.

The rising dollar has had significant effects on the global economy. For one thing, it has contributed to the surging U.S. trade deficit, which hit a new high in March. A more valuable currency makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive and less competitive on world markets.
For another, it reduces inflationary pressures in the United States.
“America is a nation of consumers, and over half of what Americans consume every year is made abroad,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist of his own firm, Rosenberg Research in Toronto, in an interview. “As the dollar goes up, the cost of these imported goods goes down. Those declining costs will be showing up in the Consumer Price Index. We haven’t seen the full brunt of it yet.”
Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said the rising dollar had mitigated some of the inflationary effects in the United States of rising commodities like oil, which are priced in dollars.

“It’s unusual for the dollar to strengthen at the same time as commodity prices are rising” largely because of Russia’s war in Ukraine, she said.
But if the Fed was to decide that the economy was too weak to withstand rising interest rates and “take the foot off the brakes and not tighten monetary policy as fast as everybody thinks,” she said, “then the dollar would weaken and we would still have high inflation in commodities, and we could get stuck in a real stagflation thing.” That, she added, “is why this is a particularly dangerous time for the economy.”
Mr. Rosenberg said that by raising interest rates sharply when the dollar was already helping to pull down inflation, the Fed might be driving the economy into a recession. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference on Wednesday that inflation was too high for the Fed to hold back.
“I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession,” Mr. Powell said.
Headwinds for companies

The rising dollar is making life difficult for many global corporations. On top of supply chain disruptions and inflation, they need to worry about the effect of the rising dollar on their profits. It’s earnings season on Wall Street, and this theme has come up repeatedly.

The dollar is hurting Apple’s revenue this quarter, Luca Maestri, the company’s chief financial officer, told analysts. “With respect to foreign exchange,” he said, “we expect it to be a nearly 300-basis-point headwind to our year-over-year growth rate.” That means a negative 3 percent effect.
In much the same vein, Andre Schulten, chief financial officer for Procter & Gamble, said: “We’ve seen another step in cost pressures, and foreign exchange rates have moved further against us.” Losses from the dollar are likely “to be a $300 million after-tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year,” he said.

These foreign exchange losses carry over to the stock market.
A 2018 study by S&P Dow Jones Indices found that S&P 500 companies with the least dependence on foreign revenue tended to perform well when the dollar was strengthening. That appears to be happening now.

A subindex of the S&P 500 — the S&P 500 U.S. Revenue Exposure Index, filled with domestic-oriented companies like Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth Group, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase — dropped 6.2 percent this year through Thursday. That’s a stupendous return when you compare the index with its more international counterpart, the S&P 500 Foreign Revenue Exposure Index, which lost 15.7 percent. The biggest constituents of the foreign index are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Tesla.
While making substantial, direct bets on the dollar is hazardous, it is possible to do so through exchange-traded funds. The Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bullish Fund, for example, has gained 8.1 percent this year. That compares with losses of 13 percent for the S&P 500 and 11.1 percent for the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, a popular benchmark for bonds.
But before drawing practical conclusions from this comparison, remember that the dollar won’t keep rising forever. In fact, it may make more sense to bet on the opposite direction, Ms. Shalett suggested.
Putting money into companies with international exposure, and investing in markets that have been pummeled, like Japan, may be a good contrarian move if you have a lot of patience and fortitude, she said. Similarly, stocks and bonds in many emerging markets, which have been hit hard by the pandemic and by the war in Ukraine, are becoming attractively priced.
Chinese stocks and bonds may be good opportunities, too. “I suspect that when China emerges from these Covid lockdowns, and its economy really begins to revive, it will pull other emerging market economies with it,” Ms. Shalett said. “That might be when the dollar weakens.”

Or it might not. U.S. Treasury secretaries usually say they favor a strong dollar, even when economic conditions don’t warrant it, as I observed in 2015, during another bout of dollar ascendancy.
Like this one, it occurred largely because monetary policies in the United States were out of sync with those in other major countries. As a side effect, American travelers got a little more for their money, but American exporters suffered.
The dollar’s victory lap didn’t last long. This one probably won’t, either."

2022-05-10,"The iPod began with a modest goal: Let’s create a music product that makes people want to buy more Macintosh computers. Within a few years, it would change consumer electronics and the music industry and lead to Apple becoming the most valuable company in the world.
First arriving in October 2001, the pocket-size rectangle with a white face and polished steel frame weighed 6.5 ounces. It came packaged with white earbuds in a custom color, moon gray, and held 1,000 songs.
It exploded in popularity in the years that followed, creating what became known as the iPod generation. Throughout much of the 2000s, people wandered the world, headphones dangling from their ears. The iPod was ubiquitous.
On Tuesday, Apple officially said goodbye to all that. The company announced it had phased out production of its iPod Touch, bringing an end to a two-decade run of a product line that inspired the creation of the iPhone and helped turn Silicon Valley into the epicenter of global capitalism.
Since introducing the iPod in 2001, Apple has sold an estimated 450 million of them, according to Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm specializing in tech research. Last year it sold an estimated three million iPods, a fraction of the estimated 250 million iPhones it sold.

2022-05-11,"SAN FRANCISCO — There was a time when Google offered a wondrous vision of the future, with driverless cars, augmented-reality eyewear, unlimited storage of emails and photos, and predictive texts to complete sentences in progress.
A more modest Google was on display on Wednesday as the company kicked off its annual developer’s conference. The Google of 2022 is more pragmatic and sensible — a bit more like its business-focused competitors at Microsoft than a fantasy play land for tech enthusiasts.
And that, by all appearances, is by design. The bold vision is still out there — but it’s a ways away. The professional executives who now run Google are increasingly focused on wringing money out of those years of spending on research and development.
The company’s biggest bet in artificial intelligence does not, at least for now, mean science fiction come to life. It means more subtle changes to existing products.

“A.I. is improving our products, making them more helpful, more accessible, and delivering innovative new features for everyone,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said on Wednesday.
In a presentation short of wow moments, Google stressed that its products were “helpful.” In fact, Google executives used the words “help,” “helping,” or “helpful” more than 50 times during two hours of keynote speeches, including a marketing campaign for its new hardware products with the line: “When it comes to helping, we can’t help but help.”
It introduced a cheaper version of its Pixel smartphone, a smartwatch with a round screen and a new tablet coming next year. (“The most helpful tablet in the world.”)
The biggest applause came from a new Google Docs feature in which the company’s artificial-intelligence algorithms automatically summarize a long document into a single paragraph.
At the same time, it was not immediately clear how some of the other groundbreaking work, like language models that better understand natural conversation or that can break down a task into logical smaller steps, will ultimately lead to the next generation of computing that Google has touted.

Certainly some of the new ideas do appear helpful. In one demonstration about how Google continues to improve its search technology, the company showed a feature called “multisearch,” in which a user can snap a photo of a shelf full of chocolates and then find the best-reviewed dark chocolate bar without nuts from the picture.
In another example, Google showed how you can find a picture of a specific dish, like Korean stir-fried noodles, and then search for nearby restaurants serving that dish.
Much of those capabilities are powered by the deep technological work Google has done for years using so-called machine learning, image recognition and natural language understanding. It’s a sign of an evolution rather than revolution for Google and other large tech giants.
Many companies can build digital services easier and faster than in the past because of shared technologies such as cloud computing and storage, but building the underlying infrastructure — such as artificial intelligence language models — is so costly and time-consuming that only the richest companies can invest in them.
As is often the case at Google events, the company didn’t spend a lot of time explaining how it makes money. Google brought up the topic of advertising — which still accounts for 80 percent of the company’s revenue — after an hour of other announcements, highlighting a new feature called My Ad Center. It will allow users to request fewer ads from certain brands or to highlight topics they would like to see more ads about."

Inflation? Rising interest rates? The lingering pandemic? The Russia-Ukraine conflict?
All of the above explain the tech stock dive. After the very good times in 2021, the reckoning for tech valuations, as well as start-up funding by venture capitalists and cryptocurrency, is officially here, with all plunging into the Mariana Trench of finance. The only question is whether it is 2001 (the Web 1.0 crash) or 2008 (the Web 2.0 crash) or some new web3 crash.
The canary in the coal mine is how those typically sunny venture capitalists’ Twitter accounts have flipped to earnest talk of “market corrections” and “company right-sizing.”
Most of the big company stocks have been in the tank, with even solid businesses suffering over the past month — Apple is down about 15 percent; Alphabet over 12 percent; Airbnb close to 28 percent. Weaker ones have seen a more precipitous decline; Netflix stock has lost half its value since mid-April.
Oddly, the one staying relatively stable now is Twitter, which spent years being lapped by other Silicon Valley firms. No doubt it’s being propped up by the $44 billion takeover bid by Elon Musk — and yet even that acquisition is in now doubt since the collateral for the purchase rests with his fortune at Tesla. Like its peers, Tesla’s bottoming out, its stock having dropped nearly 30 percent in the past month.
That might make the $1 billion walkaway fee much more attractive to Musk, who could come back when Twitter inevitably craters post-breakup. In the starkest of terms, he should not pay $54.20 a share for the troubled company (it was trading around $45 a share on Thursday), no matter how much he likes to troll.
Oh, but that is not all in the techopalypse.
As The New York Times noted: “The number of people and groups trying to unload their start-up shares doubled in the first three months of the year from late last year,” citing Phil Haslett of EquityZen, which helps private companies and their employees sell their stock. Share prices of some unicorn start-ups have fallen as much as 44 percent in recent months, The Times wrote. “It’s the first sustained pullback in the market that people have seen in legitimately 10 years,” said Haslett."
2022-05-13,"In a tech industry dominated by Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, it can be easy to forget that much of the humdrum work that makes screens flicker, servers hum and businesses run is performed by companies that rarely make the headlines, companies that have been gradually shaping the computer business for decades, companies like IBM.
Over the past 30 years, IBM has changed drastically, becoming a major player in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. And during those decades, Arvind Krishna was rising through the ranks of Big Blue, becoming chief executive in January 2020.
Mr. Krishna, who grew up in India before coming to the United States to get his Ph.D., has spent most of his career at IBM, and recently led the company’s acquisition of Red Hat.
Yet running a company as large as IBM requires more than just good business chops these days. The pandemic hit just as Mr. Krishna took over, forcing him to grapple with remote work, a splintered corporate culture and market turbulence. And IBM — which has been engaging with diversity, equity and inclusion issues for decades — is being forced to contend with a social and political landscape that demands companies take a stand on hot-button topics.

Russia scales back its charge east
After a series of military setbacks, Moscow now appears to be focusing on a narrow objective: widening its holdings in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donbas. But even there Russia may be forced to scale back its ambition to take most of eastern Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War.
Russia still controls the wide swath of southern Ukraine it seized early in the war, including Kherson, and continues to impose a naval blockade that is strangling the Ukrainian economy. But Russia has not secured a major strategic gain in the east.
On Sunday, the Ukrainian military released a video purporting to show a small group of soldiers reaching the Russian border near Kharkiv — a powerful symbolic moment. Russian forces had to retreat from the city, Ukraine’s second-largest, earlier this month.
NATO: The alliance is preparing to fast-track admission for Finland and Sweden, which formally announced that they will seek membership. On Monday, NATO forces from 14 countries held a large, long-planned military exercise on Russia’s doorstep in Estonia, a tough Kremlin critic.
Vladimir Putin: The Russian president is increasingly isolated. He met with his five closest allies on Monday; only Belarus spoke up in support of Putin’s war.
Soldiers: Russia has likely run out of combat-ready reservists, forcing it to draw from private companies and militias, the institute reported. But to many Russians, defeat remains inconceivable.

The S&P 500 ESG Index, a listing of companies that meet certain environmental, social and governance standards, removed Tesla last month. But the decision to eject the world’s largest maker of electric vehicles from a club that includes oil producers like Exxon Mobil attracted little notice until S&P Global, which manages the index, offered an explanation this week.
S&P cited claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif.. Those claims have prompted a California state agency to file a lawsuit, which Tesla is contesting. S&P said its decision was also influenced by Tesla’s handling of an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to the company’s driver-assistance system, known as Autopilot.
“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider E.S.G. lens,” Margaret Dorn, head of E.S.G. indices in North America at S&P, said in the firm’s explanation.

Tesla stock was the fourth most heavily weighted in the index before it was removed, behind Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. Funds that track the index were obligated to own Tesla shares when it joined the index in May 2021 and to sell them when it was booted off.
Exxon Mobil is the ninth most heavily weighted stock in the index, prompting a blast from Mr. Musk. “Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list!” he wrote on Twitter. “ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.”
S&P did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Exxon made the list and Tesla didn’t.
Tesla has previously faced criticism from investors who say it has released little information about the impact of its manufacturing or labor practices.
“Elon has branded himself and the entire company on the importance of environmental sustainability,” said Kristin Hull, the founder and chief executive of Nia Impact Capital, a fund in Oakland, Calif., that invests in companies with a positive social impact. Yet, Dr. Hull added, Tesla has been stingy with information about its water use or how it sources materials used in batteries.

“You can’t have a racial equity lawsuit and be considered a top E.S.G. name,” she added.
Passive index funds, which collectively direct about a third of all the assets invested in the stock market, are required to match their portfolios to the index they track.  Getting included in or removed from an index can impact a company’s stock price. General Electric’s shares, for instance, fell 3 percent shortly after it was announced in mid-2018 that the company, an original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was being removed from that index.

But the drop in Tesla’s share price of more than 30 percent since the end of March was more likely the result of concern about Mr. Musk’s offer to buy Twitter and a broader shift in how investors view technology stocks.
S&P reported that there were $65 billion in assets invested in funds tied to its E.S.G. index at the end of December 2020, the most recently available figure. That’s far smaller than the $13 trillion that is in funds tied to the more widely followed S&P 500 index, of which Tesla remains a member. That $65 billion is also small compared to Tesla’s overall market value of nearly $750 billion. And only a portion of the holdings of those E.S.G. funds are in Tesla.
What’s more, of the $65 billion tied to the E.S.G. index, only $11 billion of that money is invested in passive index funds, which would be required to sell their Tesla stakes. The rest of the money is in funds that benchmark their performance against the S&P 500 E.S.G. index. Many of those funds are actively managed by portfolio managers. Those funds aren’t required to sell their Tesla holdings, but they might do so in order to not deviate too far from the index that they are compared to by investors.
“Tesla is just simply not an open-and-shut E.S.G. case,” said Jon Hale, who directs sustainability research at mutual fund tracking firm Morningstar. “While it’s clear the company’s product is beneficial to the environment, Tesla is now a big company and it also has an impact on employees and customers, and those issues concern E.S.G. investors.”

Several other prominent companies were also dropped from the index in April when S&P determined they no longer met the criteria for membership. They included Chevron, Delta Air Lines, Home Depot and News Corp.
Even if ejections do not impact the value of a company’s shares, they could have an impact on a company’s actions. “Elon Musk and Tesla may be the exception,” Mr. Hale said. “But the flip side of that is very few companies want to be E.S.G. laggards in the current environment.”"

2022-05-20,"Mosopefoluwa Ogundipe and Iyanuoluwa Imoru are from the same Nigerian state, Ondo, the same local government area, Akoko North-East, and the same Yoruba tribe. But it wasn’t until they were halfway around the world that their paths finally crossed.
Mr. Ogundipe, 28, who goes by Sope, and Ms. Imoru, 29, known as Iyanu, met in September 2019, at the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference in San Diego. Ms. Imoru was in a line of people waiting to speak to representatives from Microsoft when she heard Mr. Ogundipe’s familiar accent.
They made some small talk, but Ms. Imoru remained laser focused. “I was trying to get a job, not meet a guy,” she said.
Two days later, at the same conference, they attended a gathering on the beach, where they spent much more time chatting. Afterward, they shared an Uber back to their respective hotels. When the driver accidentally passed Mr. Ogundipe’s hotel, he took it as a sign that he was supposed to get her phone number.

After the computing conference, they kept in touch sporadically, and over time, more regularly, until they were speaking daily.
The two had relocated to the United States a year earlier, in 2018, to further their education. A graduate of the University of Lagos, Mr. Ogundipe had enrolled at the University of San Francisco to earn a master’s degree in computer science. Ms. Imoru, who graduated from Obafemi Awolowo University and holds a law degree from the Nigerian Law School, came to pursue a master’s degree in computer information systems at Prairie View A&M University in Texas.
Soon after Mr. Ogundipe completed his master’s program in May 2020, he took a job in Austin, Texas. The two then began to see each other every weekend, in either Austin or Prairie View.
Mr. Ogundipe, who had never had a girlfriend, knew that he wanted Ms. Imoru to be his first one because they shared the same values and envisioned a similar future. “It was just this deep-seated knowledge that I knew that this is the person,” he said.

Though open to becoming a couple, Ms. Imoru was at first hesitant about marriage. “Let’s see if we can get through a week of dating in person,” she recalled thinking.
By August 2020, she had come around to the idea. “I noticed how great we were together in person,” said Ms. Imoru, who completed her master’s program that December.
“I love how smart he is,” she added. “One of our first conversations was about a computer issue and it went on for several hours, but in that, he showed how he’s smart, funny, and always makes me laugh.”
In February 2021, Ms. Imoru began her current job as an infrastructure engineering associate at AllianceBernstein, an asset management firm in Nashville, where she moved that July and now lives.
The month before, Mr. Ogundipe proposed to her on a boat while they were on a trip to Florida in June 2021.

Currently living in Austin, Mr. Ogundipe works remotely as a software engineer at LinkedIn, the online networking platform, in Sunnyvale, Calif.
The couple married April 30 at the Woodlands Methodist Church in the Woodlands, Texas. Dr. John Hull, the pastor of missions at the church, officiated at the ceremony before around 250 guests. A reception followed at a hall on the church’s grounds.
The night before they were married, they held a traditional Nigerian wedding ceremony at the Crowne Plaza Shenandoah, also in the Woodlands, with about 120 family members and friends. During that ceremony, Mr. Ogundipe’s family presented Ms. Imoru’s family with food items like yams, oil and rice, and Mr. Ogundipe and his groomsmen prostrated themselves in front of her family. The bride, who is taking the groom’s surname, plans to relocate to Austin to live with him.
About a year before the couple met, Mr. Ogundipe’s mother had sent him a WhatsApp message telling him that she had been praying that he would bring home a Nigerian woman. “All you can do is pray,” Mr. Ogundipe recalled replying. “I’m open to anyone.”
Of the woman he ultimately found, Mr. Ogundipe said, “I preferred this,” adding that back then, “I just didn’t know it.”"

Growing up in the 1980s, I knew there were kids like those on “Stranger Things,” which returns Friday for its fourth season, who spent their after-school hours playing Dungeons & Dragons. I was not one of them; I played with Barbies. I figured what I was doing with dolls — acting out scenes involving homework, school dances and what happened last weekend at the plastic pool — was a far cry from the secretive world of the D&D table, with its arcane mythos and complicated rules.
It wasn’t until 2000, when an episode of the show “Freaks and Geeks” featured kids playing D&D, that I got a glimpse into how role-playing games worked. In essence, it was not so different from what my friends and I were doing with Barbies: imagining and then inhabiting characters, writing stories collaboratively, escaping reality while developing real-life social skills.
While I retired my Barbies by the time puberty hit, the universe of Dungeons & Dragons is intricate and expansive enough that it has continuing appeal for adults. In fact, it has so fully emerged from nerd-dom that it has become “something of a social flex — the antithesis of the popularity contest that was the 1990s and early 2000s, an antidote to our more basic tendencies,” Amelia Diamond writes in The Times this morning. Vin Diesel plays. So does Tiffany Haddish.
I’ve written about how socializing is weird lately. D&D offers one way to alleviate some of the anxiety. Rules govern interactions, and a dungeon master who acts as both narrator and referee enforces them. In the safety of this container, players explore, improvise, cocreate worlds.

“All of us at times feel a little inadequate in dealing with the modern world,” Gary Gygax, one of the creators of D&D, once said. “It would feel much better if we knew that we were a superhero or a mighty wizard.”
D&D and other role-playing games, improv comedy, murder-mystery parties where each guest is assigned a part in a whodunit, even escape rooms: They’re all creative, rule-bound forms of fun where scenes are created in real time and success requires teamwork and trust.
They’re lo-fi ways to socialize through performance, a relief from social media venues that insist we perform as ourselves for an audience of friends and followers. These activities give us permission to play, to drop our inhibitions and try on new personas. They let us escape into another world for a little while.

Jordan Marsh’s Blueberry Muffins
I’ve always been a strong advocate for eating dessert for breakfast, which is part of why Jordan Marsh’s blueberry muffins have been on my radar for a while. I finally whipped up a batch this past week, using thawed frozen berries as suggested in the recipe notes. And I’m here to report that these purple-speckled beauties are truly deserving of their 11,000-ish five-star ratings. Yes, they are distinctly cupcake-like: fluffy and sugary, and completely delightful with your morning cup of coffee or tea. But if the idea of cake before noon puts you off, serve them as a midafternoon snack or even dessert — the after-dinner kind of dessert, that is.

2022-05-23,"Snap, the maker of the messaging app Snapchat, said on Monday that it expected to miss its quarterly financial goals as it dealt with toughening economic conditions.
Evan Spiegel, Snap’s chief executive, said in an email to employees that the company was likely to miss its targets for revenue and adjusted profit in the second quarter. Snap would also slow its pace of hiring this year, though the company still expected to add around 500 employees, he said in the email, which was obtained by The New York Times.
“Like many companies, we continue to face rising inflation and interest rates, supply chain shortages and labor disruptions, platform policy changes, the impact of the war in Ukraine, and more,” Mr. Spiegel wrote.
The warning sent Snap’s stock price plummeting nearly 30 percent in after-hours trading, after closing at $22.47. Snap declined to comment further.

Snap’s announcement comes amid a slowdown for tech start-ups, as venture capital funding has fallen and young companies have been cutting costs and laying off employees. Some social media companies have also been hit by other factors, including changes to Apple’s privacy settings that have hurt their ability to do targeted advertising. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, recently instituted a temporary hiring freeze for some roles.
Still, tech giants including Microsoft, Apple and Google are continuing to spend big.
In April, Snap reported more than $1 billion in revenue for the first quarter, which fell narrowly short of Wall Street’s expectations. The company projected that revenue for the second quarter would increase by 20 to 25 percent from $982 million a year earlier.
“Since we issued guidance on April 21, 2022, the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated,” Derek Andersen, Snap’s chief financial officer, wrote in a brief statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said digital advertising, which makes up much of Snap’s revenue, was often among the first cuts in periods of economic uncertainty.
“Given the growing list of challenges to the economy including inflation in food and fuel prices, we are not surprised that Snap’s 2Q22 sales are expected to fall short of its prior guidance,” Mr. Forte said."

Tommy James & the Shondells sang “Crystal Blue Persuasion.” Economists have their own shade of persuasion — Bayesian.
Bayesian persuasion is an idea only a little more than a decade old that’s being used to study phenomena as varied as advertising, the law, bond ratings and parking enforcement. A working paper this month uses it to analyze political lies. The authors conclude that politicians will lie more when they know they’re being fact-checked. (Finding a real-life example of that behavior is left as an exercise for the reader.)
Thomas Bayes was an 18th-century English statistician, philosopher and Presbyterian minister. He developed a statistical model for how to update your predictions in light of old and new knowledge. Let’s say you test positive for a rare, fatal disease. If the false positive rate is only 1 percent, you might start putting your affairs in order. But a Bayesian would incorporate, among other things, the prior knowledge of the rarity of the disease — say, one in a million people get it — and conclude that the test result is probably wrong.
Bayesian persuasion is a technique that uses information rather than bribes or threats to get people to see the world differently and change their behavior in desired ways. It assumes all people have prior beliefs about the world that they update as new information, such as a diagnostic test result, comes in. There is a “sender” and a “receiver.” The goal for the sender is to share the information that will most effectively persuade the receiver to act in a certain way.
This week I spoke with Emir Kamenica, one of the two authors of “Bayesian Persuasion,” the 2009 paper that gave birth to the new field. When I got Kamenica on the phone, he had just finished teaching a class on the topic at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. He gave me a hypothetical situation to illustrate the basic idea.
Imagine a wrongful death case where the judge wants to get the verdict right but the plaintiff just wants to win the case. It’s a civil case so the standard of proof is simply the preponderance of evidence.

2022-05-26,"Broadcom, the semiconductor giant, said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy the software company VMware in a transaction valued at $61 billion that would reshuffle the vast market for enterprise computing technology.
The deal, which would furnish Broadcom with popular computing tools used by a large swath of corporations, would be the world’s second-biggest proposed acquisition this year, after Microsoft’s $75 billion bid for the video game company Activision Blizzard, according to data from Dealogic.
While the combination would make Broadcom a significant player in data-center technology and cloud computing, it is hardly a joining of household names, as is Elon Musk’s high-profile pursuit of Twitter. It is a reminder, however, that tens of billions of dollars are spent every year in mergers among the many companies that make the technologies that power the internet and large corporate computer networks.
The deal with Broadcom is the latest in a series of ownership changes for VMware, a pioneering software company that helped create some of the key technologies now commonly used in cloud computing. VMware has more than 500,000 customers around the world, and counts as partners all the major cloud providers, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That makes VMware a prized asset for Broadcom’s chief executive, Hock E. Tan. Broadcom will spend the equivalent of $138.23 per share for VMware in the cash-and-stock deal, it said in a statement. That is more than 40 percent higher than VMware’s stock price before rumors of a deal began to circulate last weekend.
VMware “is providing the plumbing for most of the world,” Dennis Smith, an analyst at Gartner, said in an interview. VMware’s software helps manage more corporate information than the combined public clouds of Amazon, Microsoft and Google — all of which have battled to bring more of that data to their services, Mr. Smith said.
Mr. Tan had been one of the most acquisitive forces in the chip industry, stitching Broadcom together one deal at a time, until President Donald J. Trump blocked Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion takeover of the chip maker Qualcomm in March 2018 on national security grounds. Broadcom, which was based in Singapore at the time, has moved its headquarters to San Jose, Calif.
Since then, Mr. Tan has diversified his targets. He bought the software company CA Technologies for $18.9 billion later in 2018 and a security division of Symantec for $10.7 billion in 2019.
In those deals, Mr. Tan pursued established companies that are essential to corporate computer infrastructure. CA had started decades earlier by supplying software for mainframe computers and had moved over the years into an array of products, while Symantec made a name as a leader in cybersecurity tools.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Under the agreement, CA and Symantec will become a part of VMware, which will be the new name of Broadcom’s software division. Whether Broadcom will give VMware autonomy in decision making is “the $61 billion question,” Mr. Smith said.
Broadcom said it would finance the deal with $32 billion in debt from numerous banks. The company said it planned to “rapidly” reduce its debt after the transaction. The chip maker followed a similar pattern in its recent software transactions, bingeing then digesting by prioritizing debt repayments.

With its so-called virtualization software, which allows one computer to act like many machines and essentially makes computing more efficient, VMware would be Broadcom’s flagship asset. VMware boosted the role of software in data centers and revamped how organizations manage their industrial computers. The concepts behind VMware’s technology were foundational to cloud computing, which is dependent on virtualization.
VMware reported revenue of $12.9 billion in its last fiscal year, which ended Jan. 28. That was a 9 percent increase from the previous year. That growth rate was much slower than the cloud-computing arms of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Founded in 1998, before the cloud boom, VMware has depended on clients that still operate their own data centers.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The deal is the latest in a series of major changes for VMware. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., lost its longtime chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, to Intel in January 2021. On May 12, it gained a new chief executive, Raghu Raghuram, and lost a chief operating officer, Sanjay Poonen, on the same day. In November, the software maker became independent when it was spun off from Dell Technologies.
Under Mr. Gelsinger, VMware was eager to extricate itself from the personal computer maker that owned a majority of its shares. Dell gained the stake through its acquisition of EMC, which was VMware’s previous majority owner. VMware envisioned independence as a strategic benefit, allowing it to forge new alliances with a variety of technology providers. It also believed that Wall Street would reward it with a higher share price if it separated from Dell.
Instead, the company’s shares declined 19 percent from the start of the year to Friday, the last trading day before Bloomberg reported on the negotiations with Broadcom.
Brad Zelnick, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said VMware had lost luster with public investors because it had struggled to compete with newer cloud technology.
“They’ve been challenged as a business in adapting to this transition,” Mr. Zelnick said.
That stock slump made VMware a more attractive target for Mr. Tan, and potentially other suitors. If shareholders and regulators approve the deal, VMware’s long-desired independence will come to an end.
The terms of the deal with Broadcom include a “go-shop” period, which gives VMware’s management 40 days to seek a better offer from a different buyer. Acquiring VMware could make sense for several other technology companies, including IBM and Intel."
2022-05-27,"At the bottom of the ocean there is a garden hose stuffed with glass. Life is difficult at this depth. Plants are unknown; oxygen is scarce. There are eels with very large mouths and fish that glow.
Their world may seem strange, but it has a point of contact with our own. That hose filled with glass is ours; we put it there. It is a bundle of optical fibers that carry beams of light. The beams of light are bits of data, encoded as pulses. The bits of data are Facebook friend requests and financial trades, Twitch streams and supply chain analytics. Here, among the eels, lies a major artery of the algorithmic age.
There are many such arteries, but this one is known as MAREA. It is the highest-capacity submarine fiber-optic cable in the Atlantic, running across the ocean from a suburb of Bilbao, Spain, to Virginia Beach. Where it comes ashore, it looks like a snake rising out of the sea.
MAREA is a reminder that the internet has a body. A body of glass, copper, silicon and a thousand other things — things that have to be dug out of the earth and hammered into useful shapes, with significant inputs of labor and energy.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Bodies are material; they are also historical. Submarine cables like MAREA, writes the scholar Nicole Starosielski, frequently follow “the contours of earlier networks.” Installing underwater lines is expensive, and it’s safer to follow the paths of prior telephone and telegraph networks — themselves shaped by even older patterns of empire and capital. Cables typically shadow the sea routes pioneered in previous centuries, routes that circulated cotton, silver, spices, settlers and slaves.
The growth of networks was guided by a desire for power and profit. They were not just conduits for conveying information, but mechanisms for forging relationships of control. While the internet is more sophisticated than its predecessors, it continues this tradition.
As a result, some are saying that the connectivity it enables is not only making the world smaller but making it worse. They worry about fake news, surveillance, the invasion of our privacy, the exploitation of app-based workers, and the proliferation of right-wing propaganda on social media, to name just a few.
Since 2016, a mood of distrust has congealed around the big tech companies that rule the internet, a mood often called the “techlash.” Polling suggests that public opinion has taken a turn: In 2019, only half of Americans said that tech companies had a positive effect, compared with 71 percent in 2015, according to the Pew Research Center. A Gallup poll from 2021 put the number even lower, with only 34 percent of Americans taking a positive view. The belief that the internet is broken has become a new common sense.
But if the internet is broken, how do we fix it?
The answers that predominate among American policymakers tend to circle two main themes — which are, in practice, often joined together. The first involves writing new rules about how companies are allowed to behave, or enforcing existing ones. Examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act, a 2018 law that gives residents certain rights regarding the collection and processing of their personal data.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The second aims at reducing the market power of the big firms. Last year, President Biden issued an executive order that directs more than a dozen federal agencies to pursue pro-competition initiatives. And this year, two Senate bills seeking to prevent tech companies from using their control of platforms like search engines and app stores to give themselves an unfair advantage over competitors were approved in committee, bringing them closer to a floor vote.
Both strains of internet reform have their merits. The rule-makers are right that tech companies are too lightly regulated. The anti-monopolists are right that rule-making is insufficient without curbing corporate power. Yet neither quite reaches the root of the problem.
The root is simple: The internet is broken because the internet is a business. While the issues are various and complex, they are inextricable from the fact that the internet is owned by private firms and is run for profit. Regulating markets or making them more competitive won’t touch the deeper problem, which is the market itself. MAREA and other cables are, to borrow a metaphor from the Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, like veins in a mine. Through them, wealth is extracted and communities are dominated.
The problems that have provoked the techlash are diverse, but none of them would exist if they didn’t contribute to profits. The profit system produces the dysfunctions and depredations of the modern internet.
Today’s internet reformers would leave this system intact. Yet many of the industry practices with the most destructive effects, such as the obsession with user engagement, were developed by companies when they were comparatively leaner and hungrier and needed to grab market share as quickly as possible. In other words, they came out of competition, which suggests that increasing competition won’t automatically generate better outcomes.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Regulation, too, presents difficulties: Corporations are adept at evading or manipulating rules to preserve their dominant position. Indeed, some big tech firms have even called for more regulation in recent years, provided they get to decide how they’re regulated.
Even with the best regulatory and antimonopoly measures, corporations would still own the internet. Immensely consequential decisions would be left in the hands of executives and investors. Most people would have no say in matters that centrally affect their lives.
Fortunately, there is another strategy: deprivatization.
To build a better internet, we need to change how it is owned and organized — not with an eye toward making markets work better, but toward making them matter less. Deprivatization aims at creating an internet where people, and not profit, rule. This sounds like a protest chant but I mean it quite literally.
What would a day on the deprivatized internet look like? You wake up, grab coffee, and sit down at your computer. Your first stop is a social-media site run by your local library. The other users are your neighbors, your co-workers, or residents of your county. There’s a news report in your feed about a coming municipal election, published by a local public media center. In fact, much of the content that circulates on the site comes from public media sources.
The site is a cooperative; you and the other users govern it collectively. You elect the board that designs the filtering algorithms and writes the content moderation policies that determine what you see in your feed. The board’s decisions are carried out by employees of the local library, who act as caretakers of the community, always on hand to help classify, curate and add context to information.

This is in stark contrast to Facebook, whose advertising-based business model requires the company to maximize user engagement for profit, which in turn makes it a haven for sensationalist propaganda that drives clicks. Deprivatized social media could optimize for a different set of goals.
Your site might be small, but it’s not isolated. It connects with others to form a broader federation, using the same basic principle as email. (For instance, Gmail and Yahoo Mail are distinct services with distinct features, but users can still exchange messages.) Similarly, you can read posts from, and trade messages with, users from other sites and networks around the world. Your community’s governance is local, but its reach is global. It is a self-organized cell within the wider body of the internet.
What about your data? As you click the links in your feed and are transported to other corners of the web, you can be confident that your privacy is secure. That’s because the rights to your personal data are held by a cooperatively owned data trust.
You and the other members get to decide under what conditions an online service has access to your data, and under what conditions more data can be created. For instance, your trust might choose to ban the sort of sweeping surveillance that is so integral to online advertising.
You’ve finished your coffee, and it’s time to get to work. Maybe you don’t live near public transit, so you use an app to call a shared ride. The service is a cooperative, owned by its workers. Unlike Uber and Lyft drivers, these worker-owners have meaningful control over the conditions of their work — they even helped design the app and the algorithms that coordinate their labor.

This is one possible future for a deprivatized internet. It’s closer than you think: some of the elements are already emerging in rudimentary form.
For example, programmers like Darius Kazemi — the author of a step-by-step guide to starting a small-scale social media site — are building new kinds of online spaces, with a more deliberate and more democratic approach to content moderation. Another example is Mastodon, an open-source software project that enables people to run their own social media servers and link them together into a federation. The Drivers Cooperative is a driver-owned ride-hailing cooperative that opened last year in New York City; it has more than 6,000 drivers and does hundreds of trips a day.
But the internet isn’t just apps and sites and platforms. It also consists of the physical infrastructure that makes it possible for you to get online in the first place: the pipes of the internet. Some, like MAREA, carry data across oceans; most carry data across shorter distances. Here too the consequences of corporate dictatorship have been disastrous.
Americans pay some of the most expensive rates in the world in exchange for awful service — the United States ranks 14th in average connection speeds, right below Hungary and Thailand.
The reason for the pitiful state of U.S. broadband is that the high fees extracted from users aren’t being reinvested to build better infrastructure, but to enrich executives and investors. Comcast’s chief executive earned $36.4 million in 2019, and the company — along with the other big firms — has spent billions of dollars on dividends and stock buybacks to line the pockets of its shareholders. Companies like Comcast are essentially slumlords. They charge exorbitant prices for access to their deteriorating infrastructure because people have no alternative.

Those who suffer most from a profit-driven system belong to communities that are too poor or too rural to merit the attention of the broadband monopolists. They are ignored because more money can be made elsewhere.
In 2018, Microsoft researchers found that 162.8 million Americans — almost half the country — do not use the internet at broadband speeds. If profit is the principle that determines how connectivity is distributed, millions will be forced to go without it.
Deprivatization can help here, too. Across the country, hundreds of publicly and cooperatively owned “community networks” are developing an alternative to the market-first model. Harvard researchers found that such networks “generally charge less for entry-level broadband service” than private providers. This is because they don’t exist to enrich investors; their rates reflect the prioritization of social needs, such as universal connectivity, over profits.
This makes them uniquely effective in places where profits are hard to maximize: places like rural North Dakota, which boasts some of the best access to high-speed broadband in the country, thanks to its cooperatives.
Rural cooperatives like those in North Dakota are granted a federal tax exemption as 501(c)(12) organizations, which are owned and governed by their members. To retain their exemption, they must operate at cost: They can cover the expenses incurred by providing service, but any excess revenue must be returned to the membership. They must also guarantee democratic control by holding regular elections for the board.

Ultimately, this is what distinguishes community networks from their corporate rivals: It’s not solely the fact of public or cooperative ownership, but the forms of democratic governance that these alternative ownership models make possible. To put people over profit, you need to create spaces where the people can rule.
These experiments are necessarily limited, however. If there’s any hope of their cohering into a radically new arrangement, they must be refined and expanded through public investment.
The scale and complexity of the internet mean there is no silver bullet for creating a democratic digital future. The precise contours of a democratic internet can be discovered only through a democratic process — through people coming together to build the world they want.
There is plenty of wisdom out there to draw from. There are many organizers and scholars who have thought deeply about digital injustice, and many communities that have acquired valuable expertise on the subject from their own encounters with it.
Even so, questions will remain: how to end algorithmic racism, for instance, or the right way to handle content moderation. Liberating the internet from the constraints of the profit motive won’t make these questions go away. It will, however, create the conditions in which the answers can be found. Perhaps then the submerged threads of glass that carry our data across oceans can make the world smaller without making it worse.

2022-06-01,"Elon Musk is demanding that his workers return to the office.
Mr. Musk, the world’s richest man, sent a pair of similar memos on Tuesday to push his employees at SpaceX, the rocket company he runs, and Tesla, the electric carmaker he leads, to spend time in the office.
In his email to SpaceX employees, Mr. Musk told workers that they were required to “spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week.” Those who did not do so would be fired, he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times.
“The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,” Mr. Musk said. “That is why I spent so much time in the factory — so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, SpaceX would long ago have gone bankrupt.”
In his memo to Tesla’s executive staff, which was posted by two pro-Tesla Twitter accounts and which the billionaire appeared to confirm, Mr. Musk also wrote that “anyone who wishes to do remote work” must be in the office for a minimum of 40 hours a week. Those who decline should “depart Tesla,” he added.

With his twin notes, Mr. Musk waded directly into a fractious debate over the right way for corporations to bring workers back to the office during the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past couple of years, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and many other companies have announced and then delayed return-to-office dates as coronavirus surges have complicated plans. Remote work has become normalized.
The issue has become more fraught as coronavirus vaccinations have increased and an abatement of the pandemic seemed to be near. Some companies began saying they expected workers to return to the office. Still, plans have continued to fluctuate. Apple last month suspended its requirement that employees return to the office in May for at least three days a week because of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. Airbnb recently told its employees that they never had to return to the office.
Mr. Musk, Tesla and SpaceX did not return requests for comment.
Many employees at Tesla and SpaceX had already been back in the office to some extent. In 2020, as “nonessential” workplaces in California closed their doors during the early days of the pandemic, SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., used its exemption as a government contractor to remain open. In a March 2020 email, which was earlier reported by BuzzFeed News, Mr. Musk told SpaceX employees that they had a higher risk of being killed in a car crash than dying from the coronavirus.
In May 2020, Mr. Musk also attacked local officials in the San Francisco Bay Area for not letting him reopen Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif. Tesla sued Alameda County, where the factory is situated, and reopened it anyway, in defiance of health officials’ instructions.

Tesla, which had more than 99,000 employees at the end of last year, has moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Palo Alto, Calif., though it still has a significant manufacturing and operational presence in California. SpaceX employs about 12,000 people, Mr. Musk said in a recent interview.
Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, said Mr. Musk’s directives to employees at SpaceX and Tesla were among the strictest of tech companies. Many tech companies have instead considered hybrid models in which employees can work from home for part of the time, he said.
Mr. Bloom said he expected SpaceX and Tesla to lose about 10 percent to 20 percent of their current work forces and for recruiters to try to poach employees by offering jobs with more flexible work options.
Many Tesla and SpaceX employees who work in cutting-edge tech may believe in Mr. Musk, but there are also people “who are in more common activities like I.T., finance, H.R. and payroll,” Mr. Bloom said. “They may say: ‘I’m not designing cars. I’m doing the payroll of employees, and I can do that somewhere else.’”
Annie Dean, the head of distributed work for Atlassian, an Australian software company, called Mr. Musk’s view “outdated.”

“This mind-set is regressive and discounts the last two years of collaborative, digital-first work,” said Ms. Dean, who was a former head of remote work at Meta, the owner of Facebook, in an email.
Mr. Musk has long been known as a demanding boss. At times, he tried setting an example for hard work, taking meetings late into the night, sending emails at all hours and even sleeping at the Tesla factory to help ramp up production in 2018.
It is unclear if Mr. Musk will adhere to his own rules of spending 40 hours a week in Tesla’s and SpaceX’s offices. He is rarely in the office and often travels, said two people who have worked with him and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They expressed concerns about how the return-to-office policies would affect recruiting and retention at the companies.
Mr. Musk is also closing a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. He has not said what he expects of Twitter employees in terms of time spent in the office. In 2020, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive at the time, informed employees that many of them would be allowed to work from home permanently.
Adrian Zamora, a Twitter spokesman, said Twitter had no plans to change its policy on flexible work.
In his email to SpaceX employees on Tuesday, Mr. Musk suggested that companies that didn’t require workers to return to the office would not be able to ship “a great new product.”

“SpaceX has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company in space,” he said. “This will not happen by phoning it in.”

2022-06-02,"Phil Knight, a founder of the athletic apparel company Nike, and Alan Smolinisky, an entrepreneur and part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, have submitted a bid to purchase the Portland Trail Blazers, according to people familiar with their bid.
The offer from Knight and Smolinisky to purchase the Trail Blazers, an N.B.A. team, is for more than $2 billion, and was submitted in recent weeks, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the offer was private.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Blazers said: “An offer was made by Phil Knight. The team remains not for sale.”
The Trail Blazers are owned by a trust controlled by the family of Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder who died in 2018. Knight and Smolinisky have been in conversations with Jody Allen, Paul Allen’s sister and the chair of the trust, about a potential deal in recent weeks, the people said.

The trust also owns the N.F.L.’s Seattle Seahawks.
How close the parties might be to an agreement was unclear. A person close to Blazers ownership with knowledge of the company’s operations insisted the team was not for sale.
Paul Allen purchased the Blazers in 1988 for $70 million. The value of major sports franchises has risen over the decades, owing in part to the appreciation of media rights, meaning that the team could sell for billions. The last N.B.A. team to trade hands, the Minnesota Timberwolves, sold with the Minnesota Lynx, a W.N.B.A. team, for $1.5 billion.
The English soccer club Chelsea was sold for $3.1 billion last month, while the Denver Broncos are for sale and expected to fetch an N.F.L.-record price. The Broncos are also being sold by a trust after the death of the team’s longtime owner, Pat Bowlen, in 2019.
Jody Allen has said little about her plans for the Blazers, and Chris McGowan, who was the team’s president until November, said in September that the team was not for sale. Still, it has been widely expected that the Blazers would eventually be put up for sale.
Allen did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Knight, 84, who co-founded Nike in 1964, has long been Oregon’s richest person and has a net worth in the tens of billions of dollars. He is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of Nike, but remains on the company’s board. Despite his deep involvement in sports, Knight has never owned a team, and in 2011 he even told a reporter that he specifically was not interested in owning the Blazers.

Knight’s involvement could suggest that there are no plans to relocate the Blazers from Portland, Ore., as has occasionally been suggested over the years. At a news conference before Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals between Golden State and the Boston Celtics on Thursday, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver said “at some point, the team will be sold,” but that he did not know when.

“Portland has been a wonderful community for the N.B.A.,” Silver said. “The team has been there over 50 years now, and our preference, my preference, would be that that team remain in Portland as part of this process.”
Smolinisky, a real estate entrepreneur based in Los Angeles, joined the Dodgers ownership group in 2019.
Little is known about what Paul Allen might have stipulated for the future of the team before his death. But generally, while an individual owner can sell a team to anybody for any reason, trustees have a stricter fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the trust. Any sale of the team would also have to be approved by three-quarters of the N.B.A.’s owners.
The Blazers used to be one of the N.B.A.’s highest spending teams, and at one point Paul Allen said that he had lost hundreds of millions of dollars operating the franchise. But the low initial purchase price means the team can be sold for many multiples of Allen’s original $70 million investment, speaking to the enduring financial windfall of owning a major professional sports franchise.

Buying sports teams in past decades was often as emotional of a decision as it was financial, with teams often run more like family businesses with strong ties to a region. Over the past two decades, however, team valuations have exploded, revenue streams like media agreements and arena naming rights deals have grown in value, and deep-pocketed investor groups from the world of tech and private equity have bid for teams.
If the Blazers were sold, the new ownership group would inherit a team looking for a new direction after a tumultuous year. Last summer, the Blazers hired Chauncey Billups as their head coach, renewing questions surrounding a sexual assault accusation made against him when he was a player. McGowan resigned in November. The next month, the team’s general manager, Neil Olshey, was fired after a workplace misconduct investigation that found unspecified violations.
On the court, the Blazers limped to a 27-55 record as the star guard Damian Lillard played just 29 games because of injuries, and his backcourt partner, CJ McCollum, was traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in February. The Blazers missed the playoffs, but the Pelicans, fueled by McCollum, made a surprising push into the playoffs, where they lost in the first round."
2022-06-03,"When Sheryl Sandberg said this week that she was resigning as chief operating officer of Meta, she also reflected on her legacy as a woman in tech.
“I’m especially proud that this is a company where many, many exceptional women and people from diverse backgrounds have risen through our ranks and become leaders — both in our company and in leadership roles elsewhere,” she wrote in an announcement posted on her Facebook and Instagram pages.
Yet even as Ms. Sandberg lauded the progress of women at Meta, the broader reality for female leaders at the top of the tech industry has been far more disappointing. And with her exit this fall, Silicon Valley is losing one of its most visible and outspoken female executives, leaving few — some would say zero — similar peers in her wake.
Ms. Sandberg, 52, was part of a cohort of women at major tech companies who made keynote speeches, rose to the level of founders like Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg, and had a seat at the table at high-powered business gatherings like the Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. But over the years, many of these women — including Marissa Mayer of Yahoo, Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Ginni Rometty of IBM — have departed, often with their reputations in tatters.

More broadly, women have not made notable gains in recent years in the highest echelons of Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta and other tech giants where the corridors of power continue to be dominated by men. The industry’s record on female leadership trails that of other industries, even as tech exerts more influence in the global economy and in people’s lives.
“The C.E.O. is the face of the company,” and in the tech industry, “somehow collectively the world seems to want the face to be a white man,” said Jenny Lefcourt, co-founder of All Raise, a nonprofit focused on advancing gender and racial equality, and an investor at Freestyle Capital.
At Silicon Valley’s top 150 firms by revenue, 4.8 percent were led by women at the end of 2020, unchanged from 2018, according to a report by the law firm Fenwick & West. In contrast, the percentage of female chief executives of companies in the S&P 500 index rose to 6 percent at the end of 2020 from 4.8 percent in 2018.
Some women in positions of power at publicly traded tech companies, such as Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s general counsel, have become targets of harassment. Others, such as Françoise Brougher, a former chief operating officer of Pinterest, have sued for discrimination. And in recent years, female tech leaders have often appeared to be hired to clean up someone else’s mess, leading to the term “glass cliff,” a play on “glass ceiling” and a reference to the high risks of the roles.
Some women now in charge of public tech companies include Safra Catz of Oracle, Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices and Sarah Friar of Nextdoor, though they have tended to be more private than Ms. Sandberg.

Alphabet, which owns Google, and Microsoft also have women in their executive suites, such as their chief financial officers (Ruth Porat at Alphabet, Amy Hood at Microsoft), and those heading up business units, including Susan Wojcicki at YouTube. A generation of tech start-ups are also led by women, such as Melanie Perkins at the design software maker Canva and Fidji Simo at the delivery company Instacart.

But women still face obstacles in nearly every facet of the tech ecosystem. Annual diversity reports published by Amazon, Google and Apple show incremental gains for women in leadership. Venture capital firms remain dominated by men, while female founders garner a tiny portion of funding. Stories about toxic workplaces, discrimination and harassment continue reverberating throughout Silicon Valley.
“If we stay at this current rate of progress, it will take way beyond our lifetimes to get to parity,” Ms. Lefcourt said. “We need exponential change from here.”
Ms. Lefcourt attributed the minimal progress to the tech industry’s systemic unconscious biases, which she said were especially strong when risky start-ups were just beginning. She also cited the paucity of visible examples of what success looks like for women in the industry.

Since at least the 1930s, the biggest tech companies have been led by men. David Packard and Bill Hewlett famously founded Hewlett-Packard in a Silicon Valley garage in 1939, and chip companies such as Fairchild Semiconductor in the 1950s were spearheaded by men. Even in the 1990s, when Carly Fiorina was appointed the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, female leaders in Silicon Valley were rare.
In the internet era, some women were tapped to lead, including Carol Bartz, the former Autodesk chief executive who became Yahoo’s chief executive in 2009. Other women joined start-ups like Google, which soon ballooned. When Ms. Sandberg left her job as a Google vice president for Facebook in 2008, she helped create a new archetype of an experienced female executive who was helping to professionalize start-ups founded by men. (Facebook was renamed Meta last year.)
“It wasn’t that she was just a C.O.O. — Mark made sure she was truly elevated in stature,” said Emilie Choi, the chief operating officer of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, referring to Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. Ms. Choi said she and other women in tech used Ms. Sandberg’s template to work alongside tech founders.
In 2013, Ms. Sandberg published her best-selling business manifesto, “Lean In,” which encouraged women to grab opportunities and to more aggressively seek promotions and raises.
The difficulties that women faced in tech were highlighted by Ellen Pao, a venture capital investor who sued her employer, Kleiner Perkins, for discrimination in 2012. She lost the case in 2015, but the high-profile trial showed the ills of Silicon Valley’s boys club. Ms. Pao has since created Project Include, a nonprofit focused on diversity and inclusion.

Ms. Pao said that while more people now believed women and others when they spoke up about discrimination and harassment, tech companies hadn’t done much to improve their workplaces.
“We don’t get many metrics on diversity and inclusion, and the ones that are shared show little progress, especially at the executive levels,” she said.
In the aftermath of her trial, tech companies began releasing annual diversity reports outlining the gender and racial disparities in their workforces. Venture capital firms, many of them with only male partners, added women to their partnerships.
At public tech companies, more women were named to executive jobs. Ursula Burns was elevated to Xerox’s chief executive in 2009. Ms. Mayer became Yahoo’s chief executive in 2012 after a long career at Google, while Ms. Rometty was named IBM’s chief executive that same year. In 2014, Ms. Catz became co-chief executive at Oracle. Microsoft appointed Ms. Hood chief financial officer in 2013, while Google hired Ms. Porat as chief financial officer in 2015.
But many of them encountered difficulties steering aging tech companies. Of those women, only Ms. Catz, Ms. Hood and Ms. Porat remain in their roles.

“The snail’s pace of progress for women leaders in Silicon Valley is worse than disappointing,” said Nicole Wong, a deputy chief technology officer for the Obama administration and a former Twitter executive. “It makes the commitments that tech leaders made around racial and gender diversity in 2014 look performative.”

In 2017, stories of sexual harassment by powerful men in Silicon Valley became part of the #MeToo movement. That year, a group of female investors created All Raise.
In 2018, California passed a law requiring publicly traded companies to have at least one female board director, leading to scores of women joining corporate boards. (A California judge struck down the law last month; the state has said it will appeal the ruling.) Another new law, passed last year, the Silenced No More Act, provides legal protection for people who speak publicly about discrimination or harassment they experienced at work.
Women in tech have continued speaking out about unfair treatment. In 2020, Ms. Brougher reached a $22.5 million settlement with Pinterest for discrimination and retaliation. A discrimination lawsuit by Emily Kramer, a former chief marketing officer at the financial start-up Carta, is working its way through the courts.
There have been some signs of progress. Over the past five years, Katrina Lake of Stitch Fix, Julie Wainwright of The RealReal, Jennifer Hyman of Rent the Runway and Whitney Wolfe Herd of Bumble took the companies they founded public. And following in Ms. Sandberg’s footsteps, female chief operating officers are now more common in tech. They include Ms. Choi at Coinbase, Gwynne Shotwell at SpaceX and Jen Wong at Reddit.
At Meta, Ms. Sandberg hired and promoted women, such as Marne Levine, the chief business officer, and Lori Goler, the head of human resources and hiring. The percentage of women in Meta’s management with titles of director or higher increased to 35 percent in 2021, from 30 percent in 2018, according to the company’s data.

Meta also developed women who now lead other tech companies, including Ms. Simo, who oversaw the main Facebook app before becoming Instacart’s chief executive last year.
“Sheryl’s leadership has really mattered to a lot of us,” said Kate Rouch, the chief marketing officer of Coinbase, who was an employee at Meta until August.
But when Ms. Sandberg leaves her job in the next few months, Javier Olivan, a longtime Meta executive, will take over the role of chief operating officer. Mr. Olivan will be one of four top deputies to Mr. Zuckerberg focused on technology and policy — and all of them are men."

2022-06-06,"CUPERTINO, Calif. — More than two years into the coronavirus pandemic, Apple made a big push on Monday to return to normalcy by inviting hundreds of software developers and journalists to its campus for an unveiling of a range of new software features that expand the iPhone’s utility.
Over a two-hour presentation, Apple revealed a buy-now-pay-later program that splits a purchase over several months, much like programs offered by PayPal and others. It also said it was expanding the ability to use an iPhone to unlock doors to apartments, hotel rooms and rental cars. And it introduced a version of CarPlay that would take over a vehicle’s entire dashboard, providing speed and fuel information as well as maps and music.
Collectively, the new features show how Tim Cook, the chief executive, is still finding ways to expand the usefulness and longevity of Apple’s most important product while wringing more sales out of it through features that thrust the company deeper into adjacent industries such as finance, real estate and autos.
“They are the digital control center, and they are extending their reach as more and more devices are digitized,” said Bob O’Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research, a firm specializing in tech research. “Much of this is not going to change the world, but they are enhancements that give a little freshness that people appreciate.”
The software updates continue a yearslong lull in the introduction of a new product category from a company that its co-founder Steve Jobs made synonymous with revolutionary new devices. Apple last unveiled a new product category, wearables, in 2014 when it introduced the Apple Watch.
The pandemic has helped increase sales of Apple’s legacy products. Students and employees forced to work from home found value in upgrading to the latest versions of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Many turned to video games and subscriptions for Apple TV+, helping increase the company’s sales last year by 33 percent to $366 billion."

Harvey Weinstein, Larry Nassar, Bill Cosby: If there is a standard metric by which the progress of the #MeToo movement has been measured, it is the conviction of high-profile men accused by women and girls of sex crimes.
Small wonder, then, that the defamation case between the actors Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, which turned on Heard’s self-description in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed as a representative of domestic abuse, has been read as a low-water mark for the movement: After and even before the jury found last week that each had defamed the other, awarding $2 million in damages to Heard and $10 million to Depp, commentators were declaring “the death” and “the end” of #MeToo.
Nearly five years after its viral spread on social media prompted an international reckoning with the prevalence of sexual abuse and discrimination, particularly in the workplace, #MeToo still looms large in the cultural imagination. But to what extent has it actually succeeded in remedying the inequalities that compelled its formation, and should the Depp-Heard verdict be taken as an indication of the movement’s waning power? Here’s what people are saying.
The rise and fall of #MeToo
As Moira Donegan writes in The Guardian, the backlash to #MeToo is nearly as old as the movement itself: Even in its early days, criticism abounded that it was “excessive and intemperate” or had “gone too far.”
Yet for all the resistance it met, #MeToo hasn’t actually done much to curtail sexual harassment and abuse, in the view of Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who focuses on the First Amendment and technology.
“When we look at the people who have had serious accusations made against them — one of the ones is a Supreme Court justice — most of the accused men in Hollywood have gotten their jobs back, or people are doing their comeback tours like nothing really happened,” she told Politico."

A push to reinvigorate U.S. chip-making.

The billionaires pressing Biden on chip-making
A group of billionaires has quietly assembled a push to get Washington to spend $1 billion on a new initiative to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing back to the U.S. Eric Schmidt, former C.E.O. of Google and longtime Democratic donor, and Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, are both backers of the idea. They and others recently started an unusual nonprofit venture capital fund, called America’s Frontier Fund, to invest in American chip-making, and want taxpayers to help foot the bill, DealBook’s Ephrat Livni reports.

Semiconductors are the subject of deep national security anxieties. They’re a foundational technology of modern life, not just in obviously digital devices but in everything from cars to military equipment. Over half the world’s chip-making capacity — and far more for the most advanced designs — is in Taiwan, which faces growing pressure from mainland China, itself an increasingly powerful player in the industry. As of 2020, according to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association, the U.S. had 12 percent of global manufacturing capacity.
The new venture group has strong ties both in Washington and on Wall Street. It leads what the White House has described as “an independent consortium of investors” across the Quad, the China-countering security partnership between the U.S., Japan, India and Australia. The fund’s C.E.O., Gilman Louie, is a former video games executive turned venture capitalist who led In-Q-Tel, a C.I.A.-backed venture fund. He was recently named to President Biden’s Intelligence Advisory Board and is expected to testify before senators on strengthening supply chains.
The fund has raised more than a few eyebrows. Its backers have a lot of other potentially connected interests. Schmidt has been criticized for having too much influence in the Biden and Obama administrations; Thiel was thought to have Trump’s ear. “I’m not sure what that organization can accomplish that the U.S. government can’t accomplish itself,” said Gaurav Gupta, an emerging tech analyst at the industry research firm Gartner.
But the fund’s Louie said the skepticism wasn’t warranted: “If anything, we need more Eric Schmidts to get involved, not stand on the sidelines,” he said. “We need more technologists who have influence.”
At stake is U.S. primacy in the global innovation race. The risk of inaction, industry experts say, is that China’s recent tech investments will put Chinese technology, and perhaps even ideology, in first place. “In our current trajectory, the U.S. is losing its grip,” said Edlyn Levine, a quantum physicist and one of the fund’s founders. She added, “Whoever leads has a first mover advantage and actually will dominate in that sector the same way the United States did in early semiconductors.”
Is this the right group to help build up chip capacity? That’s a question being asked by the fund’s skeptics. The founders say they are committed, whether or not they get federal funding, and they have also started a related fund raising money from nonprofits. “I don’t need the government to give us permission to go save the country,” Louie said. “It’d be nice if they would help us.”

The U.S.’s top antitrust cop is ready for action  
Nearly a year into her job as chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan’s record has lacked a signature action against the industry, and she hasn’t made the splash that many expected.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Khan was appointed by President Biden to shake up an agency that has long quivered at the power of the tech giants, but Republican lawmakers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have also fought her at every turn, describing her as anti-business and overbearing. At the F.T.C., staff morale has plummeted, according to a recent survey, and senior officials have left.
That may change now that she has a Democratic majority. Last month, Congress confirmed Alvaro Bedoya as the F.T.C.’s fifth commissioner, giving Democrats 3-2 control of the agency’s leadership. In a 20-minute interview this week with The Times’s Cecilia Kang over Zoom, she said she was preparing to unleash an aggressive agenda and “the best is yet to come.”
Focusing on dominant actors in markets is going to be a priority, she said. “You can expect to see big lawsuits,” she said. “We’re definitely focusing our resources on litigating. With limited resources, we’re having to focus on what we see as some of the biggest problems.”
Asked whether her work could really rein in tech, which often outpaces rule-making and policy, she said that a lot of the work the agency had done had “broadened the aperture” for understanding, recognizing and diagnosing harm. She said her aim was to anticipate problems down the line and take swift action.
“I think this goes back to being attentive to these next-generation technologies and next-generation innovations in nascent industries across sectors,” Khan said. “Those can really help us tackle problems at the inception.”
A key focus for Khan is reviewing merger guidelines. These are internal rules that the F.T.C. follows in its reviews of mergers alongside the Justice Department. Khan said these rules needed to be “fully adhering to existing law” while also accurately reflecting the ways companies “illegally acquire” power to fend off competition. “We’re going to continue enforcing the law vigorously, prohibiting illegal mergers, prohibiting unlawful business practices,” she said.
“As much as we grumbled about going back to work, we all understood that it was going to happen. But the second we started going, we realized how silly it was.”

A new low-interest loan for U.S. immigrants
In the long, long road to U.S. citizenship, immigrants face hefty financial obstacles. All in, including green card, application for citizenship, legal fees and payments for processors, at least one estimate puts the cost of citizenship at as much as $11,000.
A new program, financed by BlueHub Capital, aims to address that cost. It offers a 1 percent interest loan to immigrants eligible to apply for citizenship. There are nine million immigrants eligible for citizenship in the U.S., BlueHub estimates, but the program has started small. Since it began in March, about 70 people have applied, according to Elyse Cherry, BlueHub’s C.E.O.
“We have built this to be a scalable model, so we expect it to work with thousands and thousands of borrowers,” Cherry told DealBook. “What we’re really trying to do here is to build out a community of immigrants and all of the folks from the country who support them.” The loan has no credit requirements or late or hidden fees.
Many immigrants already take out loans to cover costs associated with the citizenship process, but usually at very high fees. A survey conducted by a group affiliated with BlueHub of more than 1,200 people, found that 90 percent of immigrants borrowed to pay for citizenship. Two-thirds of borrowers said they drew on high-interest financing such as credit cards or payday lenders. A 2018 study by Stanford University researchers found that subsidies could make a significant difference. According to the study, low-income immigrants who received fee vouchers to assist with the application cost naturalized at double the rate of those who did not.
Compared with Canada, Australia and Britain, the percentage of immigrants to the U.S. who become citizens is low. And U.S. naturalization rates have declined markedly between 1970 and 2011, the Stanford study found. This matters because citizenship is associated with economic and social gains, both for individuals and for the places where they live. Gaining legal status generally leads to better job prospects, higher incomes and higher rates of homeownership, research has shown. And that’s on top of all the other rights and benefits of citizenship.
Luiz Sebastião Machado, a 72-year-old from Brazil who fixes vacuum cleaners and other equipment, said he was applying for citizenship using the 1 percent loan so he could have access to social security benefits once he retired.
Adina Appelbaum, a co-founder of financial planning firm Immigrant Finance, told DealBook that access to such a loan would make a significant difference to immigrant families. “One of the primary reasons that immigrants cannot apply for citizenship is the high fees,” she said.

2022-06-12,"Google has settled a class-action lawsuit that accused it of systematically underpaying women, promising to provide $118 million in monetary relief and invite outsiders to review its pay practices.
Three former Google employees first sued the company in 2017 in Ellis v. Google LLC, claiming that it paid women less than men for the same job; a fourth plaintiff was added later. A San Francisco Superior Court judge must now approve the Friday settlement, which covers about 15,500 women employed in California by Google in 236 different job titles since Sept. 14, 2013.
For Google, which prides itself on an egalitarian ethos, the long-running legal dispute was an uncomfortable subject. It coincided with gender discrimination suits against tech peers Microsoft and Oracle that have had mixed results. The women suing the software company Oracle faced a setback Friday, Bloomberg Law reported earlier, when a judge stripped the plaintiffs of their class-action status.
“While we strongly believe in the equity of our policies and practices, after nearly five years of litigation, both sides agreed that resolution of the matter, without any admission or findings, was in the best interest of everyone,” Chris Pappas, a Google spokesman, said in a statement. “We’re very pleased to reach this agreement.” Google has analyzed pay equity over the last nine years and raised employees’ pay when warranted, he added.

For three years after a formal approval of the settlement, Google will let third-party experts assess how it could improve its pay equity process and be fairer when establishing rank and pay for new hires. There will also be an external monitor to assess whether the company is following the experts’ recommendations, according to firms representing the plaintiffs, Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein and Altshuler Berzon.
“As a woman who’s spent her entire career in the tech industry, I’m optimistic that the actions Google has agreed to take as part of this settlement will ensure more equity for women,” Holly Pease, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement."
2022-06-13,"Microsoft and the Communications Workers of America union announced an agreement on Monday that would make it easier for employees to unionize at the video game maker Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is acquiring for $70 billion.
Under the deal, which appears to be the first of its kind in the technology industry, Microsoft agreed to remain neutral if any of Activision’s eligible U.S. employees want to unionize, and employees would no longer have to petition the National Labor Relations Board for an election. The company has almost 7,000 employees in the United States, most of whom will be eligible to unionize under the arrangement.
A group of nearly 30 employees at one of Activision’s studios voted to unionize through an N.L.R.B. election in May despite Activision’s opposition to holding the election. But completing such a process can be time consuming, with unions and employers sometimes spending months or even years litigating the results.
Through the agreement, workers will have access to an expedited process for unionizing, overseen by a neutral third party, in which they will indicate their support for a union either by signing cards or confidentially through an electronic platform.

“This process does gives us and Microsoft a way to do this quote unquote election without spending the time, the effort and the controversy that goes along with an N.L.R.B. election,” Chris Shelton, the president of the Communications Workers union, said in an interview.
The union said that the neutrality agreement resolved the antitrust concerns it had with the acquisition, and that it now supported the deal, which Microsoft has said will close by the end of next June.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Mr. Shelton and Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, suggested that the deal could pave the way to wider unionization across the company and the industry. “This is a great opportunity for us to work with Chris and the C.W.A. and to learn and innovate,” Mr. Smith said in an interview. Microsoft said it was prepared to “build on” the deal in the future, but did not specifically comment on whether it planned to extend the terms to other gaming workers at the company.
Microsoft indicated that under the agreement, it would refrain from an aggressive anti-union campaign if other Activision employees sought to unionize. “In practical terms, it means that we’re not going to try to jump in and put a thumb on the scale,” Mr. Smith said in the interview. “We will respect the fact that our employees are capable of making decisions for themselves and they have a right to do that.”

Facing their own union campaigns, companies like Amazon and Starbucks have held frequent mandatory meetings with employees to argue that a union could leave them worse off.

The labor board has issued complaints against Amazon that include accusations of threatening workers with a loss of benefits if they unionize, and against Starbucks over accusations that it fired workers who sought to form a union and effectively promised benefits to workers if they chose not to unionize. Both companies have denied the accusations. In a recent case brought by the N.L.R.B. in Arizona, a federal judge denied a request for an injunction to reinstate pro-union workers whom the labor board said Starbucks had forced out illegally.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The agreement between Microsoft and the union would also protect workers’ right to communicate among themselves and with union officials about a union campaign — something many employers seek to discourage — and stipulates that disagreements between the company and the union will be resolved through an “expedited arbitration process.” N.L.R.B. complaints can take months or years to resolve.
When Microsoft and Activision announced their blockbuster deal in January, the game maker was under stress as it faced accusations that senior executives had ignored sexual harassment and discrimination. Those concerns spurred organizing among Activision employees, including workers at its Raven Software studio in Wisconsin, which has developed games in popular franchises like Call of Duty.
After a group of roughly 30 quality assurance, or Q.A., workers announced that they were seeking to unionize, Activision sought to convince the federal labor board that their election should not go forward. The game workers accused Activision of union-busting tactics, like increasing the pay of non-Raven Q.A. workers and splitting Q.A. workers up by embedding them across the Raven studio.

Activision maintained that while some changes in this vein had come after the union campaign went public, the broader shift in approach had already been underway — for example, its move to change the status of hundreds of temporary and contingent workers to permanent full-time employees in the fall.
The company argued that the entire Raven studio, comprising hundreds of workers, should have been allowed to vote on forming a union, rather than just a few dozen Q.A. workers. Q.A. employees, often on temporary contracts, are commonly considered the most overworked and underpaid members of game studios.
In early March, the union signed a letter asking federal regulators to scrutinize the acquisition. “The potential takeover by Microsoft threatens to further undermine workers’ rights and suppress wages,” the letter said.
Microsoft has since tried to strike a conciliatory tone. It said it would not stop Activision from voluntarily recognizing the union before a formal election, which Activision did not do. After the Raven Q.A. workers voted in late May to form the first union at a major North American game publisher, Phil Spencer, the head of gaming at Microsoft, told employees that he would recognize the Raven union once the deal between the two companies closed, the gaming news site Kotaku reported, citing a video of an employee town hall.
Activision said on Friday that it was starting contract negotiations with the newly unionized Raven workers. “We decided to take this important step forward with our 27 represented employees and C.W.A. to explore their ideas and insights for how we might better serve our employees, players and other stakeholders,” Bobby Kotick, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement.

In a blog post this month that appeared to foreshadow the deal, Mr. Smith announced a set of principles to guide Microsoft’s response to labor organizing, an indication that it was taking a more open approach across the company’s businesses.
He wrote that he had observed Microsoft’s successful “collaborative experiences with works councils and unions” while working in Europe and said that in the United States the company would pursue “collaborative approaches that will make it simpler, rather than more difficult, for our employees to make informed decisions and to exercise their legal right to choose whether to form or join a union.”
In the interview, Mr. Smith called the neutrality agreement “our first opportunity to put those principles into practice.”
The Communications Workers of America, which represents employees at companies like AT&T Mobility, Verizon and The New York Times, has sought to organize tech industry workers in recent years. It has begun organizing retail workers at Apple Stores and helped workers at Google form a so-called minority union, which allows them to act together on workplace issues without having to win a union election.
About a dozen retail employees at Google Fiber stores in Kansas City, Mo., who are formally employed by a Google contractor, recently voted to join the union.

U.S. promises $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine
Amid increasingly urgent calls from Ukraine, President Biden yesterday announced an additional $1 billion in weapons and aid for the war-torn country. Overall, the U.S. has now committed about $5.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. Germany, Slovakia, Canada, Poland and the Netherlands have also pledged more artillery. Follow the latest updates.
The promise of additional aid came as the U.S. and its allies sought to present a united front against the Kremlin. The war in Ukraine has radically altered the strategic calculus in Europe. Nearly four months in, some fissures are emerging over the end game of an increasingly intractable conflict as Europe grapples with the economic fallout from the war, including rising inflation and gas prices.
Though the U.S. has said it will not pressure Kyiv into negotiations, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, yesterday said that the conflict would eventually have to end with talks. “At some point, when we will have done our maximum to help Ukraine resist — when, I hope, it will have won and the firing has ceased — we will have to negotiate,” he said.

Fed hikes interest rates
The Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in the largest increase since 1994, signaling that it is prepared to inflict economic pain to get inflation under control. The rate increase could be followed by a similarly sized move next month, officials said.
Increasing interest rates will make buying a home or expanding a business more expensive, restraining spending and slowing the broader economy. Officials expect growth to moderate in the coming months and years. Unemployment is forecast to rise about half a percentage point to 4.1 percent by late 2024 as Fed policy squeezes companies and workers.
Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, acknowledged that it was becoming increasingly difficult for the central bank to slow inflation without causing a recession as outside forces, including the war in Ukraine and factory shutdowns in China, threaten to curb the supply of goods and commodities like oil. “The environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months,” he said.
By the numbers: The latest move set the Fed’s policy rate in a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, and more rate increases are to come. Officials expect interest rates to hit 3.4 percent by the end of 2022.

W.H.O. official warns about risks of monkeypox
Dr. Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.’s top official in Europe, yesterday called for urgent action by the authorities and civic groups to control fast-rising cases of monkeypox that he said posed a real risk to public health. More than 1,500 cases have been identified across 25 European countries, accounting for 85 percent of global cases, he said.
“The magnitude of this outbreak poses a real risk,” Dr. Kluge said. “The longer the virus circulates, the more it will extend its reach, and the stronger the disease’s foothold will get in nonendemic countries.” Monkeypox is a viral infection endemic in West Africa, but it has now spread to 39 countries, including 32 that have no previous experience with it.
Infections mostly result from close physical contact, but the virus can also spread through respiratory droplets in prolonged face-to-face contact. The current outbreak has mainly affected men who have sex with men, raising concerns about transmission over a summer of Pride events, music festivals and other mass gatherings. Dr. Kluge said the disease was not a reason to cancel events, but he highlighted the need for awareness.

Next steps: The W.H.O. will meet next week to determine if the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, a formal declaration that calls for a coordinated response from countries.

The fix is in
An explosion of social media stars are teaching followers to flip their furniture — a trend that is perhaps no surprise after a period in which so many people downloaded TikTok to fend off the boredom of being stuck on the couch.
“Flipping,” in this sense, means finding a well-built but aging piece of furniture, refurbishing it — often by sanding, adding fresh paint or varnish and updating its hardware — and reselling it. But many of the people making videos also aim to help viewers improve the furniture already in their homes.
“So many people can’t afford to spend thousands of dollars on furniture,” Christina Clericuzio, a flipper from Connecticut, told The Times. “So it’s fun to show people that they can have these things for less when they D.I.Y.”

2022-06-17,"After the massacre of schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, the gun-control movement was small and badly outspent by the National Rifle Association. Parents seeking an outlet for their grief and rage congregated on Facebook, where they formed their own group, Moms Demand Action, to push for stricter gun laws.
By far the most significant and best-known donor in the years since has been Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York City mayor. In 2013, his mayors’ initiative merged with Moms Demand Action to create Everytown for Gun Safety, the closest thing that the gun-control movement has to a counterweight to the N.R.A. That year the group spent $36.5 million, compared with $4.7 million the year before.
More groups sprang up, including Giffords, started in 2013 by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was nearly killed in a mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., that claimed the lives of six people, and the March for Our Lives, founded by survivors of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla.
As recent progress on a bipartisan gun safety deal on Capitol Hill illustrates, the nascent movement has coalesced into something more formidable. It went from being considered a guaranteed-to-lose issue for Democrats to something candidates organize around, especially on the state level. But because gun control was viewed as particularly divisive, many major philanthropists and big foundations have been reluctant to dive into an issue long seen as not just polarized but intractable.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Yet as gun sales and gun deaths have risen in tandem, and the number of mass shootings continues to increase, including the attacks last month in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas, big donors have begun to move off the sidelines.
“Since Buffalo I have spoken to a dozen large funders who are quickly scrambling to figure out where they can play a role in the current gun violence crisis,” said David Brotherton, vice chair of the Fund for a Safer Future, the largest national donor collaborative working on gun-violence prevention, and a program officer at the Atlanta philanthropy the Kendeda Fund. “This is snowballing right now.”
In addition to moments of crisis, people were trying to make progress where the potential political heat was lower. More and more funders have tried tackling gun violence through the less politically divisive lens of public health, through community intervention and as a matter of racial equity. Big-name philanthropists including Steve and Connie Ballmer of the Ballmer Group and John and Laura Arnold of Arnold Ventures have begun to make tens of millions of dollars in grants on different aspects of gun-violence prevention.
The gun-control movement is better funded than it was a decade ago, but it still is not outspending the N.R.A. Even with recent legal challenges and boardroom battles, the N.R.A. remains a powerful organization with years of success in blocking legislative efforts to restrict gun sales.
It remains to be seen how the bipartisan deal for a narrow set of gun safety measures, an agreement reached by 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats and endorsed by President Biden, will move through the evenly divided Senate.

Money is also only part of the equation. More donors will help the gun-control movement spend on lobbying, research and organizing, and on donations to political candidates who support the cause. But matching the intensity and discipline of gun-rights supporters’ political activism isn’t just about who spends more.
Gun rights are an especially galvanizing issue for many Republican voters, particularly in primaries, and Republicans have been far more likely to use messaging about guns to excite their base than Democrats have for the bulk of this year, though some are increasingly working gun safety into their pitches now.
“It is a much heavier lift than everybody thinks because in attacking this gun thing, you’re taking on the entire identity and ethos of the G.O.P.,” said Ryan Busse, a former executive at the gun company Kimber who is now an industry critic.
Richard Feldman, a former N.R.A. regional political director, said that the gun-control movement might be better organized and funded than in the past but that the politics of the issue still largely favored gun rights.
“Everyone has an opinion about guns, but, come November, it’s the determining issue for gun owners,” Mr. Feldman said.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It is that strength of feeling that helped keep donors away. Liz Dunning, vice president of development at the gun-control group Brady, worked in education nonprofits and philanthropy before switching to gun control. “I know what it looks like when the really big philanthropic players engage, and it looks different from this,” she said.
“What would happen if Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and the Ford Foundation came together and said, ‘We’re not going to live this way anymore, and we’re going to tap the resources that we have right now to make a difference’?” asked Ms. Dunning, whose mother was shot and killed.
But the decade of activism since Sandy Hook has laid the groundwork for change. And the grinding increase in gun violence, not just in high-profile mass shootings but also in domestic violence and suicides, has steadily added to the ranks of small donors and the rolls of volunteers.
According to the legislation tracked by the group Giffords, since the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012, 48 states and the District of Columbia have passed more than 466 gun laws. That includes 22 states that have closed the federal loophole that exempted unlicensed sellers from conducting background checks on some or all firearms purchasers.

“In some cases Congress is the curtain-raiser, and in others it’s the finale. And the truth is, I think it’s going to be the finale here,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, when asked about political will in Washington before the bipartisan gun safety deal was announced. “But if you look at the state-by-state action, that it’s occurred on a bipartisan basis, it shows a pretty remarkable change in political calculus.”

The face of the gun-control movement in the 1980s was James Brady, the White House press secretary who was grievously wounded and permanently disabled when he was shot in 1981 during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. In 1994, Congress passed an assault-weapon ban. After Democrats lost control of the House the same year, guns came to be viewed as a losing issue by many Democrats.
“You had all these centrists in the ’90s who thought guns are the third rail. You can’t do anything about it. You can’t talk about it. Since Newtown, the consensus changed,” said Alex Barrio, director of advocacy for gun violence prevention policy at the Center for American Progress.
The advent of online organizing helped to narrow the N.R.A.’s fund-raising edge. “The ease and the rise of online portals has made a huge difference. Back in the day you had to direct mail, which is a very expensive way to raise money,” said Josh Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.
But the N.R.A. still outspent gun-violence prevention groups on lobbying in Washington with a record $15.8 million in 2021, a factor of five to one, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics.

“It is incontrovertible that gun rights continue to outspend gun control at least at the national level,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director at OpenSecrets. “The gap is certainly closing.”
In 2019, tax records show, the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund raised a record $80.7 million in contributions and grants. That year, Mr. Bloomberg announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. It was also his most generous to date as a philanthropist. His overall giving soared to $3.3 billion from $767 million the year before. According to the group, Mr. Bloomberg gave an extra $35 million at the end of 2019 that was intended for the next year.
Without a major donation from Mr. Bloomberg, the Action Fund raised just $20.3 million in 2020 and ran a $32 million deficit. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment on the timing of his donations to Everytown. Whether it was related to a personal tax bill, his run for president or something else, the organization’s spending wasn’t ultimately affected. The fluctuation does underscore the potential impact of counting too much on one benefactor, said Brian Mittendorf, professor of accounting specializing in nonprofits at the Ohio State University.
“Given the reliance on one donor, the big open question to me is what the plan is for the future,” Mr. Mittendorf said. “Will there be an effort to diversify the revenue stream?”
That would mean more people putting real money into preventing gun violence, which broadly remains a hard sell.

Donors associated with the effective altruism movement, which tries to find the most cost-effective strategies for saving or improving lives, see gun control as costly compared with interventions like mosquito nets to protect against malaria or vaccines to prevent childhood illnesses.
Ms. Dunning, at Brady, pointed to the politics of the issue and a fear among foundations of tackling something they view as polarizing. “In my conversations with smaller-scale foundations, I’ve heard from program officers and others, ‘It’s not one of our strategic priorities.’ ‘Investing in gun-violence prevention makes us nervous,’” she said.
Since the mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde, “I’ve been getting calls from major donors, new donors I’ve never heard from before,” she added, which could herald an increased role for philanthropy in gun violence prevention.
Laurene Powell Jobs’s organization, the Emerson Collective, began giving to gun-violence prevention groups a decade ago, most notably through the nonprofit Chicago CRED. Emerson gives $25 million annually to the group, which does outreach directly to young people in the city who are at risk of shooting or being shot.
This year, the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie, announced more than $20 million in grants to groups working to reduce community gun violence.

Arnold Ventures, the philanthropic arm of the billionaires John and Laura Arnold, started working on gun-violence prevention in 2018, the year of the shooting in Parkland. It made a $20 million gift to start the National Collaborative for Gun Violence Research to try to get data to shape good policy. In 2020, Arnold Ventures also started working on community violence-reduction strategies with an additional $5 million. This month, the group released a new request for proposals for additional research grants.
“So much more needs to be done,” Walter Katz, vice president of criminal justice at Arnold Ventures, said in an interview. “There’s so much work to go around.”"

2022-06-20,"When Google told some small businesses in January that they would no longer be able to use a customized email service and other workplace apps for free, it felt like a broken promise for Richard J. Dalton Jr., a longtime user who operates a scholastic test-prep company in Vancouver, British Columbia.
“They’re basically strong-arming us to switch to something paid after they got us hooked on this free service,” said Mr. Dalton, who first set up a Google work email for his business, Your Score Booster, in 2008.
Google said the longtime users of what it calls its G Suite legacy free edition, which includes email and apps like Docs and Calendar, had to start paying a monthly charge, usually around $6 for each business email address. Businesses that do not voluntarily switch to a paid service by June 27 will be automatically moved to one. If they don’t pay by Aug. 1, their accounts will be suspended.
While the cost of the paid service is more of an annoyance than a hard financial hit, small-business owners affected by the change say they have been disappointed by the ham-handed way that Google has dealt with the process. They can’t help but feel that a giant company with billions of dollars in profits is squeezing little guys — some of the first businesses to use Google’s apps for work — for just a bit of money.

“It struck me as needlessly petty,” said Patrick Gant, the owner of Think It Creative, a marketing consultancy in Ottawa. “It’s hard to feel sorry for someone who received something for free for a long time and now are being told that they need to pay for it. But there was a promise that was made. That’s what compelled me to make the decision to go with Google versus other alternatives.”
Google’s decision to charge organizations that have used its apps for free is another example of its search for ways to get more money out of its existing business, similar to how it has sometimes put four ads atop search results instead of three and has jammed more commercials into YouTube videos. In recent years, Google has more aggressively pushed into selling software subscriptions to businesses and competed more directly with Microsoft, whose Word and Excel programs rule the market.
After a number of the longtime users complained about the change to a paid service, an initial May 1 deadline was delayed. Google also said people using old accounts for personal rather than business reasons could continue to do so for free.
But some business owners said that as they mulled whether to pay Google or abandon its services, they struggled to get in touch with customer support. With the deadline looming, six small-business owners who spoke to The New York Times criticized what they said were confusing and at times vacillating communications about the service change.
“I don’t mind you kicking us off,” said Samad Sajanlal, owner of Supreme Equipment Company, which does software consulting and other tech services in McKinney, Texas. “But don’t give us an unrealistic deadline to go and find an alternative while you’re still deciding if you really want to kick us off in the first place.”

Google said that the free edition didn’t include customer support, but that it provided users with multiple ways to get in touch with the company for help with their transition.
Google launched Gmail in 2004 and business apps such as Docs and Sheets two years later. The search giant was eager for start-ups and mom-and-pop shops to adopt its work software, so it offered the services at no cost and let companies bring custom domains that matched their business names to Gmail.
While it was still testing the apps, it even told business owners that the products would remain free for life, though Google says that from the beginning, the terms of service for its business software stated that the company could suspend or terminate the offering in the future. Google stopped new free sign-ups in December 2012 but continued to support the accounts of what became known as the G Suite legacy free edition.
In 2020, G Suite was rebranded as Google Workspace. The overwhelming majority of people — the company says it has more than three billion total users — use a free version of Workspace. More than seven million organizations or individuals pay for versions with additional tools and customer support, up from six million in 2020. The number of users still on the free legacy version from years ago have numbered in the thousands, said a person familiar with the tally who asked for anonymity because the person was not allowed to publicly disclose those numbers.
“We’re here to help our customers with this transition, including deep discounts on Google Workspace subscriptions,” Katie Wattie, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Moving to a Google Workspace subscription can be done in a few clicks.”

From April 2020 to March 2021, business revenue nearly halved. Sales dropped another 20 percent the next year. Things have started to pick up in recent months, but Your Score Booster is still lagging its prepandemic performance.
“At this point, I’m focused on getting my business to recover,” Mr. Dalton said. “The last thing I want to do is change a service.” So he asked his two part-time employees to start using their personal email addresses for work, and he is considering upgrading the remaining 11 accounts to the cheapest version of Google Workspace.
Mr. Gant’s business is a one-man shop, and he had been using Gmail for free since 2004. He said it wasn’t about the money. His problem was the hassle. He had to figure out whether to continue using Google or find another option.

Mr. Gant is still considering whether to move to Microsoft Outlook, Apple iCloud or ProtonMail, or to stick with Google. He will decide what to do at the end of the month. Microsoft would cost him 100 Canadian dollars a year. Apple would cost $50 and ProtonMail $160. Google would give him three months free and then charge the same amount as Apple for a year. The next year, Google’s price would double.

Mr. Sajanlal, the sole employee of his business, signed up for Gmail’s business service in 2009. Years later, he added his brother-in-law, Mesam Jiwani, to his G Suite account when he started a business of his own. That company, Fast Payment Systems, has helped small businesses in states including Texas and New York to process credit card payments since 2020.
When Mr. Sajanlal told Mr. Jiwani that Google would start to charge for each of their email addresses, Mr. Jiwani said: “Are you serious? They’re going to start ripping us off?”
Mr. Jiwani said he stored transaction data for his 3,000 clients on Google Drive, so he began to pay for the company’s services, though he is considering a switch to the software provider Zoho. Mr. Sajanlal moved away from Google in March, setting up his business emails on Nextcloud.

1. A Jan. 6 panel revealed evidence that Trump was involved in a plan to put forward fake electors.
The committee played deposition video from Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, who testified that Trump had personally called her about helping to further the scheme. The committee also showed texts from an aide to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, indicating that Johnson sought to hand-deliver fake electors from his state and from Michigan.
The revelation came during the panel’s fourth hearing this month, which focused on the pressure applied to election officials and workers to overturn the 2020 results. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, testified that Trump’s allies broke into his widowed daughter-in-law’s house and that his wife received threats.
More so than in the prior hearings, leaders of the special committee also sought today to emphasize that Trump’s false claims of election fraud were a significant threat to the nation’s election system and to democracy itself.

2. Asia is buying up Russia’s discounted oil, dulling the effects of sanctions from the West.
Most of the additional oil has gone to two countries: China and India. China’s imports of Russian oil hit a record high in May and made Russia the country’s largest supplier. India has gone from taking in almost no Russian oil to more than 760,000 barrels a day.
The shift has allowed Moscow to maintain its production levels, helped make the ruble the world’s best-performing currency and underscored the cooperation Russia enjoys from China. Soaring energy prices have led to an uptick in oil revenue for Russia, which took in $1.7 billion more last month than in April.

But the response was notably muted from parents, with little of the excitement and long lines that greeted earlier vaccine campaigns. An April poll showed that less than 20 percent of parents of young children were eager to find shots right away.

4. The Supreme Court ruled that Maine could not exclude religious schools from a state tuition program.
The case arose from an arrangement in Maine that requires rural communities without public secondary schools to provide for students’ educations. One option is to pay tuition at a private school that is “nonsectarian.” Two families that send or wanted to send their children to religious schools challenged the law, saying it violated their right to exercise their faith freely.
“A state need not subsidize private education,” the chief justice wrote in the decision, the latest in a series of rulings forbidding the exclusion of religious institutions from government programs. “But once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.”

Steven McCraw, the director of the Department of Public Safety, testified today before a legislative hearing in Austin on the law enforcement response to the mass shooting, calling it “an abject failure” that ran counter to two decades of training.
He said that the police at the scene had enough firepower and protective equipment to storm the pair of connected classrooms just minutes after shooting began. But the on-scene commander “decided to put the lives of officers ahead of the lives of children” and waited unnecessarily for a key for a door that could not be locked from the inside.

6. Voters decided on runoffs in Alabama and Georgia, and Virginia hosted primaries.
Republican voters in Alabama are experiencing whiplash: Donald Trump, popular in the state, first endorsed Representative Mo Brooks as the party’s nominee for an open Senate seat. But when Brooks lagged in the polls, Trump threw his support to Katie Britt, a former chief of staff for Senator Richard Shelby, who is retiring. Polls indicate a Britt win is likely.
In Georgia, Republicans choose their House contenders against entrenched Democrats. There are similar stakes in Virginia, where Jen Kiggans and Jarome Bell are vying to take on Representative Elaine Luria, a Democrat. All three are Navy veterans in a district where one in five voters are veterans or are on active duty in the military. But what separates them is ideology, with Bell campaigning on Trump’s false claims of election fraud.

10. And finally, a 661-pound stingray may be the world’s largest freshwater fish.

2022-06-22,"A lot of companies have been caught off guard by changes in our spending choices this year. Americans eager to travel and party after two years of staying largely at home are gorging on plane tickets and fancier clothes — and ignoring the patio furniture and soft pants that we splurged on in 2020.
Consumer electronics may be the flaming center of Americans’ flip-flopping shopping habits. Gadget buying has suddenly switched from hot to not, a change that will most likely bring pain and confusion for many companies — and potentially some great deals for people who still want to buy electronics.
In the early months of the pandemic, many of us were so eager to buy internet routers, laptops, video game consoles and other tech gear to keep us productive and cozy from home that some products were impossible to find. However, experts cautioned that people would inevitably pull back on buying some types of gadgets until they needed them again.
The magnitude of change after two flush years of gadget purchases has surprised many people. From January through May, electronics and appliance stores make up the only retail category for which sales fell compared with the same five months of 2021, the Commerce Department disclosed last week. Best Buy said last month that purchases at its stores dropped across the board, especially for computers and home entertainment, and are likely to stay meh. And the research firm IDC expects global smartphone sales to decline this year, most sharply in China.

What’s bad for electronics manufacturers and stores could be good for us, but value hunters will need to be careful. Nathan Burrow, who writes about shopping deals for Wirecutter, the product recommendation service from The New York Times, told me that prices for some electronics are already being discounted. But a sale when inflation is at a 40-year high in the U.S. may not always be a good deal. A discounted product might still cost more than similar models a few years ago, Burrow said.
The whipsaw in shopping habits has led Walmart, Target, Gap and some other retail chains to be stuck with too much of the wrong kinds of products. That’s true about some types of electronics, too, which means that more price chopping is likely during summer shopping “holidays” from Amazon, Target, Best Buy and Walmart.
Burrow predicts significant price breaks are coming for tablets, internet networking equipment, Amazon devices and some laptops including Chromebooks.
The research firm NPD Group said this year that consumer electronic sales would most likely decline in 2022 and again in 2023 and 2024 — but two previous bonkers years of electronics sales would still leave overall sales higher than they were in 2019. Despite the overall higher sales, this phenomenon of electronics sales unexpectedly going through the roof and then suddenly sinking is disorienting for gadget makers and sellers.
“It’s the unpredictability that makes everything worse,” said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at IDC.

Making long-term predictions is tough for manufacturers, retailers and buyers of electronics. Some executives have said that global shipping and the availability of essential components like computer chips may never be 2019 normal. Select electronics like super-low-priced TVs and laptops could be gone for good as manufacturers and retailers became hooked on higher profits from pricier products.
In the electronics industry, experts told me that there were conversations about how to do things differently to prepare for potential future crises, including by spreading more gadget manufacturing to countries other than China. It’s not clear how our spending may shift again in response to inflation, the government’s efforts to cool off climbing prices or a potential recession.
For a while, people in rich countries grew accustomed to a steady stream of cheap and abundant electronics, furniture, clothes and other goods thanks to interconnected global factories and shipping. The pandemic and the wackiness it set off in supply chains have made some economists and executives rethink the status quo.
It’s possible that the ups-and-downs of electronics sales since 2020 will sort themselves out in a couple of years. Or perhaps consumer electronics are a microcosm of a world changed by the pandemic that may never quite be the same again.

Netflix’s next move
Reed Hastings, Netflix’s co-founder, once dismissed the idea of putting ads on the streaming service as a nonstarter. Then, this year, the company posted its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, causing its stock to nosedive. Now, the company is talking to Comcast and Google to help it with the details of a plan to bring an ad-supported offering to its service, The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday.
Ben Mullin, a media reporter for The Times, says the advertising plan could create significant upside for Netflix, even if it raises questions in Hollywood. Here are his thoughts:
Ads could funnel more than $1 billion of high-margin revenue to the streaming service annually, according to some analyst reports. And it could do that in a relatively short time frame: Netflix executives have told employees that they plan to start advertising on the service sometime in the final three months of this year. That’s crucial at a time when Wall Street is putting additional pressure on video-streaming businesses to increase profitability after tolerating years of profligate spending.
Nonetheless, Hollywood execs have questions about an ad-supported Netflix offering: Will content producers get a cut of the revenue that Netflix generates by selling ads against their movies and TV shows? Will directors with final cut privileges get a chance to negotiate with Netflix over which commercials are inserted, and when? And will advertisers get a detailed readout of viewer behavior from Netflix, which has been accused of being stingy with user data? Do Netflix’s existing licensing deals with producers even allow the streamer to show commercials alongside their content?
Ed Lee, another media watcher at The Times, says Netflix is making the move out of necessity, not opportunity.
The real reason Netflix is in a hurry to get its ad-based service up and running: Growth has slowed. And the streamer doesn’t have the technology, the sales staff or the Rolodex to cut any deals. So it can’t do it on its own.
Netflix could end up cannibalizing a big chunk of its current customer base. Earlier this month, analysts at Wells Fargo predicted that a cheaper, ad-supported Netflix offering would attract just over 100 million subscribers by the end of 2025. But only 16 million of those customers would be new users — the Wells Fargo analysts believe nearly 85 percent of the users of Netflix’s cheaper service will be existing subscribers looking to pay less for streaming.
In the end, Hollywood might balk. It’s hard to imagine Martin Scorsese is happy to hear his films could be fronted by an ad for … anything. And, as Ben says, Hollywood execs are already asking questions about what’s in it for them. Netflix could have to renegotiate some of its licensing agreements. For new deals, producers would either want a cut of ad revenue or just more money up front.
For now, Netflix isn’t saying much about its plans. A Netflix spokeswoman said yesterday: “We are still in the early days of deciding how to launch a lower-priced, ad-supported option, and no decisions have been made. So this is all just speculation at this point.”
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Jay Powell, the Fed chair, says a recession is “certainly a possibility.” Powell said the Fed might be able to slow inflation without tipping America into a painful downturn. But successfully executing a so-called soft landing “has been made significantly more challenging by the events of the past few months,” he said, citing supply disruptions that have pushed prices higher. He will appear before the House Financial Services Committee today.
Support for a bipartisan gun reform measure in the Senate reflects a political shift. Fourteen Republicans — including Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader — broke with their party to advance the legislation. Only two are up for re-election this year, and most Republicans are expected to oppose the bill.
Russia is ramping up hacking attacks on Ukraine’s allies, Microsoft researchers say.

Altria paid nearly $13 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul in 2018, and the Marlboro maker had already written down its investment in Juul by at least $11 billion. Yesterday’s news could render that stake worthless or close to it — and leave a huge question mark on the tobacco giant’s future.

E-cigarettes were once the next big thing. Big Tobacco, facing slowing sales of traditional cigarettes, jumped right in. R.J. Reynolds introduced Vuse. The e-cigarette start-up Njoy got backing from high-profile investors like Sean Parker, of Napster and Facebook fame, and the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.

But as Juul’s sales skyrocketed, especially among teens, the F.D.A. became concerned. That led to a 2018 regulatory crackdown. That’s when Juul turned to Altria for funding, as well as some regulatory muscle, instead of trying to fund-raise $20 billion from venture capital firms. In 2020, the agency mandated e-cigarette makers get approval to stay on the U.S. market, which it now appears Juul will not get. An appeal is probable. Juul conducts a majority of its business in the U.S. and reportedly had a net loss last year of $259 million.
This could leave Altria in a world of trouble. Its core product is under fire, with the F.D.A. looking to significantly reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes. Altria gets about 90 percent of its revenue from smokable products. Its revenue fell slightly last year, according to regulatory filings, and its stock is down more than 45 percent in the past five years. Other attempts to diversify, like an investment in the cannabis company Cronos, have similarly faltered: Altria wrote down that investment by $200 million at the end of last year. Might Altria look to make a big play outside cigarettes — say food or snacking, given its huge distribution in convenience stores? Pass the popcorn.

The N.F.L. and toxic workplaces
Professional football teams are not your typical everyday employers. But their visibility means they should be setting an example for how to handle issues like bullying, harassment and intimidation, says Representative Carolyn Maloney, the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Instead, some have fallen far short of that.
At a hearing yesterday, Maloney said the N.F.L. secretly agreed to withhold evidence that Dan Snyder, the owner of the Washington Commanders, had fostered a “notoriously toxic workplace.” Maloney, Democrat of New York, said the league’s failures had compelled her to introduce two new bills intended to protect all workers: “What happens in the N.F.L. has consequences for the rest of the country.” (A representative for Snyder said the committee’s investigation was “predetermined from the beginning,” adding that the team addressed workplace issues “years ago.”)
The proposals would limit nondisclosure agreements and protect worker privacy. The committee began investigating the N.F.L.’s handling of misconduct claims and subsequent investigations in the fall. It found that Snyder relied on bullying and intimidation and treated men and women unequally. The Commanders, for example, fired a female cheerleader who had a consensual sexual relationship with a player, who kept his job. Footage of cheerleaders was also said to have been turned into a personal video for Snyder, an accusation he and others deny. One of the bills introduced by Maloney outlines processes for handling misconduct claims and bans settlements that prevent transparency. The other requires consent to capture employee images and prohibits illegitimate uses.

Will the bills pass? Republicans acknowledge that bullying is a serious problem, but they say that private companies are not under the committee’s jurisdiction, and that Congress should focus on inflation and the economy. The top Republican on the committee, Representative James Comer of Kentucky, protested that an “overhaul” at the Commanders had already begun. The likelihood of passage may be slim, given the vociferous resistance.
Workplace toxicity can also be an economic issue. A McKinsey report on employee mental health across 15 countries says companies “pay a high price for failure to address workplace factors that strongly correlate with burnout, such as toxic behavior.” Toxicity was the biggest predictor of attrition, researchers found. Dissatisfaction with bad management has helped drive the “Great Resignation,” with corporate culture ranked more than 10 times as important to workers than compensation, based on an analysis of Glassdoor reviews by other researchers. Companies are increasingly offering programs for worker wellness while leaving fundamental problems unaddressed, McKinsey researchers wrote: “As an employer, you can’t ‘yoga’ your way out of these challenges.”

2022-06-24,"Companies had more than a month to formulate a response to the end of federal abortion rights in the United States, if they didn’t weigh in immediately after a draft opinion was leaked in May.
But when the final decision arrived in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization on Friday, relatively few had anything to say about the outcome.
Most stayed silent, including some companies that are known for speaking out on social issues such as Black Lives Matter and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Some of the corporations that blacked out their Instagram pages in 2020 or featured rainbow flags on their websites for Pride Month have so far been hesitant to comment on abortion.
“Executives are feeling some trepidation around this,” said Dave Fleet, the head of global digital crisis at Edelman, a consulting firm. “They’re concerned about backlash because they know there’s no way to please everyone.”

Many of the businesses that did make public statements on Friday opted to address the way the Supreme Court’s decision would affect their workers’ access to health care. In some cases they avoided the word “abortion” altogether, perhaps aiming for a more palatable response.
“We have processes in place so that an employee who may be unable to access care in one location has affordable coverage for receiving similar levels of care in another location,” Disney executives wrote in a memo to staff, adding that this included “family planning (including pregnancy-related decisions).”

Other companies that came forward Friday to say they would cover employee travel expenses for abortions include Warner Bros., Condé Nast, BuzzFeed, Vox Media, Goldman Sachs, Snap, Macy’s, Intuit and Dick’s Sporting Goods. They joined a group including Starbucks, Tesla, Yelp, Airbnb, Netflix, Patagonia, DoorDash, JPMorgan Chase, Levi Strauss & Co., PayPal, OKCupid, Citigroup, Kroger, Google, Microsoft, Paramount, Nike, Chobani, Lyft and Reddit that had previously put in effect similar policies. (Google also told employees that they could “apply for relocation without justification.”)
“The employer is the way a lot of people access the health care system,” Mr. Fleet added. “You’re seeing companies look inwardly first.”

A few companies accompanied those policy changes with statements. Roger Lynch, the head of Condé Nast, called the decision “a crushing blow to reproductive rights.” Lyft said the ruling “will hurt millions of women.” BuzzFeed’s chief executive, Jonah Peretti, called it “regressive and horrific.” Some business leaders spoke out too, with Bill Gates, the co-founder and former head of Microsoft, calling the ruling “an unjust and unacceptable setback,” and Sheryl Sandberg, the departing chief operating officer of Meta, writing that it “threatens to undo the progress women have made in the workplace.”
But many companies that have spoken out on social issues like racism did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment after the Supreme Court’s decision, including Target, Walmart, Coca-Cola, Delta and Wendy’s. Hobby Lobby, which in 2014 brought a successful suit to the Supreme Court challenging whether employer-provided health care had to include contraception, declined to comment on the Dobbs decision.
In recent years there has been a growing expectation that companies weigh in on political and social issues. The share of online American adults who believe that companies have a responsibility to participate in debates about current issues has risen in the past year, according to the consumer research company Forrester. The expectation is even more pronounced among younger social media users, according to research from Sprout Social.
When George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020, public companies and their foundations committed over $49 billion to fighting racial inequality. Last year, after Georgia’s Republican-led legislature restricted voter access, some chief executives, including from Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, criticized the law, and 72 Black business leaders published a letter urging corporate leaders to “publicly oppose any discriminatory legislation.”
With abortion, public opinion is a little different: Forrester found that fewer respondents believed companies should take a stance on abortion. Polls have consistently found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, but a recent survey by Pew Research Center found that people have wide-ranging views about morality on the issue. Companies fear the backlash that could come from taking a stance on the issue.

“When it comes to the range of politicized issues within the sphere of a brand’s impact, few are as divisive and deeply personal as abortion” said Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director at Forrester.

Political engagement is rarely a straightforward choice for company leaders. Disney, which had long avoided partisan politics, faced internal backlash this year when it didn’t take a strong stance on Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law, but then Florida lawmakers revoked its special tax benefits when it did. John Gibson, the chief executive of the gaming company Tripwire Interactive, was swiftly replaced after speaking out in favor of Texas’ ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy.
A 2020 study of 149 firms published in the Journal of Marketing found that corporate activism had a negative effect on a company’s stock market performance, though it found a positive effect on sales if the activism was consistent with the values of the company’s consumers.
Both engaging and deciding not to engage can come at a price.
“You’ve got to be careful not to take the wrong lessons from some of those moments,” said Mr. Fleet, of Edelman. “It would be very easy to look at companies that made missteps and say ‘well, we shouldn’t say anything,’ whereas in fact some clients not saying anything is the mistake that was made.”

Some companies warned staff on Friday to be careful how they discuss the ruling in the workplace. “There will be an intense amount of public debate over this decision,” Citigroup’s head of human resources wrote to staff. “Please remember that we must always treat each other respectfully, even when our opinions differ.”
Meta said publicly on Friday that it would reimburse employees for travel expenses to get abortions. But the company then told its workers not to openly discuss the court’s ruling on wide-reaching communication channels inside the company, according to three employees, citing a policy that put “strong guardrails around social, political and sensitive conversations” in the workplace.
But there are other companies that haven’t shied away from more full-throated statements on abortion, and they are urging other businesses to match their tone and commitment.
OkCupid sent a notification to app users in states with abortion restrictions encouraging them to contact their elected officials in support of abortion. Melissa Hobley, its global chief marketing officer, has been working behind the scenes to get other women business leaders to make commitments to support abortion.
“We had to say screw the risk,” she said. “This is an economic problem, this is a marketing problem. If you’re in highly visible, highly competitive industries like tech, law, finance, you are all fighting after female talent.”

Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, said he felt that it was important to speak out about abortion access whether or not there was a business case for doing so, though he knew that there would be users who opposed that decision.
“Certainly when you speak out on these issues not everyone is going to agree,” he said. “As we looked at this, we felt quite strongly that it was the right thing to do,” adding, “it’s been 50 years of settled law.”

Some business leaders said they were concerned about how abortion restrictions will affect their ability to recruit workers, especially those whose companies are based in the 13 states that will ban abortion immediately or very quickly with Roe overturned. Those states include Texas, where tech companies have flocked in recent years.
Research commissioned by the Tara Health Foundation found that two-thirds of college-educated workers surveyed would be discouraged from taking a job in Texas because of its restrictive abortion law and would not apply for jobs in other states that passed similar laws.

“Employers like us may be the last line of defense,” said Sarah Jackel, chief operating officer of Civitech, a 55-person company based in Texas that builds technology tools for political campaigns. The company committed to covering travel expenses for employees in need of an abortion immediately after the passage of Texas’ ban, S.B. 8.
Ms. Jackel said the policy had strong support from both employees and investors, though the company declined to share if anyone had used it.
“It makes good business sense,” she added. “There’s no reason we should be putting our employees in the position of having to choose between keeping their job or carrying out an unwanted pregnancy.”

2022-06-27,"Even as more companies have become outspoken on social causes, the reaction by corporate America on Friday after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade was relatively muted.
In response to the court’s ruling, which ended federal abortion rights, several companies released statements reaffirming their commitment to helping employees access health care services they may not be able to obtain in their state.
Companies in May had begun creating policies on covering travel expenses for employees who need abortions, after a leaked memo from Supreme Court justices previewed their decision on the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The group included Starbucks, Tesla, Yelp, Airbnb, Microsoft, Netflix, Patagonia, DoorDash, JPMorgan Chase, Levi Strauss & Co., PayPal and Reddit. Others, including Disney, Meta, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Condé Nast, joined them on Friday when the decision became final. Most have avoided making public statements directly referencing the ruling.
With abortion rights now overturned on the federal level, there is more pressure for companies to respond, especially for those with headquarters in one of the 13 states that have measures in place to ban abortion immediately or very quickly.
Here’s a sampling of what companies have said in response to the Supreme Court decision:

Johnson & Johnson: “As the world’s most broadly based health care company, we strive to improve access and affordability, create healthier communities, and put health within reach for the people we serve.” It added, “We also believe health care decisions are best determined by individuals in consultation with their health care provider.”
JPMorgan Chase: The country’s largest bank said it was focused on equal access to health care for all its employees. A spokeswoman highlighted a June 1 memo alerting employees that their travel costs would be covered if they needed to go more than 50 miles to receive certain medical procedures, including abortions.
Levi Strauss & Co.: “Protection of reproductive rights is a critical business issue impacting our work force, our economy and progress toward gender and racial equity,” the company said. “Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard.”
Reddit: The company said its employees could get a stipend to cover travel for procedures such as abortions. “Our benefits programs are designed to support the health and safety of our employees, and we also have robust policies to support women in the workplace,” a representative said.

A package of Plan B.

The men profiting from demand for Plan B
Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, many women have been rushing to stock up on emergency contraception pills, in hopes of exerting more control over their bodies, or because they’re worried that the products could be restricted. (Birth control remains legal across the United States.) Drugstores have found themselves in short supply of the pills, and some are limiting purchases.
The uptick in demand could add up to huge profits for the two private equity firms behind the most well-known morning-after pill, Plan B. It might also put Plan B in the middle of the abortion rights fight.
The all-male teams of investors behind Plan B are poised to make big bucks. According to the websites of the two private equity firms, Kelso and Juggernaut, only men make up the teams overseeing the maker of the top-selling emergency contraception in the United States. And their paydays could be big. One dose of brand-name Plan B typically sells for around $46. And it’s probably quite profitable: It had a more than 85 percent profit margin when it was sold as a prescription drug by Barr, said David Woodburn, a former analyst who covered the company. (Neither firm responded to DealBook’s requests for comment about the gender makeup of their teams.)
Plan B’s maker had exclusive marketing rights for three years after the F.D.A. extended the medication’s over-the-counter use to all ages in 2013. That exclusivity plays a big role in how well-known the brand is. The brand has competition from cheaper generic versions, but women often prefer familiar brands of health products like emergency contraception, analysts say. Teva, which acquired Barr, sold Plan B to Kelso and Juggernaut in 2017 for $675 million. The firms run Plan B through Foundation Consumer Healthcare, a company that owns several over-the-counter brands, including the cold medicine Dimetapp.
The language on the emergency pill’s packaging could pave the way for its restriction. Plan B works mainly by stopping the release of an egg from the ovaries. But some believe that its maker had to use certain wording to get it approved by the F.D.A. in 2006 for over-the-counter use. As such, Plan B’s label says it may also prevent a fertilized embryo from attaching to the uterus. That distinction matters, because some states argue that a fertilized embryo is a person, which could create grounds for banning Plan B.  To prevent that, Foundation Consumer and its owners could ask the F.D.A. for an updated label, but that could put the firms in the middle of political cross hairs they would probably rather avoid.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Ernst & Young is fined $100 million over exam cheating. The S.E.C. handed out its largest fine against an auditing firm after finding that some auditors had cheated on ethics exams. “It’s simply outrageous that the very professionals responsible for catching cheating by clients cheated on ethics exams,” said Gurbir Grewal, the commission’s director of enforcement.
The Group of 7 leaders agree to seek price caps on Russian oil. As Russia’s revenue from oil remains high, officials from the G7 agreed to the temporary move as a way to slow down President Vladimir Putin’s war machine. The group will also pledge to spend $4.5 billion this year to counter global food shortages caused by the invasion of Ukraine.
At least 46 migrants are found dead in San Antonio in and around an abandoned tractor-trailer. It appeared to be one of the worst episodes of migrant death in the U.S. in recent years. Officials suggested extreme heat had contributed to the deaths of the migrants, who are believed to have crossed into the country from Mexico.
China eases its quarantine rules for international arrivals. China’s economy has endured months of uncertainty because of the country’s strict Covid rules, but the Shanghai stock market jumped on the news that the mandated time in a quarantine facility will drop to a week, half the current requirement.

Checking the receipts
Several companies have pledged to help employees travel across state lines for abortions since it first became apparent that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade. But many of those firms have also donated to political campaigns that actively worked to undercut Roe. The journalist Dan Rather asked which supportive companies “also gave money to senators who voted to confirm the justices who gutted this constitutional right?”
DealBook checked the records, and at least 11 companies that are offering to cover employees’ abortion-related travel expenses — Citigroup, Disney, Goldman Sachs, Google, Intuit, JPMorgan Chase, Meta/Facebook, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce, and Yelp — also gave to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helped elect some of the lawmakers who confirmed the conservative justices appointed by President Donald Trump. Their contributions via company political action committees, which gather employee donations, totaled about $440,000 from 2017 to the present, filings with the Federal Election Commission show.

The companies respond: A Yelp spokeswoman noted that the company gives to both Democrats and Republicans. An Intuit spokesman said its PAC was nonpartisan. A PayPal spokeswoman said its PAC had not made a political contribution since 2020. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. Google, Facebook and Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and Salesforce did not comment in time for publication.
Companies are big political spenders. “Leading public companies and their trade associations have been the dominant donors to the Republican Attorneys General Association and the Republican State Leadership Committee and, to a slightly lesser degree, to the Republican Governors Association,” said Bruce Freed of the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit group. Members of those Republican groups have worked to restrict abortion rights. The dating site company Match Group established a fund to cover costs associated with severe abortion restrictions in Texas last year, but as Popular Information reported, the company also gave $137,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association, arguably undermining the rights of the women it now promises to support.

Pointing an arrow at Robinhood?
Last month, the crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried bought nearly 8 percent of Robinhood, the app-based brokerage firm. Now, he’s reportedly considering an offer for the whole shebang.
Bloomberg reported yesterday that FTX — which has been on a mini-acquisition spree as crypto prices have crashed — has held internal discussions on whether it makes sense to buy Robinhood. Shares of the once-hot brokerage firm rose 14 percent on the news, but are still down 80 percent from their I.P.O. price. At the current market cap, FTX could buy the rest of Robinhood for just $7 billion.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Bankman-Fried said yesterday that “there are no active M&A conversations with Robinhood.” But in a statement later in the day to DealBook and others, he said he was “excited about Robinhood’s prospects,” and thought the two firms could work together. That leaves the door open to a deal, and raises some questions.
How would a deal get done? Investors valued FTX, headquartered in the Bahamas, at $32 billion earlier this year. But does FTX really want to be within reach of U.S. regulators? It has a sister company, FTX.US, based in San Francisco, that has a much lower valuation. On his own, Bankman-Fried is worth around $20 billion, according to Forbes. How much of that is he willing to risk on Robinhood?
Would FTX change Robinhood’s commission-free business model? Much of Robinhood’s revenue comes from payment for order flow, a contentious Wall Street trading practice that the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to at least partly eliminate. Last month, FTX started a trial of its own commission-free stock brokerage firm, and has vowed not to do any deals involving payment for order flow. Perhaps FTX’s crypto trading business is profitable enough that it can use Robinhood’s stock trades as a loss leader?
What would happen if Robinhood’s meme-stock-heavy trading business mixed with FTX’s crypto volatility? “It’s a recipe for problems,” said Paul Rowady, director of research at the brokerage technology consulting firm Alphacution. He said allowing FTX customers to fund their Robinhood accounts to buy GameStop and similar stocks would be layering volatility on top of volatility. “My thought bubble for SBF would be, ‘Don’t do it,’” Rowady said, referring to Bankman-Fried.
“It’s a doomsday scenario if individuals have to bring their health care choices to their employers.”

New York’s wealth exodus
The hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who left the city during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic drained it of $21 billion in taxable income, according to IRS filings received in 2020 and 2021.
New York City relies heavily on its wealthiest residents to support schools, law enforcement and other public services. The outflow of about 300,000 residents was the biggest in the city’s records, The Times’s Nicole Hong and Matthew Haag report, and it will have long-term effects.
The top 1 percent of the city’s earners, who make more than $804,000 a year, contributed 41 percent of New York City’s personal income taxes in 2019.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The city’s outlook could be grim. It collected more tax revenue in both 2020 and 2021 than it did in 2019, thanks in part to at least $16 billion in federal pandemic aid. But many forms of stimulus have now ended. And the loss of in-person workers has caused the market value of office buildings to plunge during the pandemic, prompting a sharp decline in property tax revenue.
New Yorkers’ exodus to Florida was especially stark. The pandemic accelerated the relocation of several New York-based financial firms to new offices or headquarters in Florida, including the hedge fund Elliott Management. The firm’s co-chief executive, Jonathan Pollock, is now a full-time Florida resident, according to records obtained by The Times.

2022-07-01,"Technoblade, a YouTube personality who built a following of millions with his wry commentary on videos of himself playing Minecraft, has died, his father announced in a video posted on his son’s account.
More than 11 million subscribers made a habit of watching screen recordings of Technoblade’s Minecraft gameplay as he provided commentary off camera. While he usually focused on what was happening in the game, in some videos he described life events as mundane as going to the D.M.V. or as devastating as receiving a cancer diagnosis.
A video titled “so long nerds,” which was posted on Technoblade’s YouTube channel on Thursday and has been viewed more than 26 million times as of Friday afternoon, departed from the channel’s usual aesthetic of colorful, pixelated bricks. Instead, a man who identifies himself as Technoblade’s father appears, sitting in a chair against a stark white background with a small white dog in his lap.
His father, who does not give his name, reads a message from his son that begins: “Hello, everyone. Technoblade here. If you are watching this, I am dead.”
The message goes on to reveal Technoblade’s first name, Alex, which he did not use online. The video also features a handful of photos of Alex with loved ones. He had rarely shown himself in his YouTube videos, preferring instead to present himself as his avatar: a crowned, sword-wielding pig.
“If I had another hundred lives, I think I would choose to be Technoblade again every single time,” Alex’s letter says. “Those were the happiest years of my life.”
His father, who remains emotional throughout the video, says he and his son talked for months about whether to record a final video. Instead, Alex decided to write the letter and died about eight hours after finishing it, his father says.
“I don’t think he said everything he wanted to say, but I think he got the main points,” he says.
The video ends with a written statement attributed to Alex’s mother, who is not named. She wrote that her son avoided personal fame and was self-deprecating, even as his channel skyrocketed in popularity.

“From Technoblade’s earliest online days, he was always strategizing ways to delight and reward his audience, giving away online prizes, encouraging good sportsmanship and, most of all, sharing his Minecraft adventures for entertainment and laughs,” she wrote.
Alex’s family could not be reached on Friday. Hypixel, a gaming company that worked with Technoblade, said the family had asked that requests for comment not be forwarded to them. “The video they shared contains all information they are comfortable sharing at this time,” Don Pireso, the company’s lead administrator, said in a Twitter direct message.
Alex first publicly acknowledged his cancer diagnosis in a video posted on his channel in August. Like the others, the video showed the game while he spoke off camera. He retained his self-deprecating, humorous style, refusing to get too earnest. He also revealed his age at the time, 22.
In the video, he described how the first round of chemotherapy left him so exhausted that he could barely sit up for a virtual doctor’s appointment. Then, he joked: “Sitting in a chair, am I Superman?”
He said he was diagnosed after experiencing serious pain in his arm. He initially dismissed it as a repetitive stress injury from playing video games, but even after a few days of rest, he said, his shoulder “was swelling like crazy.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
He also implored people to get a Covid-19 vaccine, saying that the cancer treatments had weakened his immune system, putting him at greater risk of serious illness from the coronavirus.
“I’m going to go ahead and speak on behalf of all cancer patients when I say it is incredibly annoying when the hospitals are getting overworked by people dying of preventable diseases,” he said in the video. “I’m just saying, we’ve got dibs on those hospital beds.”
On social media, Technoblade’s friends and fans praised him for his humor and for being a role model among Minecraft players.
Minecraft is unlike most games because its owner, Microsoft, does not control the servers where players meet online. Players can instead create their own servers or join one made by someone else, creating a sprawling network of worlds in the Minecraft universe.
Hypixel, which runs a network of Minecraft servers, said it had created a digital memorial book for people to write messages that would be printed and sent to Technoblade’s family. The company’s tribute featured an illustration of Technoblade’s pig avatar as a statue. “In many ways, the success of many of us is tied to the success of Technoblade,” the company said.

One of Technoblade’s friends, the YouTuber Thomas Simons, better known as TommyInnit, described him on Twitter as a “legend.”
“I just know,” Mr. Simons wrote, “he’s strategizing in heaven on how to beat God.”

Re “America the Merciless,” by Pamela Paul (column, June 27):
Ms. Paul asks how we could have become such a cruel and merciless country when the majority of us favor compassion and mercy. The answer is that this country isn’t set up on the basis of majority rule.
We have small rural states with two senators that together have more voting power than large urban states, also with two senators. We have an Electoral College system that favors small rural states. We have a Republican Party that has become more and more authoritarian, violent and vindictive. We have a Democratic Party that is chronically unable to stand up to bullies.
I share Ms. Paul’s hope that the good we have will overcome the evil in us.

To the Editor:
Essays like this one from Pamela Paul are decidedly unhelpful in describing our country, since for every instance she cites there are many others that demonstrate our neighborliness and generosity. For example, the same country of unmatched gun violence is unmatched in charitable donations.
America is not merciless; America has problems like every other country. This compulsion to indict its character is too common among the left and may be acceptable in the academy, but it grates outside the ivy walls.

Pamela Paul’s question “How do we celebrate on the Fourth of July a country whose laws and institutions so often fail to bring out the best in us?” prompts me to decide, sadly and after several years evading the issue, to withhold displaying the colors this coming Fourth — a Colin Kaepernick variant, so to speak."

Re “Strangers Are Good for Us,” by David Sax (Opinion guest essay, June 17):
As a faculty member at a university pharmacy department, I developed an elective in geriatric pharmacy, the object of which was to understand the geriatric patient.
Part of the course required the student to approach any very elderly stranger and start a conversation. Some were reluctant to do this.
The results were enlightening: Students helped with crossing the road and carried packages, and one student took a lonely elderly person for coffee.
All reported a sense of having done a worthwhile mission, having brought a bright ray into the lives of a complete stranger.

Bravo to David Sax for saying what needs to be said, that technology in the name of bringing us together actually drives us further apart.
How often do you see two people at some coffee shop table, crouching over their device instead of talking to each other? Those things are social poison!

While David Sax argues that technological evolution and the pandemic have kept us from deep human interaction, modern life has sparked a hunger for community.
From Covid-19 to uprisings over police brutality, an international conflict and the fight for reproductive justice, the world has been through a transformative experience. Still, without denying the great suffering that has happened, it is during times like these that strangers have come together in a spirit of solidarity to support fellow citizens, defend basic rights and connect with the natural world.

The past few years have powerfully revealed just how vulnerable and dependent we are on each other. It remains to be seen whether the solidarity we have collectively created will endure. But as Mr. Sax argues, we should experience the subtle ways a stranger’s smile, question or palpable stare can nurture a valuable sense of connection.

Reading David Sax’s article reminded me of an experience I had in the summer of 1987 when I had just graduated from high school in Manhattan. I was working a grueling data-entry job that offered a one-hour respite in the middle of the workday for lunch.

My best friend had lent me his Walkman, a newfangled contraption that allowed one to listen to music privately through headphones. During my lunch hour I would go to a nearby park and sit on a bench, enjoying myself, numbing out to the songs of my favorite pop stars.
One day a woman approached me while I was zoned out on the park bench, and began to speak to me. I took my earphones off so I could hear what she was saying, and discovered that she was essentially chewing me out for wearing headphones in public.
I defended myself: “It doesn’t hurt you!”
To my surprise, she answered: “But it does hurt me!”
I was at a total loss for words. Feeling irritated at this unwelcome disruption to my lunch break, I put my headphones back on and stared at my feet until she went away.

Re “The U.S. Is Losing Its Military Edge in Asia, and China Knows It,” by Ashley Townshend and James Crabtree (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, June 15):
I agree with the authors’ call for increased resources to the Indo-Pacific, but I disagree with their singular focus on enhancing U.S. military resources in the region. Instead, the United States must focus on increasing diplomatic and development resources to the Indo-Pacific if we want to counter China’s growing aggression effectively.
For the past decade, U.S. foreign assistance to East Asia and the Pacific has hovered around 3 to 5 percent of the global total of U.S. foreign assistance in our base budget. U.S. assistance to the wider Indo-Pacific region has barely broken 10 percent of the global total in the past five years.
An overemphasis on defense resources will continue to allow Beijing to employ political and economic coercion with impunity. Those are the very actions that often stop regional partners from working more closely with the United States on the very deterrence that Mr. Townshend and Mr. Crabtree hope to reinforce.

Re “Is the Thin Blue Line Getting Thinner?,” by Jay Caspian Kang (Opinion, Sunday Review, June 12):
I was a sheriff’s deputy from the 1980s through early 2000s, in Los Angeles and Seattle, and I can tell you there has been a mighty struggle to find qualified recruits. This is not a new problem. I’ve long advocated far better pay and benefits (not only for cops but for all essential services as well) to improve the candidate pool.
But what this profession requires is more a “calling” than a search for a paycheck. Police officers must be guardians, warriors, social advocates and many other personas to be effective. And every time there is a “bad shoot” or any other criminal or negligent behavior by one of us it smears all of us.

Of course disheartened personnel are leaving. Self-defeating slogans such as “defund the police” aren’t helping.
Cops need to be trained in community policing. My fellow deputies and I used it to great effect in some of our most problematic areas. We won the residents over by showing we truly cared about them.
It’s a tough profession. We know that going in. But the real fix lies in creating sincere alliances with the communities. Without that, it’s rinse and repeat, forever.

Re “The Wondrous World That Only Animals See,” by Ed Yong (Opinion guest essay, June 21):
After a year dedicated to promoting biodiversity and planting more native plants on our five-acre property, I remarked to my husband that the big difference between experiencing the typical manicured lawnscape we’re used to and what we have wrought by allowing our land (plants and animals) more self-determination is that instead of a static scene that is the same each morning, I see and hear a slightly different landscape each day.
There are new plants finding a place to grow, a wider variety of birds settling in, and evidence of greater activity behind my back: peach trees and oak seedlings growing where squirrels have planted peach pits from the compost and acorns, a groundhog bringing her new kits out from under the deck for their first outing on clover and grass, a hawk and a fox setting up stakeouts for prey in the early morning.
My 90-year-old husband replied, “Human imaginations are nothing compared to what nature has to offer when you stop trying to control it and learn to live as part of it.”

Re “Microsoft to Delete Facial Analysis Tools From A.I.” (Business, June 22):
Microsoft’s artificial intelligence emotion-recognition tool is being deleted because bias around the age, race, gender or culture of subjects may make it inaccurate or unreliable.

2022-07-06,"When Steve Ballmer retired from Microsoft in 2014, his wife, Connie Snyder, informed him his next job would be to help run the family philanthropy, which fosters upward economic mobility among children from lower-income families.
“My initial reaction to my wife was, ‘That’s the role of the government. We have to pay our taxes, and government does the rest,’” Ballmer recalled in an interview at Yardbird, a fried chicken restaurant near Capitol Hill. “She said, ‘We’re working on this together.’ I said, ‘Fine.’”
The more Ballmer thought about it, the more he realized that not only did government have a large role to play in making Americans more prosperous, he didn’t feel like he had a good understanding of what government as a whole was trying to do with his tax dollars — where it was succeeding and where it was failing. He wondered: What kind of educational outcomes are we seeing? What kind of crime outcomes?
“I wanted to understand where we could make a difference,” said Ballmer, who was known at Microsoft as a voracious consumer of data and information. “I wanted to see the numbers.”

As a business executive, he could study the annual 10-K reports that all publicly traded companies must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to find out what his competitors were up to. But there was nothing analogous for the American government, from the federal level on down. That, he discovered, was partly the result of our uniquely fragmented system, and partly because of sheer disorganization and bureaucratic dysfunction.
Ballmer found this frustrating. So he set out, as he put it, “to create a product I would want to use.”
Nothing but the facts
In 2014, Ballmer created an early version of USAFacts, a website that set out to answer his own questions about the way American government works — and doesn’t work.
Eight years on, USAFacts is a nonprofit group that now produces an annual report on the state of the country, stuffed with slickly produced figures and charts on trends in living standards, firearm-related deaths, inflation’s effect on wage growth, states that are weathering the pandemic the best and much, much more.
Ballmer can rattle off many of the statistics from memory, and he apologizes when he briefly forgets a number. He also enjoys quizzing his audience on the data, at one point asking me: Do you know how many veterans there are in the United States?

When I demurred, he took pride in noting that the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates the number at 20 million, while the Census Bureau will say 18 million — a gap he called “crazy.”

“You have to put the pressure on the agencies,” he said. “They’re very professional, good statistical people. But nobody actually asked the Census Bureau and the Veterans Department to agree on the number of veterans in the country.”
Drawing on his days running the world’s largest software company, Ballmer also published a mock 10-K report for the fiscal year that ended in September 2019 — 250-odd pages detailing the revenues, expenditures and other “key metrics” intended to help Americans form their own conclusions about whether their tax dollars are being spent wisely.

When we spoke, Ballmer had just returned from a whirlwind day of briefings on Capitol Hill, where he met with the House Select Committee on Modernization and the Problem Solvers Caucus, as well as Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, and Representative Kevin McCarthy, the chamber’s top Republican. He also sat down with Denice Ross, the chief data scientist in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
On the Senate side, he briefed around 25 senators — all of them Democrats, despite his best efforts to assemble a bipartisan audience. He held a separate, one-on-one Zoom session with Senator Jon Ossoff, who had come down with a mild case of Covid-19, and came away impressed with the Georgia Democrat’s probing questions about America’s labor shortage, which Ballmer attributes in part to declining birthrates and lower rates of immigration.
The N.B.A. and Congress
Ballmer is fond of quoting James Madison, a founding father and one of the primary architects of the U.S. Constitution. Madison urged the nascent federal government to develop robust systems for collecting and maintaining data on the state of the nation.
In a private letter to a colleague, Madison once wrote: “A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps, both.”
If Ballmer ruled the world, he would require politicians to document their agreement on a common set of facts. That alone, he thinks, would work wonders.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Every elected official should have to read some summary and sign and say, ‘Yes, this is the basis of which I believe.’”
Ballmer’s eyes light up, too, when I bring up the subject of basketball, another of his passions.
He sees many parallels between sports and government, though he balks a little at the link between basketball and Sabermetrics, a data-driven system of evaluating baseball players that was developed by Oakland Athletics manager Billy Beane. The system became the basis of “Moneyball,” the 2003 book and 2011 movie.
But Ballmer is a numbers guy, and one reason he likes to contrast the N.B.A. with Congress is that he believes performance in both cases should be measurable somehow.
“There’s accountability,” he said of the N.B.A. “Every 24 seconds, you get a scorecard. You either scored that basket or you didn’t score that basket.”
He tells the story of how the N.B.A. has hired a software company that placed cameras in every arena in the league. The system watches each game and analyzes things like which defensive plays or tactics work best against which players, categorizes the data and reports back to the coaches on what it has found.

“If only our own government had a similar learning mechanism,” he says, somewhat wistfully, before adding, “There’s no real customer for the data. There’s nobody who says, ‘I’m going to use numbers to make a decision.’”

Republicans for Josh
On Wednesday, the campaign of Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat in a dead heat for governor of Pennsylvania with Doug Mastriano, the Republican candidate, rolled out a preliminary list of G.O.P. endorsements. You read that right: a Pennsylvania Democrat is promoting his Republican backers.
So far, the roster contains just one name that might be familiar to a national audience: Charlie Dent, a former congressman who was a prominent early critic of Donald Trump. Seeking to capitalize on the unease many college-educated Republicans express about Trump and his influence on the 2022 midterms, Democrats are planning to unveil similar groups in other states.
More interesting for students of Pennsylvania political geography are Shapiro’s local endorsements. They include Morgan Boyd, the chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Lawrence County, which is along the Ohio border about halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh.

That’s some unfriendly territory for Democrats. The county — the self-proclaimed “hot dog capital of the world” that is also home to two of the largest fireworks companies, Pyrotecnico and Zambelli Fireworks — went for Trump in the 2020 presidential election by a margin of nearly 30 percentage points.
In an interview, Boyd said he backed Shapiro not for any partisan reason, but because of his policies. Shapiro has proposed expanding broadband and using apprenticeship programs to bring high-tech jobs to rural areas — ideas that have a lot of purchase in struggling small towns like New Castle, the county seat, which has lost about half its population since 1950.
“Everybody has the same issues,” Boyd said, referring to the T-shaped area of Pennsylvania outside of its major cities. “Our young people are leaving for cities like Pittsburgh or Dallas, and we need to reverse that decline.”
Investing in infrastructure is a big part of Shapiro’s pitch to rural communities. Boyd noted that recent storms in Lawrence County had sent sewage backing up into people’s homes and had left the streets of New Castle — which sits in a bowl-shaped valley where two rivers converge — flooded with runoff.
Blowback for endorsing a Democrat “didn’t cross my mind,” said Boyd, who noted that he was “still very much a Republican.”

As for Mastriano, Shapiro’s Republican opponent who has appeared with proponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, Boyd said, “He’s too extreme for me.”

2022-07-08,"SEOUL — In South Korea, one of the world’s most technologically advanced countries, there are few limits to what can be done conveniently online — except if you’re using the wrong web browser.
On Google Chrome, you can’t make business payments online as a corporate customer of one of the country’s largest foreign-owned banks. If you’re using Apple’s Safari, you’re unable to apply for artist funding through the National Culture and Arts website. And if you’re a proprietor of a child care facility, registering your organization with the Health and Welfare Ministry’s website is not possible on Mozilla’s Firefox.
In all these cases, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, or a similar alternative, is the required browser.
When Microsoft shut down Internet Explorer, or IE, on June 15, the company said it would start redirecting users to its newer Edge browser in the coming months. The announcement inspired jokes and memes commemorating the internet of yesteryear. But in South Korea, IE is not some online artifact. The defunct browser is still needed for a small number of critical banking and government-related tasks that many people can’t live without.
South Korea’s fealty to Internet Explorer, 27 years after its introduction and now into its retirement, presents a heavy dose of irony: A country known for blazing broadband and innovative devices is tethered to a buggy and insecure piece of software abandoned by most of the world long ago.
Most South Korean websites work on every browser, including Google Chrome, which takes up about 54 percent of the country’s internet use. Internet Explorer is less than 1 percent, according to Statcounter. Yet after the announcement from Microsoft, there was a last-minute scramble among some essential sites to prepare for life after IE."
2022-07-09,"Driving rain pelted the windows of “the Tower,” a second-story glass enclosure in Ray Gaesser’s home that provides a view for miles of the gentle, rolling fields around Corning, Iowa. Inside, away from the elements, Mr. Gaesser pondered what the coming year might bring for farmers.
As tractors and planters throughout the Midwest rolled into fields like the ones near his house earlier this year, Mr. Gaesser, 69, was hopeful that soaring grain prices and heightened global demand for food would translate into robust revenues. But he also expected that sharply higher costs for fuel, fertilizer and other necessities would cut deeply into profits.
And then there is Big Food.
Companies like PepsiCo, Cargill, Walmart, and General Mills are trying to convince farmers like Mr. Gaesser to adopt new climate-friendly agricultural techniques through a variety of financial incentives and programs. They have good reason. Together, these companies have pledged that at least 70 million acres, or roughly 18 percent of the nation’s total cropland, an area about the size of Nevada, will be operated using regenerative agriculture techniques by 2030.
Through photosynthesis, plants — whether corn or trees — convert carbon dioxide from the air into energy that is stored in the soil. Regenerative farming techniques, such as planting a cover crop during the fall, allows that process to continue throughout the winter months when the soil would normally be bare.
But there are several complicating factors. The programs sponsored by the companies, which run from cost-sharing agreements with farmers to guarantees to cover any declines in yields to complex, multiyear contracts to pay for carbon dioxide that is captured and held in the soil, are largely still in pilot stages and amount to only a fraction of the companies’ overall goals. And many farmers remain skeptical of the initiatives, arguing that the incentives being offered simply aren’t enough to cover the additional costs these new techniques will incur.
“What is it worth to them for us to farm differently?” Mr. Gaesser asked.

2022-07-11,"As a group of conservative states enacted severe abortion restrictions last year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois sent letters to a handful of corporate executives with close ties to Texas.
Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, urged executives to rethink basing their companies in “a state that strips its residents of their dignity.” Most workers, he wrote, did not want to live under a rigid abortion ban.
There was no immediate response to his overture. Companies thriving in Texas’ freewheeling business environment were not about to flee because of legally contested abortion regulations that were not certain to be enforced.
Ten months later, the political and legal landscape is radically different. And a Supreme Court decision that abolished the right to an abortion is now threatening to reshape the lines of economic competition between conservative and liberal states.

For companies anchored in economically vibrant conservative states like Texas, Tennessee and Georgia, the rollback of women’s rights is no longer a hypothetical scenario but an immediate challenge. It represents a potential disruption to the calculus that has made Republican-led Sun Belt states a draw for big companies, which have tended to embrace the reduced taxes and regulations while treating local social policy as something of a sideshow.
That bargain may have grown more difficult in states that have imposed punitive abortion restrictions, banning the procedure altogether or limiting it nearly to the point of elimination.
Some of the country’s biggest businesses, including JPMorgan Chase, AT&T and the Walt Disney Company, have already announced they would take steps to help employees who need abortion access but cannot obtain it in their home states. There have not yet been major announcements about companies canceling expansions or relocating offices out of jurisdictions where abortion is now banned.

In states like Texas and Georgia, Republican lawmakers are effectively wagering that the local business environment will remain appealing enough to overcome concerns about women’s rights. And to some conservative politicians, the risk of alienating business investment is a price worth paying to eradicate abortion.

The fallout of the Supreme Court’s ruling could be more dangerous for states that share Texas’ economic and social policies but lack its longstanding status as an economic powerhouse — states like Arkansas and Oklahoma, which have passed some of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country.
In places where pitched battles over abortion laws are now underway, some business leaders are urging politicians to proceed with caution.
“An extreme response is not in the state’s competitive interest,” said Sandy Baruah, president of the Detroit Regional Chamber, an influential business association in Michigan. “To the extent that the data shows today that young professionals care about this issue, I don’t want to give young professionals a reason not to come to Michigan to work for Michigan companies.”
Mr. Baruah’s group responded to the Supreme Court’s decision with a statement imploring state officials not to do anything that could make Michigan less hospitable for business recruitment. The state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Republican-controlled Legislature are currently clashing over the fate of a nearly century-old abortion ban that had been voided by Roe v. Wade but never formally repealed.
Mr. Baruah acknowledged that some states, like Texas, might be so well established as business havens that they could shrug off concerns about abortion rights and talent recruitment. Of his own state, Mr. Baruah said: “Michigan needs every advantage it can get.”

In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, gave a similar warning on Wednesday as he issued an executive order reinforcing abortion rights in the state. Mr. Cooper, who has vowed to veto any abortion ban approved by the Republican legislature, said any such measure “would have a negative effect on economic growth here in our state.”
Some Republican-controlled states that have already imposed limits on abortions, like Florida and South Carolina, are weighing whether to tighten them even further. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, perhaps the most prominent conservative governor, has enacted a 15-week ban, but some state legislators are pushing for a so-called heartbeat bill that would block all but the earliest abortions.
Gina Raimondo, the nation’s commerce secretary, said in an interview that the states imposing rigid abortion bans were all but certain to suffer economically.

“I’ve spoken to C.E.O.s who are rethinking those states,” said Ms. Raimondo, a Democrat. “I think the cumulative effect will, over time, develop to be quite significant.”

Big companies are fighting a “war for talent,” Ms. Raimondo said, and particularly for female talent given that women make up a growing majority of new college graduates. A former governor of Rhode Island, Ms. Raimondo predicted that companies would find it difficult to recruit skilled workers in states where women’s rights and medical services were sharply curtailed.
There is data to back up that view: A survey published this month by the Pew Research Center found that more than 3 in 5 people with college and postgraduate degrees disapproved of the Supreme Court’s decision, along with nearly 70 percent of people under 30. Sixty-two percent of women disapproved of the decision, according to the survey.
A young and educated cohort of workers has been pushing companies in recent years to be more vocal in speaking out on issues of broad social concern, including gay rights and racial justice, bringing some major corporations into conflict with the conservative-leaning states they call home.
Some liberal states are already depicting their abortion rights policies as a business advantage, reinforcing the appeal of the wealthier and more progressive states that many businesses opt to call home in spite of their taxes.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, suggested that companies should consider his state’s ironclad abortion rights protections as an inducement to expand there. Mr. Pritzker, a billionaire venture capitalist before entering politics, said in a recent interview that his administration was including information about Illinois’s permissive abortion laws in its recruitment pitch to companies, particularly since the court’s draft opinion leaked in a Politico article in early May.

As a political matter, Mr. Pritzker urged Democrats to lean into the message that abortion restrictions were bad for the economy.
“A Democratic president and vice president, Democrats more broadly, should be talking about this first as an issue of individual rights and freedom, and second as an economic issue,” he said. “Workers care about this.”

This is not the first time in recent years when right-wing social policies have thrown state-level business competition into turmoil. In 2016, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina triggered a multiyear business boycott by passing a law — known as the “bathroom bill” — requiring transgender people to use facilities that matched the gender they were assigned at birth. Two years earlier, the business community in Arizona mobilized in force against so-called religious freedom legislation that could have opened the door to discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. people.
In Virginia, a 2012 attempt by far-right legislators to mandate that women receive invasive ultrasounds before obtaining an abortion caused outrage among moderate voters and corporate leaders, helping vault a pro-business Democrat into the governorship the next year. In 2011, the Mississippi business community rallied to defeat a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have granted legal rights to a fertilized egg, defying the Roe v. Wade decision that was then in place.

Yet even amid that drumbeat of controversy, a handful of big, conservative-leaning states like Texas, Florida and Georgia have defied predictions that anti-gay policies or laissez-faire gun laws would deter new investment. Indeed, Republican governors have recently grown more willing to defy big business: When Disney recently expressed disapproval of a Florida law limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, Mr. DeSantis responded with a blistering attack.
Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who served as a top official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, questioned whether the abortion laws would do much to undermine the economic appeal of conservative states.
“These red states with low taxes, low regulation, investments in education and roads — that’s the real contrast with these older blue states that are kind of falling apart,” Mr. Reed said.
There is no recent precedent, however, for a rightward lurch in state-level policy on the scale of the crackdown on abortion that is now underway across much of the United States. The full impact of new restrictions is still uncertain in many states, and some bans are riddled with questions about how they will be enforced. A few, like Oklahoma’s total ban on abortion, appear to be so sweeping that they could imperil other kinds of reproductive care, including certain fertility treatments.

In Texas, the biggest and most prosperous state where abortion is now illegal, business leaders are expressing guarded optimism that the state’s economy can weather any backlash.

Glenn Hamer, president of the Texas Association of Business, said the state’s core appeal to big corporations was still intact.
“The fundamentals of the Texas economy and the Texas work force remain very strong and I would expect continued strong growth well into the future,” said Mr. Hamer, whose organization has not taken a position on the state’s abortion laws.
Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has professed no concern about abortion restrictions deterring business investment. In an email, Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for the governor, boasted of the state’s “unmatched competitive advantages,” including “no corporate or personal income taxes, a predictable regulatory climate and a young, growing and skilled work force.”
Rachel Smith, the president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said the patchwork of state abortion bans would strain big companies with employees in multiple jurisdictions and clashing local laws. Ms. Smith, whose organization represents companies including Amazon and Microsoft, said many recruits viewed medical care — including top-flight reproductive medicine — as a “foundational” concern in choosing their workplace.
“Was it taken for granted in a lot of places? Sure — I’m sure it was,” Ms. Smith said. “Is access to more comprehensive health care now at the top of the list for more people? I’m sure it is. The changes are causing people to be more deliberate.”"

2022-07-13,"Netflix has selected Microsoft to help build its forthcoming ad-supported tier, the streaming giant said on Wednesday.
In April, after announcing in its first-quarter earnings report that it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade, Netflix unexpectedly said it would introduce a less expensive offering with commercials to try to boost subscription numbers. At the time, Reed Hastings, a co-chief executive at Netflix, said the company would seek a third party to help build the new tier. Netflix has never had a dedicated sales and advertising team, and for years had vowed that commercials would never appear on its service.
Since the announcement, Netflix had talked to a number of companies about a potential partnership, including NBCUniversal, Google and the Trade Desk.
Netflix has also told staff that it hopes to introduce the advertising tier by the end of the year. The company will still have its commercial-free tier, which is more expensive for subscribers.

“Microsoft has the proven ability to support all our advertising needs as we work together to build a new ad-supported offering,” Greg Peters, Netflix’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. “More importantly, Microsoft offered the flexibility to innovate over time on both the technology and sales side, as well as strong privacy protections for our members.”
It has been an ugly few months for Netflix. The company has laid off hundreds of staff members, and its stock price has gone into a tailspin. On Tuesday, the company garnered fewer Emmy nominations than its rival HBO, despite having significantly more programming than the cable network and its streaming service, HBO Max. Netflix will announce its second-quarter earnings next week, and previously said it could lose another two million subscribers during the quarter.
Netflix executives hope that introducing a lower-priced advertising tier will attract cost-conscious subscribers. Some analysts have cautioned that by introducing a cheaper service, the streaming service could cannibalize from its base of subscribers who pay more for a commercial-free experience.
“At launch, consumers will have more options to access Netflix’s award-winning content,” said Mikhail Parakhin, the president of web experiences at Microsoft. “Marketers looking to Microsoft for their advertising needs will have access to the Netflix audience and premium connected TV inventory.”"

What Biden wants from the Saudis
President Biden, on his first visit to the Middle East since taking office, is embracing his predecessor’s approach to diplomacy in the region: deals as a path to peace. Biden has not been shy about his support for the Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries. But he did vow during his election campaign to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for its human rights violations, and he refused to speak with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Tomorrow, under pressure as tight oil supplies hurt the U.S. economy, he will meet M.B.S. on his territory.
“A more secure and integrated Middle East benefits Americans in many ways,” the president wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece on Saturday, explaining the visit. “Its waterways are essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on. Its energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact on global supplies of Russia’s war in Ukraine.”

The U.S. wants Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. On Saturday, Biden will meet with leaders of six oil-producing states in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia. Officials say oil won’t be the focus of talks with the group or the kingdom, though it is expected to come up, and they hope the Saudis will commit to increasing production soon after.
Even if that happens, there is limited spare capacity. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the only OPEC members that report significant unused output. President Emmanuel Macron of France told Biden at the Group of 7 summit last month that the U.A.E.’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, told him that both countries are at or close to “maximum” production.
But the oil crunch may already be easing. A report yesterday from the International Energy Agency suggests that the worst of the supply crisis may be over. The agency cut forecasts for demand for this year and next, pointing to high prices that would reduce consumption and slow the global economy. And gas prices in the U.S. have fallen, reducing some of the pressure on Biden. Still, Darren Woods, the Exxon Mobil C.E.O., last month predicted up to five more years of “tight” oil markets.
In Israel, Biden is emphasizing “integration.” Israeli officials have encouraged the president’s meeting with Saudi Arabia. It may already be yielding deals — an agreement to open Saudi airspace to commercial flights from Israel, a move that airlines have reportedly been lobbying for, is in the works and could be announced this week. But neither nation is the primary motivation for this tour. “We have to counter Russia’s aggression, put ourselves in the best possible position to outcompete China, and work for greater stability in a consequential region of the world,” Biden wrote. “To do these things, we have to engage directly with countries that can impact those outcomes. Saudi Arabia is one of them.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Investors increasingly expect the Fed to raise rates by a full percentage point this month. After the sharp rise in consumer prices in June, the Fed is likely to continue increasing interest rates quickly, even if doing so risks tipping the economy into a recession. Inflation is likely to fall in July because of lower gas prices.
The crypto lender Celsius files for bankruptcy. The move comes a month after it froze withdrawals, raising the prospect that more than a million account holders will not be able to get their money back. An outflow of money from crypto investments has shaken the foundations of crypto banks and start-ups.
Higher fares and recession worries are not curbing the pent-up demand for air travel. Delta’s C.E.O., Ed Bastian, said yesterday that while demand was strong, the airline would limit its capacity, seeking to avoid cancellations and delays. Delta reported a profit of $735 million in the second quarter and said it expected steady demand into the winter.
The Gates Foundation will increase its giving. The foundation says it plans to raise the rate of its grant making to $9 billion each year by 2026 from nearly $6 billion before the pandemic. To put that in context, the Open Society Foundations, funded by George Soros and itself one of the nation’s biggest philanthropies, reported total spending in 2020 of $1.4 billion.
A senior executive at Alphabet leaves for Goldman Sachs. Jared Cohen, a founder and C.E.O. of Google Ideas, now known as Jigsaw, will join a new organization within Goldman, reporting to its C.E.O., David Solomon. The group, the Office of Applied Innovation, will focus on new technologies and will be headed by Cohen and George Lee, a veteran Goldman banker.

Why Netflix went with Microsoft
Yesterday, Netflix picked Microsoft to help build its ad-supported streaming service, which it says it will unveil by the end of the year. It’s been an ugly few months for Netflix, reports The Times’s John Koblin. The company has laid off hundreds of employees, and its stock price has gone into a tailspin.

Netflix appears to be betting that a lower-priced streaming service, paid for mainly by ads, can revive growth. But the move comes with risks, namely whether it will lure new subscribers, or just poach existing ones from its current offering. DealBook asked our colleague and longtime media watcher Ed Lee for insight on why Netflix chose Microsoft.

Netflix is taking a chance with Microsoft. Choosing Microsoft as its advertising partner over Google (whose business was built on digital advertising) and Comcast (whose NBCUniversal has sold ads for over half a century) could be seen as a deliberate snub. But it is also a risk. Those two giants were seen as front-runners to run Netflix’s new ad-supported tier because of their experience.
But the choice could also be seen as strategic. Both companies have competing streaming services. NBCUniversal owns Peacock, and Google owns the mother of all internet video, YouTube (as well as YouTube TV, a cable package delivered online). Netflix says it was looking for a partner to be able to grow its service with, not launch and then replace later on.
Microsoft is a big player in the world of online video and advertising. It sells ads on its Bing search engine and across its Xbox gaming platform. The choice also suggests that Netflix doesn’t yet have a ton of content available for its ad-supported service, because it will most likely take Microsoft longer to build out what is needed to start the service. The streamer has to renegotiate all of the licensed films and TV shows it carries to allow for ads. That process appears to be more fraught than Netflix first implied. That could delay its offering, but it could also have made it possible for Netflix to go with a relative newbie in the streaming space.

The pandemic limits work friendships
Early-career friendships can be life-defining. But since the coronavirus pandemic, they’ve become “something of an endangered species,” writes The Times’s Emma Goldberg. And that may continue with return-to-office timelines being repeatedly stretched. Goldberg spoke with dozens of people about the magic of their first work friends, and why those connections are so important to work itself. Here’s what Goldberg told DealBook she discovered.
The pandemic disrupted “soft work” — the relationship-building part of work. What is lost? Should employers care?
What was interesting to me was a lot of the older workers I spoke with, spoke to really tangible ways in which their work friends influenced their identities, their sense of self in the workplace and their career trajectories. One woman I interviewed said she really wanted to quit her job, and it was her best friend at work who intervened and helped her stick it out.
So I do think that companies and executives are going to have to wrestle with how to help people form these relationships that are going to shape their careers.

How do companies that stay hybrid or mostly remote support work friendships?
Companies are trying out so many different methods. Salesforce just opened up this site where people can come together for nature walks and meditation and all kinds of other fun in-person activities. Airbnb is saying that even though people never have to come back to the office, it is going to make a big effort to have people come together at least pretty regularly throughout the year. Zillow is renovating some of its office spaces to make them look more cozy — almost living-room areas where people can hang out together. So right now, we are in that kind of experimentation phase of seeing what actually works.
What do you think is the real point of an office?
Historically the office has been the assumption in terms of, that’s where work gets done, that’s where people go every day. And the gossip and the hanging out and the friendships were a byproduct of that — an accident, but one that turned out to be really important for the work and for productivity and for people feeling connected and engaged.
When the office got displaced, that happy accident of relationships and friendships went with it. And now people are wrestling with, if you’re not going to be able to fully reinstate what the old normal looks like, how do you at least capture some of the good that came out of the relationships and how that contributed to the quality of the work?

2022-07-15,"Investors had an awful start to the year as stocks twice entered bear market territory, falling more than 20 percent. Stocks didn’t hang there long the first time, but the second drop has proved more durable, as Wall Street has come to accept that inflation is more persistent and that the Federal Reserve will have to be more aggressive in combating it.
The S&P 500 lost 16.4 percent in the second quarter, leaving it 20.6 percent below its level at the end of 2021.
Where to now? While a bounce in stocks certainly seems due, investment advisers say a lasting recovery is unlikely for now. They warn that a recession is probably on the way, if it’s not here already, and that valuations remain high, even after the big decline.
“I think we’re in for a lot more pain, probably, in U.S. stocks,” said Meb Faber, chief investment officer of Cambria Investment Management. “Just to get back to historical valuations, we could easily go down a third from here.”

Ella Hoxha, a manager of global bond portfolios for Pictet Asset Management, said expectations still haven’t been adjusted to incorporate the likely risk of a recession. It may seem surprising that a recession could catch Wall Street by surprise when the conversation there is about little else. But until recently, Wall Street played down its chances and talked up the prospects of a soft landing, in which growth slows but the economy avoids major, prolonged disruption.
“The odds of a recession have gone up, but the markets have not fully priced in the recession case yet,” Ms. Hoxha said. “Not only is the Fed having to correct being too dovish last year, it has to unwind its balance sheet” by selling the bonds and other securities it bought to support the economy and markets.

Market forecasts are increasingly guided by assessments of how severe a recession will be, not whether one will occur. But the erosion in the economic outlook may still have further to go.
“The real question is not whether we have a recession, it’s how hard growth decelerates and how long the slowdown is sustained,” said Ron Temple, managing director of Lazard Asset Management. Most people, he said, still expect “a short, shallow recession.”

A recession hits stock prices mainly by depressing corporate earnings. Just as investors may not be sufficiently factoring in a recession, Mr. Temple said that earnings expectations might need to come down further before stocks hit bottom.
“One missing piece of this story is that earnings expectations are probably not in the right place,” he said. “We’re probably going to see more downgrades.”
The most likely outcome, in his view, is a further 10 percent decline in stocks, and his “bear case,” which might come into play with another bad inflation report, is for stocks to fall as much as 25 percent more as the yield on the 10-year Treasury rises to 4 percent from just under 3 percent on June 30.
Owners of domestic stock funds know all about bear cases. The average portfolio fell 15.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Morningstar, with funds focusing on technology and consumer cyclical companies each losing more than 20 percent. Still, funds that own utility and health care stocks managed to keep losses to single digits.

Inflation and a sluggish economy are not just American phenomena. Europe has the same issues, along with some particular complications that make dealing with them problematic.

The average international stock fund fell 13.3 percent in the quarter, with Europe and Latin America portfolios doing slightly worse than average. China funds managed to eke out a 3.7 percent gain.
When a recession looms, the almost inevitable losses in stocks are usually cushioned by gains in long-term Treasury bonds as the worsening economic conditions push yields lower. A Citi Research report said a 20 percent decline in stocks on average coincides with a 12 percent gain in 10-year Treasury prices.
Not this time. Perhaps because the Fed distorted the bond market for so long with artificially low interest rates and quantitative easing, when stocks began to fall this year, so did bonds. In the first half, the 20+ Year Treasury Bond iShares exchange-traded fund fell 22.5 percent. S&P 500 SPDR, an E.T.F. that tracks that stock index, fell 20.6 percent.
The average bond fund was down 5.7 percent in the second quarter, Morningstar said, as long-term government portfolios fell 13.1 percent. High-yield and emerging-market funds suffered higher-than-average losses, too.
Deciding where to put your money isn’t easy in the best of conditions, and the current conditions are far from that. Beyond the inflationary backdrop and recession worries, uncertainty is certain to linger for several months until the impact of the Fed’s tightening becomes clear, as pandemic-era measures are unwound and as disruptions to trade created by the war in Ukraine work their way through the economy.

Ms. Hoxha recommends long-term Treasury bonds after the drubbing they have taken, but her call is less an expression of support for them than of disdain for everything else. She would avoid shorter-term maturities — up to two years — and corporate and European debt.
“When you can get a 3.5 yield and have an unclear picture about equities, you start to get paid a premium to own Treasuries and possibly do better than you can get in cash,” she said. “But don’t go all in. Some cash with some Treasuries might be a good mix.”
Mr. Faber finds American stocks expensive, but “foreign developed market valuations are totally reasonable, emerging markets are downright cheap and the value cohort for both of those is cheaper than the broad market.”
He prefers high-quality value stocks, meaning companies that trade at low multiples of earnings even though they generate enough cash to return money regularly to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
Mr. Faber thinks investors benefit twice when they buy value stocks.
“Value is good because it’s cheap and because you’re avoiding something that’s stupid expensive,” he said. “Avoiding the really expensive stuff in the last year has really saved everyone’s bacon.”

Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, a fund management company, prefers American stocks. In a presentation of the company’s investment outlook, she emphasized quality, as Mr. Faber did, highlighting characteristics like resilient balance sheets and an ability to increase dividends. But she favors growth stocks — stocks of companies whose earnings are less sensitive to economic ups and downs.
Among bonds, she and her colleagues favor municipal and high-yield issues and would limit exposure to long-term Treasuries.
Mr. Temple said he considered it counterproductive to try to choose between value and growth stocks. His advice is to go with either as long as you stick with quality, which he defines as “companies with high returns on capital that can be sustained.” Stocks in those companies usually do better when the economy weakens as investors seek safety. This year, though, quality has underperformed.
Companies that he likes and that have been marked down include Microsoft, Amazon and Google’s parent, Alphabet. All three stand to benefit from a continued move of business computing to the cloud. Mr. Temple also recommends the payment card networks Visa and American Express.
He acknowledged that these companies’ stocks, like the market broadly, may have further to fall. But he said he expected them to be solid buys over the long haul, even if holding them for the next few months may get uncomfortable.
“I’m not smart enough to pick the absolute low,” Mr. Temple said. “There are really good, quality companies that are on sale that you want to own for the next three to five years. We’re seeing more opportunities as this sell-off continues.”"

What’s Up? (July 10-16)
Twitter Plays Offense
In Elon Musk’s saga with Twitter, the end of one chapter is just the start of another. Shortly after signaling that he was backing out of his deal to buy the social media company, Mr. Musk was sued by Twitter. The company accused him of “knowingly, intentionally, willfully and materially” breaching their agreement. Mr. Musk’s lawyers said on Friday that Twitter’s request in the suit for an expedited trial in September was unreasonable and asked to delay it. When, and if, the case goes to trial, a judge in Delaware’s Court of Chancery will decide whether Mr. Musk’s claims that Twitter withheld information about spam accounts on the site are valid. The two parties could also settle, with Mr. Musk paying damages. Or, if his financing falls through, he could get out of the deal by paying a $1 billion breakup fee. Another possibility still is that Mr. Musk’s threat to walk away spooks Twitter into renegotiating with him, which could result in his buying the company at a discount. Worried shareholders will hear about how much damage Mr. Musk may have done when Twitter releases its second-quarter earnings this week.
Inflation Quickens
Already fast-rising prices picked up again last month, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report. The fresh inflation data showed prices surging 9.1 percent in June from a year ago. Record gas prices were the main driver of the high inflation figure. They have since dropped sharply — a factor that could lead to signs of moderation in July’s report. President Biden focused on this possibility in his response to the new numbers, calling them “out of date.” But even so-called core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, was higher than expected, at 5.9 percent. And overall there was little to be upbeat about in last week’s report, with experts saying it presented a significant challenge for the Federal Reserve as well as U.S. consumers.
The Euro’s Tumble
For the first time in 20 years, €1 equaled $1, after the euro reached parity with the dollar last week. The currency has been slipping since the beginning of the year because of disruptions to trade, sanctions on Russian energy after the country’s invasion of Ukraine and soaring prices for food and commodities in the eurozone. And as the euro waned, the dollar grew stronger, buoyed by investors who have turned to the American currency as a safe haven amid global economic upheaval. It appears that this dynamic will persist, even as the United States deals with its own economic strains.

Rising Interest Rates on the Agenda"
2022-07-18,
2022-07-19,"Late last month, more than 10.4 million subscribers to a YouTube channel received a notification that usually brought good news: Technoblade, an expert Minecraft player, had posted a new video.
For fans, each new video held the promise of Technoblade’s warm humor, whether he was winning a tournament or going on an inexplicable quest to produce more potatoes than anyone else in a Minecraft minigame.
But when fans clicked play on this latest video, called “so long nerds,” it was immediately obvious something was wrong. Instead of showing Minecraft gameplay, a man identifying himself as Technoblade’s father appeared. He announced that his son, whose first name was Alex, had died after being diagnosed with cancer.
Image
Technoblade’s father read a message from his son in a video announcement of his death that has been viewed more than 25 million times.
The video has been viewed more than 72.9 million times since it was published on June 30 as the fans who used to look forward to Technoblade’s notifications try to process the death of someone they have known only through a screen.

Social media is flooded with fan art, tributes and links to grief resources. Memorials have been erected within Minecraft, including a digital book that had been signed by more than 377,000 people.
The grief has ricocheted offline, including into the home of Noelle, 13, and her sister Ilana, 11, who had recently told their aunt to name her baby Technoblade.
In a video call from their home near Toronto, Noelle said she learned that Alex had died on her last day of school.
“I was just a mess,” she said. “I was just sitting in my room crying. I didn’t know what to do.”
Ilana, who dressed up as Technoblade’s avatar, a pig in a crown, for Halloween, said, “I don’t like to bring up the topic when I am just sitting with others.”

They both started watching Alex’s videos in late 2020. They liked his lighthearted banter with other Minecraft players and how he would monologue about the absurdity of routine parts of life, like using, and losing, a box to carry soap to a communal shower in college.
Alex spoke over screen recordings of himself playing Minecraft, the immensely popular video game developed by Mojang Studios in which players can create their own world piece by piece and compete against others online. The game developer was later bought by Microsoft.
The guided gameplay had garnered such a following that the company made a tribute to Technoblade on its launch page after he died. Mojang Studios said Technoblade “became synonymous with a source of good” in an emailed statement.
Among Technoblade’s most beloved game adventures was his whimsical quest to make more potatoes than anyone else in Minecraft, a feat first documented in The Great Potato War video, which had 35.8 million views.
In the video, Alex makes several references to Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War,” as he tries to topple the top potato producer at the time, a player who uses the moniker im_a_squid_kid. After Technoblade sees that his competition has created a rendering of the Mona Lisa in his Minecraft lair, he declares that im_a_squid_kid is not just “a potato madman, but a potato supervillain.”

Shielding an offline identity
In Alex’s videos, he talked about going to college (and dropping out to play Minecraft full time) and made occasional references to his family, but there was a clear boundary between Alex, the son and brother, and Technoblade. His family has sought to maintain that privacy since his death and declined to be interviewed.
Alex announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer in an August 2021 video threaded with jokes in which he also mentioned that he was 22 at the time. He did not specify what type of cancer he had, but his followers assumed that he had sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that is found in bone and soft tissues, because he created a fund-raiser for the Sarcoma Foundation of America on his YouTube page. He had raised more than $500,000 for the organization before the “so long nerds” video was published.
The foundation, which created a special donation page for Technoblade, said that an estimated 17,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with sarcoma in 2022, and more than 7,200 people will die from the disease.
After Alex died, his fans encouraged eligible people to donate blood to help cancer patients.
Riley, a 21-year-old in Connecticut, routinely donates blood in honor of a friend who died of sarcoma, and she made her most recent donation in Technoblade’s honor. She said his death was all the more difficult because of her earlier loss. “I was bawling like a baby for a couple hours,” she said. (Riley spoke on the condition that her last name not be used because she has faced online harassment.)

Riley, 21, of Connecticut, said that Technoblade inspired her to start streaming videos of herself playing video games under the name Notable_Crayon.

She has played Minecraft for about 10 years, but she did not discover Technoblade until the early days of the pandemic when she was working grueling shifts at a grocery store. “There was not a lot of joy in my life being an essential worker,” she said.
She liked Technoblade’s humor and introduced his videos to some of her co-workers, who were reminded of his famous potato war at work. “We were stocking potatoes one night and we just started laughing,” she said.
Technoblade inspired Riley to start broadcasting videos of herself playing video games, or streaming, under the name Notable_Crayon. It has been a great way to unwind, she said, but it has also shown her why someone as popular as Technoblade would protect his offline identity.

Occasionally people will figure out Riley’s full name and send her “creepy” messages, she said. She also has a friend who was the victim of swatting, false reports of crimes in progress intended to draw armed police to the victim’s home. Her friend was not hurt, but others have been harmed, with one man killed by the police and another dying of a heart attack.
In the “so long nerds” video, Alex’s father read a letter that he said his son wrote about eight hours before he died. In the letter, Alex acknowledged the consequences of sharing personal information online and revealed that he and a sibling had successfully convinced online fans that his first name was Dave by using the name in a 2016 video, which was later deleted.
Alex said the prank resulted in “thousands of creepy online dudes trying to get overly personal, going, ‘Oh hey, Dave, how’s it going?’”
Navigating the loss of an online friend
For some fans, the mystery of Alex’s identity has added a confusing layer to the muddle of grief.
Richard England, a vicar at Crofton Parish on the south coast of Britain, said that his teenagers were both devastated by Alex’s death and that they had a few conversations about how not knowing Technoblade’s offline identity affected their grieving.
“Through this new online, offline world we have, many of them will feel like they will know Technoblade and other members of those online communities better than they know kids in their own school,” Mr. England, 47, said. “They will have spent just as much time with them.”
In Canada, Noelle and Ilana’s mother, Janice, admitted she was skeptical at first about the idea that you could have fun watching videos of someone else playing video games. But she said the girls had educated her about the Minecraft world and its personalities, which she now appreciates.
Janice, 52, was well suited to handle her children’s grief about Technoblade because she said she previously worked with children in grief as a child life specialist, a role that helps children and families cope with stress they experience because of health problems, hospitalization and bereavement.

She said that adults tend to want to protect children from uncomfortable feelings, but that it was important to give them space to express, or not express, how they were feeling about Technoblade.
“If we help our children through grief when they experience it,” she said, “then they will be better able to cope with it when they are older and have other situations in their lives that would cause them to be grieving.”

In the video call with her daughters, Janice said her sister in Maryland had called after Technoblade died, because her son was also a big fan. The boy had decided to raise money for the sarcoma foundation, Janice said, prompting Ilana to turn toward her mother and ask: “Is there a way I can help him with that?”"

2022-07-22,"LVIV, Ukraine — The hassles never end for Yuriy Adamchuk, a Ukrainian executive who spends most of his waking hours coaxing 3,000 software coders to deliver projects on time, despite the obstacles and occasional horrors of war and a never-ending series of interruptions.
Sitting in his office, he starts to elaborate, then is interrupted. The sounds of air raid sirens fill the streets of this historic, elegant city and an automated voice is heard, from loudspeakers in all directions, urging citizens to head to the nearest bomb shelter.
From Mr. Adamchuk, the 43-year-old chief operating officer of Avenga, a software developer based in Lviv, there is no sense of concern. He resigns himself to evacuating the building and stands up, wearing a turquoise Lacoste shirt and the grudging smile of a world-weary man.
“It kind of kills off your productivity,” he says, gathering a few belongings and heading downstairs along with a handful of other employees. “Early on, it happened twice a day.”

Despite this and many genuinely terrifying intrusions, the tech sector is thriving in Ukraine, a rare bit of upbeat news in a nation in deep economic distress. Through supply chain disruptions, port blockades and even theft, Russia has throttled the grain industry and the trade in metals, Ukraine’s largest exports. The economy is expected to shrink a startling 30 percent this year, says the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, helping to spark global inflation and adding to fears of recession and job losses.
But there is no way to lay siege to the 200,000 computer engineers and code writers in this country, professionals who need just a laptop and an internet connection to earn a living. Figures from the National Bank of Ukraine show that in the first five months of this year, technology companies brought in $3.1 billion in revenue from thousands of customers, many in the Fortune 500, a jump from $2.5 billion a year earlier.
Instead of exultant, executives and tech workers interviewed here sounded anxious about a looming drop-off — and worried that they had little recourse to stop it. One practical problem: Ukrainian men ages 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. That has ended almost all the glad-handing that is a part of client maintenance and the face-to-face interactions that are all but required to win new business.
Customers from Silicon Valley to Seoul have offered lots of ardent “We stand with Ukraine” affirmations during video calls, tech executives say, and many seem eager to support and enrich the country. The worry is that at some point, perhaps soon, this noble impulse will collide with the unsentimental imperatives of running a business.

“You have only a short period of empathy from customers,” Mr. Adamchuk said before the sirens went off that recent afternoon. “There is some period of empathy, and then it will pass. At that point the question is: Can you deliver or not?”

The answer now carries outsize weight. “These companies are getting paid in dollars and euros, and if we don’t have that, we won’t be able to pay for petrol for the army or for medication and our currency will depreciate and that will spur inflation,” said Hlib Vyshlinsky, director of the Center for Economic Strategy, a think tank in Kyiv. “I.T. is crucial.”
In mid-May, a group of tech companies met with Yulia Svyrydenko, the minister of economic development and trade, to ask for an exemption that would allow business leaders to exit and re-enter the country.
She sounded receptive, people at the meeting said, but no action has been taken yet. Konstantin Vasyuk, the head of the IT Ukraine Association, thinks his members, and with them the rest of Ukraine, will soon begin to suffer.
“We’ll be replaced with other I.T. providers,” he predicted. “It will happen gradually, over one, two, three months. Maybe four. But it will happen.”

Sleeping in the office
Best known as “the breadbasket to the world,” Ukraine has long put a singular focus on computer engineering, which started in the Soviet era when one front of the Cold War involved outclassing the United States in scientific fields. Since independence in 1991, parents and educators have pushed English as the language of international commerce.
Before the invasion in February, the administration of President Volodymyr Zelensky began pitching Ukraine to governments and investors around the world as if it were a shiny new gadget. It created the Ministry of Digital Transformation, which did road shows to present the country as the cutting-edge destination where taxes were low, paperwork was minimal and talent was abundant. Cryptocurrency entrepreneurs were vigorously beckoned.
The ministry says the country is home to roughly 5,000 technology companies, working in e-commerce, game and app development; cryptocurrency software; and web upgrades. Hourly rates are about 10 to 20 percent less than rivals in places like Poland, and the customers range from tiny operations looking for outsourced assistance to companies like Microsoft, Google and Samsung.

Every company that had a headquarters in eastern Ukraine has its own close-call story. On the day of the invasion, Oleg Chernyak, the head of business development at CHI Software in Kharkiv, got a call from a friend in the military who asked him to bring a shovel and an ax to help build a fortification in the north of the city. (“I’m a camping man,” Mr. Chernyak explained.) Soon after he arrived, a Russian fighter pilot dropped bombs that landed about 300 feet away.

“We spent some time laying face down on the ground,” he recalled. “That’s the moment I realized, I need to move my family out of the city.”
He drove his wife and child to the Polish border, and they now live in Barcelona, Spain, along with a baby born a few weeks ago. About 470 CHI employees also left Kharkiv, some 600 miles from Lviv, and have settled there, along with Mr. Chernyak. More than a dozen ended up living for weeks at the company’s office here, spread around a handful of rooms.
They used the office kitchen to cook borscht, meatballs, potatoes and other meals and showered in the restrooms. By June, about five employees were still spending their nights in an office cafeteria. There were sleeping bags on the floor and toiletries on a side table.
During a recent visit, about 20 people were working on computers in the kind of silence associated with chess matches. They took a break to chat about the odd purgatory of their current lives, a strange interregnum that is evolving into something more permanent.
When they all lived in the office, the place had the feel of a slumber party, with minimal debate about what movie to watch on the large-screen TV — one night it was “Taxi Driver,” another night an Avengers flick. The only rules were keep tidy and lights out at 10, part of a citywide prohibition to make Lviv a less visible target to the Russians.

“It was very comfortable for me,” said Ann Polevaya, the company’s office manager, after a quick walk through the premises.
She had recently moved to an apartment, and it isn’t close enough for her tastes. “I’m supposed to be here at 9 a.m.,” she said. “When I lived in that room,” and here she pointed over her shoulder, “I woke up at 8:45.”

A deadline interrupted by shelling
Technology companies have retained 95 percent of their contracts by volume, the IT Ukraine Association found. Mr. Adamchuk of Avenga knew of only one client that ended its dealings with the company, citing a protocol that barred it from hiring a vendor in a conflict zone. Other clients say that as much as they want to back Ukraine and help its economy, the war has given them pause. One problem has been turnover; about 5 percent of information technology workers have joined the military.
“My Ukrainian counterpart is replacing some of his team with temps, so it’s not always seamless,” said Nate Moshkovich of ClearLine Mobile, a Los Angeles company that works with a software developer, Allmatics, which is still based in Kyiv, though many of its employees now live in other cities and countries. “I care deeply about these people, but my project needed to move faster. So I augmented my team by hiring in India.”

Dr. John Salmon, a pathologist in Lynchburg, Va., was initially skeptical that Cleveroad, his Ukrainian I.T. vendor, could maintain its work pace as it helped him build and fine-tune a social media app called Delta Sport. When news of the invasion broke, he had to wonder if he should hire an outfit in a less volatile part of the world.
“I think I’d be a poor businessperson if I didn’t consider it,” he said. “I’ve got three employees in the U.S., we’ve got patents, and we’re looking for investors. I’ve got a family, and I owe it to them to be smart, and it wouldn’t do if I mismanaged this project and it dies.”
On Feb. 25, a day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Dr. Salmon got on the phone with the project manager, who provided reassurances, and work has continued smoothly. With one exception. On a Friday night in early April, a few weeks before launching on Google Play and Apple’s App Store, Delta Sport wasn’t loading properly in beta tests on Android phones. A message sent to Cleveroad went unanswered for 48 hours, far from the nearly instant response that is the norm. That Monday, Dr. Salmon learned why.
Much of the team had spent the weekend in basements, getting bombarded by Russian missiles.
That hiccup aside, the company shifted to a higher gear.
“They actually picked up speed,” Dr. Salmon said. “I mean, I approve every line of code, as it’s written, so I can see how fast they are working, in real time. They’ve worked harder. The project manager told me: ‘We have to do this. This is how we fight.’”

Recruiting new customers, as opposed to pleasing existing ones, has proved more difficult. Daryna Hameliak, who generates business leads at Avenga, once hastily ended a sales call at her parents’ home in Irpin because she heard missiles landing a few miles away.
She has been deflected by a few potential customers, and some bluntly explained that they were concerned that deadlines wouldn’t be met, given the precarious situation in many Ukrainian cities.
“What’s really frustrating are the clients who work with Russian companies and aren’t willing to change,” Ms. Hameliak said. “I try to be polite.”
The corruption problem
Last year, the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International ranked Ukraine as the second-most-corrupt country in Europe, behind Russia. For years, a small group of oligarchs owned a huge swath of the economy, and bribery was commonplace. As bad, a shadow economy of unreported transactions has long eroded the tax base. Four years ago, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology estimated that 47 percent of Ukraine’s gross domestic product was essentially invisible to the government.

The situation is improving, many executives here say, as more companies vie for contracts in the international economy, where integrity is more highly prized. But young entrepreneurs understand that, before the war turned the country into a symbol of resistance, it had an image problem. And there was no point in waiting for the government to fix it, or even provide basic social services, like a safety net. People here live on what they earn or they don’t retire, or they live in misery.
Staffs understood that companies were at risk of hemorrhaging customers and would disappear if they could not prove that they were every bit as viable as they were the day before hostilities began. Plus, focusing on work was a good way to ignore unfolding horrors.
“We felt a lot of emotions, and most of them were pretty negative,” said Illia Shevchenko, a Ukrainian manager at EPAM Systems, a digital product design company that is based in Pennsylvania and has offices around Ukraine. “The best way to distract yourself from these emotions is to work. There’s a specific task. You sit down and think about it.”
Mr. Shevchenko was speaking over a video call from a small bedroom in an apartment in Kremenchuk, where his wife and two children moved soon after Kharkiv, their former hometown, was attacked. He wore a red T-shirt with an illustration of Einstein on it, and gave a tour of his new office that lasted about six seconds. He lifted his laptop and pointed it at the tiny table and chair where he now works.
“We found this place through friends of friends,” Mr. Shevchenko said. “It took two days to get a stable internet connection.” From this perch, he oversees 140 engineers, working on game tech and Java script projects.

Whatever the reason — fear of penury in old age or a work ethic that is “coded in the national DNA,” as a Cleveroad manager put it — Ukraine seems to burst with entrepreneurial drive. A good place to view this phenomenon is Promprylad, a 40,000-square-foot innovation center under construction in Ivano-Frankivsk, a town of 240,000 about 80 miles southeast of Lviv.
The structure is a former Soviet factory — the name translates to “Industrial Equipment,” which was what the factory produced decades ago — and about 15 percent of it has already been refurbished for a wide array of companies and projects. Wander around and you’ll find an art gallery, a co-working space, a dance studio, a restaurant, an espresso bar and dozens of other enterprises.

Then there’s the atelier of Anoeses, makers of erotic lingerie with a bondage theme — think leather underwear, gags, leashes, handcuffs, masks and collars with plenty straps, zippers and chains. Among the company’s fans is Madonna, who sported an Anoeses corset in an Instagram post in March as well as in a video and during shows.
“I think it started when Madonna’s daughter Lourdes wore one of our corsets to an event,” said the company’s marketing director, Olya Tretyak.

Anoeses couldn’t capitalize on a surge of interest when fans figured out where Madonna had bought the $450 garment. At the time, the company had shut down its website so all 30 of its employees could flee its former headquarters in Kyiv as the Russian military threatened the city.
“We were sitting in bomb shelters,” Ms. Tretyak said, “and we didn’t want people to buy and then wait.”

A handful of projects like Promprylad are under construction across the country.
“We have hundreds of old Soviet factories and brownfields like this in Ukraine,” said Yuriy Filyuk, the chief executive of Promprylad, which has $12 million in funds from more than 1,000 investors, some private (BMW, Bosch) and others public (the U.S. Agency for International Development).
He was talking next to a scale model of the complex, which has five separate, but connected, multistory buildings. It was either an urbanist’s dream or the febrile vision of a hipster utopian. When Mr. Filyuk walked by the restaurant, Promfood, he pointed down to an unfinished courtyard, little more than scattered bricks.

“We’re going to have craft breweries there,” he said.
Once completed, in late 2023, Promprylad will be home to 150 companies, a dozen or so of them in tech. The plans presume that the tech sector remains vibrant, hardly a foregone conclusion when you speak to people like Mr. Chernyak of CHI Software. He thinks the company is about to lose out on a lot of new contracts.
“I’ve been prospecting recently in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and for some reason, in-person meetings are absolutely essential there,” he said. “So I have two or three calls a day with clients saying: ‘Guys, please come to visit. We understand it’s difficult, but find a way.’”
Even with so much banter now comfortably online, there is a difference between sustaining a business relationship and starting one.
“Looking into the eyes of customers is important,” said Mr. Adamchuk of Avenga. “And not through some web interface.”

By this point in our interview, the air missile siren had forced him to head down four flights of stairs to a shelter at the end of an adjacent street. A line of people filed into the first floor of an old office building, then to the basement, where a fluorescent light flickered cinematically. About 30 workers from a variety of companies were soon mingling, as if at a social event that nobody had planned, in what looked like a changing room for employees, with racks of hangers and plenty of benches.
A cell signal was available for anyone who walked up the basement stairs and stuck a hand through the open door. People took turns, getting updates on Telegram channels and apps that regularly relayed government news. One said a missile had landed in Zolochiv, about 40 miles away.
The all-clear sign chirped on phones 90 minutes after the siren had first gone off. The group filed back upstairs, past an elderly woman who was sweeping the floor and who had never bothered to enter the basement. Without raising her eyes or pausing, she cursed all of Russia.
“Taking our youngest generation,” was the printable part.

2022-07-26,"SEATTLE — The uncertainty and challenges in the global economy have hit Microsoft, which on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street’s and its own expectations.
The tech giant said it had $51.9 billion in sales in the quarter ended June 30, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Profit rose 2 percent to $16.7 billion.
The results missed even Microsoft’s own reduced expectations. In early June, the company lowered its guidance for the quarter to account for the increasingly strong U.S. dollar.
“We’re obviously incredibly bullish on just about everything else that we have,” Chris Capossela, the company’s marketing chief, said after the revised guidance was released. “That’s one thing we can’t control.”

Since then, the conditions appear to have deteriorated further. The foreign currency challenges spurred by the war in Ukraine and broader economic uncertainty cost Microsoft $595 million in the quarter as it converted sales in Europe, Japan and elsewhere back into U.S. dollars. And production slowdowns of personal computers in China and falling consumer demand caused a decline of more than $300 million in sales of its Windows operating system that comes preinstalled on new computers.
A slowdown in advertising spending on LinkedIn and on Microsoft’s search products caused more than a $100 million decline in revenue.
Were it not for currency problems, Microsoft’s flagship cloud computing platform, Azure, would have grown 46 percent. Instead, it grew 40 percent, short of what investors expected. Without the strengthening dollar, the company’s two main enterprise lines of business, which it calls Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud, would have met the initial guidance it provided investors in April.
“Commercial demand overall felt pretty healthy,” Brett Iversen, Microsoft’s head of investor relations, said in an interview on Tuesday. “The long-term thesis of people wanting to move to the cloud to digitize their business, to be able to do more or to be able to save money — all of that still feels intact.”
He said that was reflected in strong long-term bookings commitments, including a record number of Azure deals worth more than $1 billion.

Overall revenue for Microsoft’s commercial cloud computing offerings, which also includes Office 365 subscriptions, increased 28 percent to $25 billion.
“We are not immune to what is happening in the macro broadly,” Satya Nadella, the company’s chief executive, said in a call with Wall Street analysts. But he said the continued interest that businesses have in using cloud services, which bills in part based on consumption, reflects companies efforts to make do with less.
“Moving to the cloud is the best way to shape your spend with demand uncertainty,” he said.
Microsoft’s personal computing business grew 2 percent to $14.4 billion, dragged down by the 2 percent decline in sales of its Windows operating system that comes preinstalled on personal computers. Investors were prepared to see some weakness because shipments of PCs are down from weakened demand and supply chain problems brought on by coronavirus lockdowns in China.
Revenue from Xbox content and services fell 6 percent, as consumers spent less time playing video games.
With unemployment remaining near the lowest levels in 50 years, LinkedIn, the professional social network Microsoft bought in 2016, grew 26 percent, down from 34 percent growth the previous quarter.

The company said it had $126 million in expenses related to scaling down its operations in Russia, and another $113 million in costs for paying severance to employees it laid off.
Mr. Iversen said the layoffs were for “a small number of roles” and the company expected to expand its head count in the new fiscal year, which started July 1.
In the call with Wall Street analysts, Mr. Nadella and Amy Hood, Microsoft’s finance chief, said beyond the strong dollar, the company expected some challenges to persist, such as reduced demand for personal computers, fewer paid job postings on LinkedIn and lower demand from small- and medium-size businesses.
But they said Microsoft would continue investing in markets where it has advantages and expected double-digit revenue growth in the next year, even if foreign exchange headwinds continued. The company’s share price increased about 5 percent in after market trading."

What tech earnings say about the economy
The long-booming bottom lines of major tech companies are all of a sudden smaller than expected. That might be a good thing. Big Tech sailed through the pandemic with its profits mostly intact. The fact that some firms’ results are now flagging could be a positive sign for the Federal Reserve, which is trying to engineer a slowdown as it fights the nation’s worst bout of inflation in four decades.
The big question for investors, and perhaps the Fed, is whether the profits of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and the other tech giants, along with corporate America in general, have fallen enough.
Microsoft and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, kicked off what appears to be a disappointing round of quarterly reports for the U.S.’s largest tech companies yesterday. Meta will release its results this afternoon, with Apple and Amazon rounding out Big Tech’s earnings announcements tomorrow.
Microsoft’s profits, while below expectations, were still up. Sales of its signature software products, like Office, rose 13 percent. Its cloud services were up 40 percent. And LinkedIn, the professional social network Microsoft bought in 2016, grew 26 percent from a year ago, continuing to benefit from the tightest job market in decades.
Alphabet’s sales rose 13 percent. In another good sign for the economy, the jump was driven by better-than-expected sales in its core Google search engine business, while results were mixed elsewhere. A jump in expenses and an exit from its Russian-related businesses caused profits to slump 14 percent.
The results were positive enough for investors. Alphabet’s shares rose nearly 5 percent on the earnings news to $110. Microsoft’s shares jumped $10, or nearly 4 percent, to $262. Executives at both companies said they saw evidence of a weaker economy. “We are not immune to what is happening in the macro broadly,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts. Alphabet’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told analysts that a pullback in spending by some advertisers reflected “uncertainty about a number of factors.”
Few are betting that the earnings reports will change the Fed’s approach. Its policymakers are meeting this week, and they are widely expected to continue raising benchmark interest rates. While central bankers “will likely acknowledge a recent weakening in economic momentum, the Fed will likely feel the need to appear resolute in battling inflation until there are clear signs that it is abating,” wrote David Kelly, the chief global strategist of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a note to clients earlier this week.

Shares of Coinbase, a larger crypto exchange, plunged yesterday after reports that the S.E.C. was investigating whether it allowed trading in unregistered securities. Cathie Wood’s Ark funds reportedly dumped Coinbase shares yesterday for the first time this year.
Antitrust legislation aimed at Big Tech may be off the table for now. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told donors at a Capitol Hill fund-raiser yesterday that the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which he had promised to bring to a vote this summer, lacks the support needed to get it to the Senate floor, Bloomberg reported. The bill’s bipartisan backers have been pressuring Schumer to act fast, before midterm elections that could change the balance of power in Congress.
One America News, once a dependable Trump promoter, is struggling to survive. The network is being dropped by major carriers and faces a wave of defamation lawsuits for its outlandish stories about the 2020 election. OAN’s most recent blow is from Verizon, which will stop carrying the network on its Fios television service this week. It is now available to only a few thousand people who subscribe to regional cable providers.
Teva Pharmaceuticals reaches a tentative $4.25 billion settlement over opioids. The proposed settlement, which is with some 2,500 local governments, states and tribes, would end thousands of lawsuits against one of the largest producers of the painkillers during the height of the opioid epidemic.
Florida’s largest utility secretly funded a website that attacked its critics. Florida Power & Light bankrolled and controlled The Capitolist, a news site aimed at Florida lawmakers, through intermediaries from an Alabama consulting firm, an investigation by The Miami Herald found. The site claimed to be independent, but it advocated rate hikes and legislative favors in efforts that were directed by top executives at the utility.

BlackRock downshifts on E.S.G.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, slashed its support for shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues this year, backing only 24 percent of such resolutions in the proxy season that ended in June, down from 43 percent in the previous period. The firm, which has long led the conscious investing movement, said this year’s proposals were “less supportable” and cited new regulatory guidance that opened the door to a broader range of policy-related proposals.

The firm has criticized overly “prescriptive” resolutions. In a May memo, BlackRock signaled that Russia’s war in Ukraine was straining global energy supplies and shifting its calculations. “Many climate-related shareholder proposals sought to dictate the pace of companies’ energy transition plans despite continued consumer demand,” wrote the firm’s global head of investment stewardship, Sandy Boss. She noted that shareholders generally supported fewer environmental and social proposals this year as well, voting for 27 percent of resolutions, down from 36 percent in the previous proxy period.

Opposition to E.S.G. is mounting. The environmental, social and governance investment push has been labeled “woke capitalism” by critics and is under fire from executives like Tesla’s Elon Musk, major investors like Bill Ackman and Republican politicians. In a speech yesterday, former Vice President Mike Pence, a possible 2024 hopeful, said that big government and big business were together advancing a “pernicious woke agenda.”
E.S.G. supporters say critics may have a point. Andrew Behar, C.E.O. of the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, agrees that many supposed E.S.G. investments don’t reflect true sustainability — with ever more capital directed toward the idea and many funds failing to live up to their promises. Behar argued that more corporate disclosures — which anti-E.S.G. groups oppose — would help to ensure that green investing actually works. He argues that critics also ignore a key financial incentive driving investor interest: knowing and lowering the costs of environmental issues throughout company operations, including risks from changing weather and the transition to more sustainable models. “We don’t have an E.S.G. problem,” Behar told DealBook. “We have a naming problem.”

Instagram tries to explain itself
Instagram responded yesterday to criticism from some of its most popular users, including Kylie Jenner, about new features that made it more like its top rival, TikTok, the fast-growing video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.

Adam Mosseri, Instagram’s head, said that it was experimenting with several changes, and that he knew users were unhappy. “It’s not yet good,” he said of some of the tweaks in a video post. He stressed Instagram’s commitment to photos, the app’s original focus, but said, “I’m going to be honest, I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time.”
Reels, a short-video product, is one of the six main investment priorities at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, according to an internal memo last month from Chris Cox, the company’s chief product officer. Cox said that users had doubled the amount of time they spent on Reels year over year, and that Meta would prioritize boosting ads in Reels “as quickly as possible.” Last week, Instagram announced that almost all videos in the app would be posted as Reels.
The changes come as Meta heads into a new phase. Mark Zuckerberg, its founder and chief executive, has cut costs, reshuffled his leadership team and made clear that low-performing employees will be let go, writes The Times’s Mike Isaac. “Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” Zuckerberg said on a call late last month. In recent months, profit at Meta has fallen and revenue has slowed as the company has spent lavishly on augmented and virtual reality projects, and as the economic slowdown has hurt its advertising business.
The high-profile complaints about Instagram’s revamp started in recent days, when Kylie Jenner, the beauty mogul with 361 million Instagram followers, shared an image on the site that read: “Make Instagram Instagram again. (stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.”
“PRETTY PLEASE,” Kim Kardashian, Jenner’s half sister and the seventh-most-followed Instagram user, echoed in a later post. Yesterday, Chrissy Teigen, a model and author with 39 million followers, responded to Mosseri in a tweet, saying, “we don’t wanna make videos Adam lol.”
Companies have reason to listen when social media stars speak up, writes The Times’s Kalley Huang. In 2018, after Snapchat overhauled its interface, Jenner tweeted: “sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me….” Within a week, Snap, the app’s parent company, had lost $1.3 billion in market value.

2022-07-28,"WASHINGTON — Early in her tenure as chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan declared that she would rein in the power of the largest technology companies in a dramatically new way.
“We’re trying to be forward looking, anticipating problems and taking fast action,’’ Ms. Khan said in an interview last month. She promised to focus on “next-generation technologies,” and not just on areas where tech behemoths were already well established.
This week, Ms. Khan took her first step toward stopping the tech monopolies of the future when she sued to block a small acquisition by Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, of the virtual-reality fitness start-up Within. The deal was significant for Meta’s development of the so-called metaverse, which is a nascent technology and far from mainstream.
In doing so, Ms. Khan upended decades of antitrust standards, potentially setting off a wholesale shift in the way Washington enforces competition across corporate America. At the heart of the F.T.C.’s lawsuit is the idea that regulators can apply antitrust law without waiting for a market to mature to the point where it is clear which companies hold the most power. The F.T.C. said such early action was justified because Meta’s deal would probably eliminate competition in the young virtual-reality market.
Since the late 1970s, most federal challenges to mergers have been in large, well-established markets and aim to prevent already clear monopolies. Regulators have mostly rubber-stamped the purchases of start-ups by tech giants, such as Google’s 2006 deal to buy YouTube and Facebook’s 2012 acquisition of Instagram, because those markets were still emerging.
As a result, Ms. Khan faces an uphill climb. Regulators have been reluctant to try to stop corporate mergers by relying on the theory that competition and consumers will be harmed in the future. The federal government lost at least two cases that used this strategy in the past decade, including an attempt to block a $1.9 billion merger in 2015 among X-ray sterilization providers that the F.T.C. had predicted would harm future competition in regional markets."
2022-07-29,"When the president, the treasury secretary and other Biden administration officials insisted this week that the American economy is not currently in a recession, they were mocked for weaseling out of bad news on a technicality. The Commerce Department announced on Thursday that the broadest measure of economic activity, gross domestic product, fell for a second quarter in a row — meeting a widely held, though unofficial, definition of recession. It is true, as the Biden folks argued, that the nation’s official recession arbiter, the National Bureau of Economic Research, has yet to call one, because it relies on many more signals. Still, it sure sounded as if the Biden team was splitting hairs.
Over the past few days, though, I’ve spent more time than is healthy listening to C.E.O.s expound on their businesses during quarterly corporate earnings calls. (What can I say? I’m a sucker for a good time.) And I was surprised by what I heard. The C.E.O.s convinced me that the Biden people — not to mention Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, who also said this week that a recession has probably not yet begun — have a point.
The economy is in a really weird place. There are definitely signs of trouble. Yet at some of the biggest companies in the country — especially in the tech industry — business is hardly all glum. And even at companies that are struggling, the numbers aren’t nearly as bad as investors had feared.
At the start of the week, I told my editor I’d be writing about how the tech industry might be facing one of its worst slowdowns in two decades. By the end of the week, I found myself backing off anything so dramatic. Yes, some companies are facing unusually difficult times. Business models are blowing up. Competition is heating up. Regulators are getting tougher. Hiring is slowing down. Workers are being asked to do more with less. And all that’s just at Facebook!

But there are also signs that some huge businesses are ably navigating tougher times — or, in a label adopted by so many C.E.O.s that I wondered if they agreed on it in a secret meeting, a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Consider some of the brightest spots: Qualcomm, the chip-making giant, reported that despite that “challenging macroeconomic environment,” profits grew more than 50 percent over last year because of strong sales of its processors used in phones and automobiles. Ford reported that hefty sales of its SUVs and crossovers pushed its adjusted earnings before taxes and interest to more than triple from a year ago. Meanwhile Visa, Mastercard and American Express said Americans are still spending as though there’s no tomorrow. “We’re seeing no evidence of a pullback in consumer spending,” Vasant Prabhu, Visa’s chief financial officer, told investors.
Many on Wall Street had been especially worried about results from the behemoths of Big Tech — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet and Meta, the parent companies of Google and of Facebook. These are among the most valuable American companies, and they soared during the pandemic. But this year Big Tech’s growth has slowed, and its stock prices have been crushed. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has been bullish on the tech giants, said that sentiment among tech investors was the most negative he’s seen since 2009.
Then on Tuesday, Microsoft and Alphabet released their numbers and turned the narrative around. Alphabet said its revenue grew by 13 percent over last year — lower than usual for a money-printing machine like Google but not much less than analysts had been expecting and better than many had feared. Ives said Google’s not-too-bad results suggested that the online advertising market was holding up.
Microsoft’s results were also lower than analysts had been expecting, but investors were still thrilled by them, especially the 40 percent growth in Microsoft’s cloud services business. Because Microsoft’s core business is in providing tech services to large companies, its strong cloud number shed a positive light on the entire economy, Ives said. “That was probably one of the most important data points in years for the tech sector,” he told me.

On Wednesday, Meta put out what for it are some pretty dismal numbers; among other things, for the first time, the company posted a drop in quarterly revenue from the same period a year ago. But expectations had been very low for Facebook. The company’s stock plummeted this year after it reported that Apple’s new privacy features have hampered its ability to collect data on users. It has also faced persistent competition from TikTok. And because Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, is spending billions to pivot the company from social networking to “the metaverse” — the still-in-development virtual realm that he believes will one day be at the center of our computing experience — its future looks more than a little cloudy.
But there was light even in Meta’s grim report. Zuckerberg said that Reels, the company’s competitor of TikTok, is gaining in popularity with users and with advertisers. Its user numbers have also held up. Meta has been dealing with so much bad news — this week the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would sue to block the company from purchasing a small virtual reality start-up — that expectations could hardly fall lower. “The street was expecting just an absolute legendary disaster,” Ives said. But compared with the expected hurricane of terrible earnings, Facebook’s numbers were more like “a little rainstorm,” he said.
After the markets closed on Thursday, Amazon and Apple reported their quarterly numbers. Guess what? They’re also mostly crushing it. Amazon said its cloud business grew by 33 percent over last year. Apple’s C.E.O. told CNBC that the company expects revenue to “accelerate” next quarter.
This year I argued that despite recent slowdowns, the reign of Big Tech was just beginning. As the economy softened over the course of the year, I began to doubt my bold prediction. But now I’m redoubling. Tech giants, like the rest of the economy, may soon face tougher times. But Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and even Facebook are weathering difficult times much better than expected. Big Tech isn’t going away anytime soon.

2022-08-02,"One of the first moves the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery made when it took over CNN was shutting down CNN+, the nascent streaming service that was touted as the network’s bridge to the future.
The next month, when Chris Licht took over as CNN’s chairman, he told employees in his first town hall meeting not to worry about ratings, a mainstay of TV news used as a benchmark for revenue and relevance.
Now, three months into Mr. Licht’s tenure, the network finds itself facing big questions about how it can continue to expand its business with its moonshot streaming service dead and the traditional TV business in structural decline.
Projections from S&P Global Market Intelligence say CNN’s profitability is on a pace to decline to $956.8 million this year. That would mark the first time since 2016 that the network had dipped below $1 billion in profit, according to three people familiar with its operations.

Two people familiar with CNN’s operations said the network’s initial 2022 profitability target was $1.1 billion, which Mr. Licht is on track to miss by more than $100 million. But another person familiar with the matter said that by the accounting of company executives, Mr. Licht was on track to meet a profitability target of roughly $950 million for the year, since the network’s initial budget didn’t account for losses associated with launching the CNN+ streaming service.
However the numbers are crunched, inside CNN the hunt is on for new revenue. To help solve the financial puzzle, Mr. Licht has tapped Chris Marlin, a longtime friend who was recently an executive at the Florida home builder Lennar. Mr. Marlin — whom some CNN employees have taken to calling “Fish Man,” a takeoff on his surname — had no experience operating a cable news network, having worked at the law firms Foley & Lardner and Holland & Knight.
Mr. Marlin has floated a variety of revenue-generating ideas since joining CNN, including striking advertising deals with major tech companies like Microsoft. Mr. Marlin has also mentioned selling sponsorships to corporate underwriters, extending CNN’s brand in China and expanding CNN Underscored, an e-commerce initiative.
CNN’s parent has also cracked down on expenses. In July, CNN employees received a revised travel and expense policy that, among other things, restricts spending on work celebrations for senior vice presidents and below to $50 per person (“no cap for C.E.O. of W.B.D.,” the policy reads). And Mr. Licht has found ways to make coverage more economical, including a recent decision not to send a U.S.-based special events team to Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee.
Mr. Licht, who took over CNN in May after a corporate merger made Warner Bros. Discovery its parent company, has tried to sell its staff on a vision for the network that isn’t tethered to traditional TV ratings. During a meeting with employees his first week, Mr. Licht said CNN would generate revenue by pitching advertisers on the network’s “pristine brand,” not just sheer audience size, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by The New York Times.

“I don’t want producers making decisions based on what they think will rate,” Mr. Licht said, according to the recording.

A CNN spokesman said Mr. Licht was also focused on expanding the network’s traditional TV viewership, describing his recommendations to producers as “editorial guidance” rather than “business strategy.” The spokesman said Mr. Licht had not yet put his stamp on the network’s programming, adding that Mr. Licht projects the network’s profits will increase in 2023.
Ratings are down from their Trump-era heights across cable news, but declines at CNN are particularly pronounced. The network has drawn an average of 639,000 people in prime time this quarter, according to data from Nielsen, a 27 percent decrease from a year ago. It trails MSNBC, which is down 23 percent in prime time during the same period, and Fox News, where viewership is up about 1 percent.
CNN has spent millions covering the war in Ukraine, two people familiar with its operations said, and the network is still paying some costs associated with CNN+, such as the salaries of high-profile journalists like Chris Wallace and Audie Cornish, which have also weighed on the bottom line.

The network is trying to defray costs associated with CNN+ by selling some of the programming created for the streaming service to other providers, including HBO Max, which Warner Bros. Discovery also owns.
Executives at CNN’s corporate parent are examining the media empire — which includes the Turner cable networks and channels like Food Network — to find roughly $3 billion in cost savings.
But Mr. Licht told employees at the town hall meeting in May that he didn’t expect Warner Bros. Discovery to impose additional layoffs at CNN after the shutdown of CNN+.
“No one has said to me, ‘You’re going to have to go cut this,’” Mr. Licht said, according to the recording. “I think there’s an acute understanding that they don’t know our business.”
The bulk of CNN’s revenue comes from long-term subscription deals with cable companies and from traditional TV advertising revenue, said Steve Cahall, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo. When those advertisers make spending decisions, they are concerned primarily with total audience size, Mr. Cahall said.
“If the strategy delivers more reach — that is, more ratings — then it’s probably a better business,” he said. “If it delivers less reach — if it turns out that the middle is a narrow place to be these days in America — then it’s a less good business strategy.”"
2022-08-03,"Richard Tait, an entrepreneur, business executive and venture capitalist who helped invent the board game Cranium, a familiar part of American family life in the late 1990s and 2000s, died on July 25 at his home in Bainbridge Island, Wash. He was 58.
His son Finn said the cause of death was complications of Covid-19.
In 1997, Richard Tait and his wife at the time, Karen Fries, were vacationing with another couple on Long Island, in the Hamptons, when someone suggested they play a board game. But they could not find a game everyone could enjoy. One couple dominated when they played Pictionary. The other won handily when they switched to Scrabble.
Then Mr. Tait had a thought: What if there was a game that let everyone play to their strengths? His friend Dan Katz, who won the Scrabble game that day, remembers Mr. Tait telling the room: “There has to be a way for everyone to feel comfortable.”
He soon designed a game that was part Pictionary, part Scrabble, part Trivial Pursuit and part Hangman. After sharing the idea with a colleague named Whit Alexander, the two expanded the game, adding mini-competitions that involved charades-like playacting, sculpting shapes from clay and humming popular songs.

“We knew it would not be enough to just ask questions about music,” Mr. Alexander said in an phone interview. “We needed activities that allowed people to show their musical intelligence.”

The result was Cranium. Over the next decade, with help from two novel means of distribution — Amazon.com and the Starbucks coffee shop chain — they sold more than 44 million copies of the game and its sister titles in 22 countries before their company was acquired by the game and toy giant Hasbro.
“Cranium was — I am going to say it — a game changer,” said Chris Byrne, who was part of the team that launched Pictionary and is now a game and toy consultant known as The Toy Guy. “It revolutionized game play — and the social aspects of game play — for much of a generation.”
Richard John Tait was born on Jan. 17, 1964, at his home in Broughty Ferry, Scotland, a village on the north bank of the River Tay as it flows into the North Sea. His father, Thomas, was an executive at the Polaroid camera and technology company. His mother, Kathleen, worked part time as a secretary and receptionist at medical offices in Broughty Ferry and later in Helensburgh, about 90 miles to the southwest, where the family moved in the 1970s.

Mr. Tait studied computer science as an undergraduate at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh before moving to the United States, where he earned a master’s degree at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. When he finished his M.B.A., he took a job with Microsoft, in the suburbs of Seattle, just as that software maker was growing into one of the world’s most powerful corporations. Not long after, he hired one of the company’s most notable employees: the future chief executive and chairman Satya Nadella.
In the 1990s, during the heyday of multimedia CD-ROMs, Mr. Tait oversaw Microsoft’s catalog of reference titles, including the Encarta encyclopedia and Bookshelf, a catchall collection spanning Roget’s Thesaurus, The American Heritage Dictionary, Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations and The Chicago Manual of Style. He eventually became a kind of entrepreneur-in-residence at the company, launching five new internet businesses inside Microsoft within four years, including Carpoint, a car-buying service, and Sidewalk, an online city guide.
He left the company in 1997, hoping to become a radio disc jockey on the strength of his Scottish brogue. But after a failed audition, he decided to develop Cranium, building a new company, Cranium Inc., with Mr. Alexander, a former Microsoft colleague.
When they finished creating the game in late 1998, game stores and other traditional retailers had already stocked their shelves for the holiday buying season. But one afternoon, when they met for coffee at a Starbucks in Seattle, Mr. Tait had another thought: What if they sold the game through the coffee shop chain?
“His idea was to sell the game not where games were sold but where our customers were,” Mr. Alexander said. “Most of the people we were going for would never set foot in a game store.”

Through an acquaintance, Mr. Tait arranged a meeting with Starbucks’s chief executive, Howard Schultz, and soon Starbucks was selling Cranium in shops across the country. Later, Mr. Tait and Mr. Alexander arranged similar deals with Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, both of which were then known for selling primarily books, not games.
“All successful games break the rules, and this one did, too,” Mr. Byrne said.
After the success of Cranium, their company released dozens of other games and toys, including the children’s games Cadoo and Cariboo. They sold the company to Hasbro for $77.5 million in 2008.
After the sale, Mr. Tait, a lifelong soccer fan, created a soccer-themed energy drink called Golazo — Spanish for “super goal” — but it did not find the same success as Cranium. He later became an entrepreneur-in-residence at Starbucks before joining the Seattle venture capital fund Valor Siren Ventures.
In addition to his son Finn, Mr. Tait is survived by another son, Deacon, and a daughter, Remy, all from his marriage to Ms. Fries, which ended in divorce; two sisters, Louise Tait and Gillian (Tait) Heard; his partner and fiancée, Amy Paron; and her daughter, Bella Paron.
As Mr. Tait envisioned Cranium, he began sketching pictures of the brain. He saw the game as a way of reaching both right-brained people (creative, intuitive types) and left-brained people (analytical, logical types).
That is why he called it Cranium. As the box said, it was “the game for your whole brain.”"
2022-08-04,"Sarah J. Maas — the “J” stands for Janet, you’re welcome — is a veteran world builder. Not only has she single-handedly created universes for her three best-selling fantasy series (including the Throne of Glass juggernaut, which just hit the children’s series list for its 50th week), Maas is also developing Court of Thorns and Roses for Hulu and has co-founded a human family in real life. Its youngest members and a mouthy dog were audible in the background of a phone interview in which the author talked about what it’s like to work in a writers' room after years of toiling alone.
“I decided I wanted to be heavily involved in the TV show adaptation process because it just seemed like a new creative mountain for me to climb,” Maas said. “It’s a whole different way of telling stories, bringing them to life, and a whole different way of seeing my characters.”
The logistics sound grueling. For four hours a day (including a scant 10-minute break), Maas meets several writers, a showrunner and Ron Moore, the creator of “Outlander” — “I’ve finally reached the point where I’m no longer calling him Mr. Moore,” she laughed — on Zoom. After that, she turns to edits for her third Crescent City novel. By 6:30 p.m., she’s putting her children to bed. By 7 p.m., Maas said, “I have my PJs on.” (Can you blame her?)
Although Maas still writes her books in Microsoft Word, she is dazzled by the “cool, intense” Disney technology that allows her team to lay out story cards and character arcs digitally. “It was a crash course,” she said. “My 90-year-old grandma is actually more tech savvy than I am.” In addition to the virtual whiteboard she uses with her team, Maas said, “I actually bought myself a physical whiteboard that I keep next to my desk so I can write things out and see it all in person, right in front of me. Which I’m sure makes me a bit of a dinosaur.”
So what’s it like to welcome outsiders to a realm that was born in her imagination? Maas enjoys getting to see her story through different sets of eyes and focusing on characters and story lines that might not necessarily be the ones she’d paid attention to in the past. When asked about the weirdest thing that’s happened in the writers’ room, Maas didn’t miss a beat: “Aside from my 4-year-old son running back and forth naked in the background?”

2022-08-05,"Turn on the evening news, and it immediately becomes clear that Americans are experiencing the effects of climate change. Extreme heat and drought are affecting tens of millions of people as floods and wildfires ravage communities from Appalachia to California. In the coming days, Congress has the opportunity to face the climate crisis while strengthening our country’s energy security, creating opportunities for businesses and improving the lives of Americans. We can’t afford to miss it.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may be the single most important piece of climate legislation in American history. It represents our best chance to build an energy future that is cleaner, cheaper and more secure. Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin of West Virginia deserve a lot of credit for reaching this agreement, as do countless others. Many business leaders and activists I’ve gotten to know through Breakthrough Energy, the climate organization I founded in 2015 to accelerate the clean energy transition, have worked relentlessly for decades for this moment. But although it appears the legislation will pass, success is not guaranteed, so it’s critical to keep pushing for it. Let me explain why.
Many of the technologies we’ll need to reach net-zero emissions don’t exist, are in early stages of development or are still too expensive to scale up. At the same time, more mature technologies like solar, wind and electric vehicles must be deployed more quickly in more places. Through new and expanded tax credits and a long-term approach, this bill would ensure that critical climate solutions have sustained support to develop into new industries.
A changing climate, a changing world
Card 1 of 4
Climate change around the world: In “Postcards From a World on Fire,” 193 stories from individual countries show how climate change is reshaping reality everywhere, from dying coral reefs in Fiji to disappearing oases in Morocco and far, far beyond.
The role of our leaders: Writing at the end of 2020, Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, found reasons for optimism in the Biden presidency, a feeling perhaps borne out by the passing of major climate legislation. That doesn’t mean there haven’t been criticisms. For example, Charles Harvey and Kurt House argue that subsidies for climate capture technology will ultimately be a waste.
The worst climate risks, mapped: In this feature, select a country, and we'll break down the climate hazards it faces. In the case of America, our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths.
What people can do: Justin Gillis and Hal Harvey describe the types of local activism that might be needed, while Saul Griffith points to how Australia shows the way on rooftop solar. Meanwhile, small changes at the office might be one good way to cut significant emissions, writes Carlos Gamarra.
These incentives would also provide the private sector with the confidence to invest for the long term. This legislation would begin to transform the parts of our economy that are hardest to decarbonize, like manufacturing, which we must do to reach net-zero emissions. As many Americans face summer blackouts, power shortages and high electricity bills, these measures would help build a modern, reliable power grid so all can have access to affordable, abundant and clean energy.

With those incentives and investments, this bill would catalyze a new era of American innovation. The ability of America’s universities and industries to innovate remains second to none, yet the country risks falling behind as other countries race to build their own clean energy economies. This legislation would help turn American energy innovations into American energy industries and unlock huge economic opportunities in the energy market. If it becomes law, few nations would have the capacity for producing homegrown clean energy like the United States. America could quickly become a leader in the deployment of clean energy at the scale required.
American businesses are ready for this change. I’ve spoken with corporate leaders who are eager for our government to act. Many have made big climate pledges and invested significant amounts in clean energy, both because they care about making good on their promises and because it’s good business. Even more businesses are waiting on the sidelines for a strong signal from government that clean industries are a solid long-term investment. Passing the Inflation Reduction Act would send that message and enable private capital to supercharge our clean energy future with even greater confidence.
With President Biden’s signature, this legislation would jump-start and support clean energy industries that could create millions of jobs, many in communities that have been built by fossil fuels. In fact, many of the most promising technologies in the clean energy economy will require similar skills and expertise possessed by today’s coal, oil and gas workers. This will help ensure a fair transition.
Solving climate change is perhaps the hardest challenge humanity has ever faced. It will require fundamentally transforming how we power our communities, move goods, build things, heat and cool buildings and grow food — basically how we do everything. We need to do it rapidly with a cohesive and coherent plan if we want to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

The country has an opportunity to set an example by offering a vision of what’s possible — and then by making it happen. By passing this legislation, Congress would mark a moment when, despite the many challenges facing the nation, lawmakers in Washington acted with ambition and foresight to build a cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous future. Let’s get it done.
Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, is also the founder of Breakthrough Energy and the author of “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”

2022-08-11,"ValueAct, an activist investor that has taken stakes in major companies including Microsoft, Reuters and 21st Century Fox, said on Thursday that it had bought nearly 7 percent of The New York Times Company’s common stock and would push for changes to some of the publisher’s business operations.
The purchase of the stock, made public in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, makes ValueAct one of the largest shareholders in The Times, alongside Vanguard and BlackRock Fund Advisors. The Times is controlled by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which limits the influence outside investors have on the company.
Shares of The Times, which are down about 27 percent year to date, jumped more than 10 percent on news of ValueAct’s investment, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
In a letter to its investors on Thursday, ValueAct said it had conducted research that showed many consumers were not aware that The Times sells a bundled subscription to its products, which include news, games, a cooking app and the sports publication The Athletic. ValueAct said that created a potential growth opportunity.

“This is an opportunity we believe management needs to drive with urgency, as it is the biggest lever to accelerate growth, deepen NYT’s competitive moat, and ensure the long-term strength and stability of the platform,” ValueAct said in the letter, according to a person with knowledge of its contents.
The Times has 9.17 million paid subscribers. It has a goal of signing up 15 million by the end of 2027.
The Times Company has a dual-class share structure. The shares used to elect the majority of the company’s board, called Class B, are controlled by a trust for the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which owns 95 percent of these shares. The family has controlled the business since Adolph Ochs purchased it in 1896. The 13-person board is chaired by A.G. Sulzberger, who is also the publisher of The Times.
Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said in a statement that members of the company’s management team had held conversations with ValueAct to exchange views.
“The board and management team will continue to make decisions that we believe are in the best interest of the company and all company shareholders,” Ms. Ha said in the statement.

Unlike some other activist investors — like Carl Icahn, who made a name for himself with bruising courtroom battles — ValueAct has a track record of investing in companies over a long period and working with management behind the scenes. Often it seeks out companies, like Adobe and Microsoft, that are in the middle of changing their business models.
Activist investors have been increasingly willing to take stakes in companies with dual-class structures like The Times. The activist firm Elliott Management revealed a position in the social media company Pinterest in August, and the activist firm Blackwells Capital pushed for the ouster of the chief executive of Peloton, John Foley, this spring.
The Times has dealt with activist investors before. In 2008, the hedge funds Harbinger Capital Partners and Firebrand Partners told the company they intended to nominate four independent directors to the publisher’s board. The Times ultimately struck a deal with the investment firms, offering up two board seats."
2022-08-12,"GREEN BAY, Wis. — It takes a certain type of Packers fan to tailgate outside Lambeau Field at sunrise months before the team’s season kicks off. But Tom Rozum isn’t an ordinary fan: He’s a Packers shareholder who last month was preparing to attend the team’s annual shareholder meeting, a rite unique to the N.F.L.’s only publicly owned team.
After Bloody Marys with family and friends, Rozum joined more than 8,000 other team shareholders in the stadium on a weekday morning last month to hear the Packers’ president, general manager and board members address the state of the fabled franchise.
“We can see where our money is going to,” joked Rozum, who lives nearby and circles the stadium daily to get to 10,000 steps. “Today, you can walk around like you own the place.”
Rozum’s shares, and those of the team’s other 539,000 shareholders, pay no dividends and cannot be traded. Their only benefits are a chance to buy shareholder-only swag and attending this two-hour annual meeting that is a cross between a dutiful accounting of the team, a pep rally and an inside joke.
Though largely worthless, the shares let fans dream that they have a voice in a team that plays in a league dominated by billionaire team owners. Many fans at the meeting viewed the Packers not as America’s Team, as the flashy Dallas Cowboys call themselves, but as Americana’s Team, a franchise that harkens back to when many N.F.L. teams were based in smaller factory towns and Vince Lombardi won championships by deploying a brand of smash-mouth football that’s no longer en vogue.
The reality is that the fans’ willingness to pay $300 for a frameable certificate helps the Packers compete with teams in far larger cities with deep-pocketed owners who can spend freely on bells and whistles such as top-rate facilities to lure the best free agents and stadiums to attract well-heeled fans."
2022-08-13,"Despite the rocky stock market and the slowing economy, corporate America is sending more money to shareholders than ever before.
The amounts are staggering, which is why these huge sums, sometimes called “windfall profits,” have become a political target.
The landmark climate and tax legislation that now goes to President Biden for his signature includes a new 1 percent tax on buybacks, for example.
Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and Senate majority leader, announced the new tax with a succinct critique. “I hate stock buybacks,” he said. “I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.”

Yet buybacks and dividends are immensely important to investors.
Consider that companies in the S&P 500 will spend more than $500 billion on dividends this year and more than $1 trillion on share buybacks, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s a combined $1.5 trillion, more than ever before.
No wonder these enormous cash flows are capturing attention.
As investors, consumers or just plain citizens of the planet, it’s worth considering the significance of buybacks and dividends — whether they are a form of self-serving corporate profligacy, a wise use of capital or perhaps something in between, as Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, suggests.
“It’s really a matter of price and value,” he said in an interview. “Returning cash to investors is a good thing, if the company doesn’t have a better use for it. It’s a bad thing if it’s done in a way that destroys shareholder value. It’s all in the numbers.”
Windfalls vs. steady profits
Windfall profits from energy companies have been bolstering the buyout and dividend totals.
ConocoPhillips announced earlier this month that, thanks to a special dividend, it was making “a $5 billion increase in planned 2022 return of capital to $15 billion.” EOG Resources made a similar move — declaring a special dividend of $1.50 per share, twice its regular quarterly dividend. And Exxon Mobil said that while it was maintaining its dividend, it would spend $30 billion on buybacks, tripling the previous total.
From a classic economic standpoint, the large profits by energy companies this year are just what you would expect from a sudden shock to overall supply — caused in large part by Russia’s war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. Companies that extract, refine and distribute oil and gas have been making a ton of money. While the S&P 500 has declined this year, energy companies have gained more than 40 percent, according to FactSet, far more than any other sector.

A moral dilemma
If you hold shares in a broad stock index fund, you own a piece of these companies, and they have been bolstering your own returns. In financial terms, that’s a wonderful thing.
But is it immoral?
The secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, says it is. “It is immoral for oil and gas companies to be making record profits from this energy crisis on the backs of the poorest people and communities and at a massive cost to the climate,” Mr. Guterres told reporters at the U.N. headquarters in New York on Aug. 3.  
In a similar vein, President Biden said in June: “Exxon made more money than God this year,” and criticized the company for its plans to spend the $30 billion in stock buybacks, rather than in capital investment for oil drilling. The company says that it is doing both, and that buybacks are good for investors.
All of these companies are subject to government and shareholder pressure to transition toward greener fuels — appropriately so, in my view. And many should be moving much faster. But the world still needs the energy they are selling, so they and their shareholders are profiting.
Consider the American firms that were so flush with cash that they led the market in stock buybacks over the 12 months through June. Not one was an energy company. The leader, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, was Apple, with $91.3 billion in buybacks. Other top buyback companies were Alphabet (parent company of Google), Meta Platforms (which owns Facebook), Microsoft and Bank of America.

Dividend returns
Modern dividend-paying companies are sometimes viewed as Steady Eddies — reliable providers of steady income.
Caterpillar, Clorox, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive and T. Rowe Price, as well as Chevron and Exxon, have been among them.
“When the markets are rising 20 percent a year, people tend to forget about dividends,” John Linehan, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price equity income fund, said in an interview. “But the longer your investment horizon, the more important dividends are for you.”

That’s evident in the returns calculated by Mr. Silverblatt. While the average yield for the S&P 500 from 1926 through June was 3.5 percent — about double what it is today — as a result of compounding, dividends accounted for 38.2 percent of the index’s total return, by his reckoning.
Measuring the effects of buybacks is trickier. It’s often said that repurchases increase share value by reducing the number of shares, thereby increasing earnings per share. It’s also said that buybacks are responsible for much of the upward movements of the stock market recently. The evidence is more complicated, however.
An unintended consequence
“Not widely known is that for many years after the Great Crash of 1929, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) viewed buybacks as bordering on criminal activity,” Edward Yardeni and Joseph Abbott, of the independent firm Yardeni Research, wrote in their book, “Stock Buybacks: The True Story.”
The authors say the growth of buybacks is partly an unintended consequence of a change in the tax code in 1993 under President Bill Clinton that put a $1 million cap on chief executives’ salaries. Ever inventive, corporations accelerated the issuance of stock options and grants as a form of executive compensation.
As The New York Times has documented over many years, such grants have widened a pay gap with rank-and-file employees, creating billionaires in the executive suite.

When stock is issued this way to corporate executives and ordinary employees, the stake of existing shareholders is diluted. Say, for example, you own 1 out of 100 shares in a small company. After 10 new shares are issued to company employees, you will own only 1/110th of the company.
But the company remedies that dilution with buybacks. That prevents the value of your shares from declining. When the buybacks are greater — reducing the total shares to, say, 90 — the value of your shares increases.
A study by Citi Research found that S&P 500 companies made $882 billion in total buybacks last year, but after taking care of share dilution, just $620 billion in buybacks were left. Only that portion can reasonably be described as returning value to shareholders.
The effects of share repurchases on stock prices are ambiguous. Stocks in the S&P 500 index with the greatest buybacks outperformed the overall S&P 500 over the 10 years through July, but underperformed the overall S&P 500 over five years. If these purchases are indeed goosing stock returns, the numbers don’t show it conclusively.
When money can be reinvested more productively by a company, shareholders are better off without dividends or buybacks.

Warren Buffett has explained this to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. “Our shareholders are far wealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for acquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends,” he wrote in his 2012 letter to shareholders.
While he buys shares of dividend-paying companies for Berkshire, Berkshire itself doesn’t pay any dividends because he says he can invest the money better himself. Berkshire does buy back shares — it has been doing so lately — when Mr. Buffett deems the price a good bargain. Buying shares when they are priced too high destroys value.
This is core financial theory. There is art in making practical decisions that don’t merely enrich corporate executives.
From this perspective, when windfalls aren’t accompanied by attractive opportunities for corporate reinvestment, buybacks or special dividends are an excellent use of company cash.
The new 1 percent tax could shift some corporate spending from buybacks to dividends, Mr. Ma said. But between them, dividends and buybacks will remain important ways for companies return profits to shareholders.

Whether that money arrives steadily or as windfalls may matter a great deal if you need to draw on it now.
But, fundamentally, the ability of companies to generate a torrent of cash is what matters. As long as there is a lot of it, and it compounds over long periods, you will prosper.
Windfall profits? Let’s have more of them, as frequently as possible."
2022-08-14,"The top job in this country has gone from the baby boomer Barack Obama to the barely boomer Donald Trump to the throwback Joe Biden, a member of the so-called Silent Generation. At this rate, the presidency may do the natural thing and skip over Generation X entirely.
Wait, you may be asking yourself: Gen Xers are supposed to be in charge now?
It may not seem like it, but do the math: Born between the years 1965 and 1980, Gen Xers are now between the ages of 42 and 57, prime time for being the boss, whether of country, corporation or just a small sales team.
And yet after years of being outnumbered in the work force by boomers (born between 1946 and 1964), Gen Xers have already been overtaken by another, larger cohort: millennials (born between 1981 and 1996). According to a Pew analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, Gen Xers were a majority of the U.S. work force for only a few years — a brief period of dominance ending in 2016.
If Gen Xers are the bosses now, they are the bosses only in a very Gen X way: ambivalently, fleetingly and with dubious authority.

Here’s a refresher on the measliness of Generation X: Our parents were typically members of the Silent Generation, that cohort born between 1928 and 1945 — people shaped by the Great Depression and World War II, people who didn’t get to choose what they were having for dinner and made sure their kids didn’t either. The parents of Gen X believed in spanking and borderline benign neglect, in contrast to the boisterous boomers and their deluxe offspring, the millennial horde.

Grubby Gen Xers were designated the O.G. slackers, which did not bode well for becoming the bosses of the future. It wasn’t our fault! I mean, mostly not. Reality bit for Gen X because when we started to join the work force around 1990, the economy was in a recession; the recovery that followed was sluggish."

2022-08-16,"KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian energy agency responsible for the oversight and safe operation of the nation’s nuclear power plants said on Tuesday night that Russian hackers had launched their most ambitious effort yet on the company’s official website.
The attack appeared to fail and there was no indication that it threatened to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid or the company’s oversight of the nation’s 15 working nuclear reactors.
The company, Energoatom, said it had managed to keep the attack from being visible to users of the website. Even so, it was a reminder of the digital threat posed to the power infrastructure in Ukraine, where the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has stirred global alarm.
Ukraine’s power grid has been knocked offline twice before, in 2015 and 2016, causing widespread blackouts, and Russian efforts to attack the Energoatom site were being closely watched in case they presaged a larger event.

The large-scale cyberattacks — like knocking out Ukraine’s power grid or frying cellular service — that Western intelligence officials worried would accompany the Russian invasion in February have failed to materialize. But Russia has used hacking campaigns to support its ground campaign, pairing malware with missiles in several attacks, including on TV stations and government agencies, according to a report released in April by Microsoft.
Ukrainian officials said this spring that they had thwarted a cyberattack on Ukraine’s power grid that could have knocked out power to two million people, raising fears that Moscow was continuing to persist in its digital efforts to advance its military campaign.
Daily shelling at the Zaporizhzhia complex — Europe’s largest nuclear power plant — has sparked international concerns about the possibility of a meltdown. The United Nations has offered to help send nuclear inspectors to the site, which is occupied by Russian forces but being operated by Ukrainian workers, if both sides agree.
It remains unclear who is to blame for the shelling. The Ukrainians have accused the Russians of directing strikes there to cut off energy supplies to other cities, while the Russians say Ukraine is responsible for the attacks.
On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine spoke by telephone about safety threats at the Zaporizhzhia plant. According to a statement from Mr. Macron’s office, the French president stressed his concern about the impact of “ongoing clashes on the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities” and called for the withdrawal of Russian forces.

Odesa Is Defiant. It’s Also Putin’s Ultimate Target.

Aug. 19, 2022
ODESA, Ukraine — The Odesa Fine Arts Museum, a colonnaded early-19th-century palace, stands almost empty. Early in Russia’s war on Ukraine, its staff removed more than 12,000 works for safe keeping. One large portrait remained, depicting Catherine the Great, the Russian empress and founder of Odesa, as a just and victorious goddess.
Seen from below in Dmitry Levitzky’s painting, the empress is a towering figure in a pale gown with a golden train. The ships behind her symbolize Russia’s victory over the Ottoman Turks in 1792. “She’s textbook Russian imperial propaganda,” said Gera Grudev, a curator. “The painting’s too large to move, and besides, leaving it shows the Russian occupiers we don’t care.”
The decision to let Catherine’s portrait hang in isolation in the first room of the shuttered museum reflects a sly Odesan bravura: an empress left to contemplate how the brutality of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president who likens himself to a latter-day czar, has alienated the largely Russian-speaking population of this Black Sea port, established by her in 1794 as Moscow’s long-coveted conduit from the steppe to the Mediterranean.

2022-08-22,"ATHENS — “I’m committed,” Kyriakos Mitsotakis told an audience of industrialists and entrepreneurs in April 2018, to “a government of the truly best people.” Under his leadership, the vices of the past — nepotism, corruption — would no longer be tolerated. Greece, he announced on the day he became prime minister in July 2019, could “proudly raise its head again.”
Three years later, many outsiders have been convinced of the reformation. Microsoft, Pfizer and JPMorgan Chase have set up offices in the country, a streamlined visa program has incentivized thousands of digital nomads to relocate to Athens, and a relentless tourism push — “You will want to stay forever!” runs the tagline — has lured a record number of Americans to the Aegean this summer. Even the European Union’s supervision of the economy is coming to a close. After a decade of difficulties, the country has seemingly undergone a stunning transformation.
But within Greece, a darker reality festers. The corruption and conflicts of interests Mr. Mitsotakis pledged to root out not only still exist but also, in many respects, appear to have concentrated and deepened. Far from having been overhauled, the Greek state has received only a cosmetic makeover, a managerial window dressing. In recent weeks, a wiretapping scandal has sensationally unveiled the underlying rot. Labeled Greece’s Watergate, it has exposed the rank surveillance beneath the glittering surface. The “Greece 2.0” Mr. Mitsotakis promised, it turns out, is just more of the same.
The scandal started with Thanasis Koukakis, a financial journalist known for his investigation of powerful banking figures. In June 2020 the Greek intelligence services put him under surveillance — tapping both his phones — on the grounds that he posed a threat to national security. Two months later, Mr. Koukakis, tipped off to the wiretap, confronted the authorities. His surveillance stopped that day.

That seemed to be the end of it. Then in July of last year, he received a text message from an unknown number. “Thanasis, do you know about this?” read the message in Greek, followed by a link, which he clicked on. It proceeded to infect his iPhone with Predator, malicious spyware that whisked his data away to a mysterious Cyprus-registered, Athens-based firm called Intellexa.

He’s not the only Greek to have received such a message. In September of last year, Nikos Androulakis — a member of the European Parliament and then the leading candidate to take over Pasok, Greece’s center-left party and a historic rival of Mr. Mitsotakis’s party — was sent the same link. He did not click on it. Only days earlier, for reasons the government has yet to adequately explain, he was put under legal surveillance by Greek intelligence services."
2022-08-23,"VANCOUVER — The newest players in Vancouver’s never-ending real estate drama don’t come from across the Pacific or from south of the border. They are the area’s oldest inhabitants, ensconced in this corner of Canada since long before what they call “contact” with European colonizers — and they had long been bystanders as a hyperactive market created fortunes and turned the city into the country’s priciest.
Vancouver’s three local Indigenous communities, called First Nations in Canada, now find themselves in an unusual position. As owners of vast tracts of prime land in a major metropolis, they are courted by developers and poised to continue shaping a city that has been transformed in recent decades by money from Hong Kong and mainland China.
“In the past, we were looking in windows just to be a part of things — we’re now at the table,’’ said Wilson Williams, a councilor and spokesman for the Squamish Nation, which broke ground this month on an 11-tower, 6,000-unit residential project called Senakw on 11 acres across English Bay from downtown Vancouver.

How the Squamish, as well as the Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh nations, got to the table is the result of decades-long legal battles and a tentative union among the three communities over competing land claims. It is also part of the ongoing process of national reckoning and reconciliation over the brutal treatment of Canada’s Indigenous population, which was highlighted again last month by Pope Francis’s apology for his church’s role in that history.

Like their counterparts in the rest of North America, the city’s three Indigenous communities, who altogether number about 7,500 people, were dispossessed of their ancestral lands. But there was a key difference: the authorities in British Columbia never bothered to sign treaties in exchange for most of the Indigenous-held territories.
“The British governor came here and just started taking land away and giving it to his friends without any kind of agreement with local nations,’’ Kennedy Stewart, the mayor of Vancouver, said in an interview. “If you’re applying English common law, you can’t just take people’s land without authority, and so that really set the groundwork for everything.”
British settlers starting taking land from Indigenous communities in Vancouver, beginning in the 1880s and through the 1920s. Now, following decades of court battles, governments have returned or sold back land to the three communities — who have now become, according to the mayor, the “largest developable landowner in this city and probably in the metro area.”
The First Nations have also been given preference as the federal or provincial governments have sold off land they no longer use, including a former military site and the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, where the First Nations are building two new developments.

The First Nations have financed land purchases through loans from the federal government or from banks, sometimes in partnership with private developers eager to build on some of the last swaths of prime land in Vancouver.

Ian Gillespie, the founder and chief executive of Westbank, a major developer involved in Senakw and other Indigenous projects, said that the developments were much more than a real estate story, but one about achieving true reconciliation through the three nations’ acquisition of power.
“Reconciliation isn’t about recognizing what happened and saying, ‘That’s terrible, I’m sorry, let’s move on,’’ Mr. Gillespie said, adding that things will change only when Indigenous communities get power. “Power can come in different forms, but economic power is probably top of the list.’’
“When it comes to real estate in Greater Vancouver, it’s our Microsoft, our Tesla,’’ added Mr. Gillespie, who is not Indigenous. “And so if you can put the First Nations at the center of that, then they are in a position of power.’’

Besides the Squamish-led project called Senakw, the Musqueam Nation has already built about 40 percent of a 1,250-unit development on 21 acres near the University of British Columbia. Called Lelem, its public spaces feature Musqueam art and designs.

But the two projects will be dwarfed by one to develop 90 acres of one of Canada’s most valuable oceanview pieces of property, known as Jericho Lands in West Point Grey, a wealthy neighborhood with beaches and mountain views. The three Indigenous communities are developing Jericho, a former military enclave, together after buying back federal and provincial land under a jointly-owned company formed in 2014, MST Development.
In all, the three communities separately or together have acquired about 175 acres in metro Vancouver in the past eight years, said David Negrin, the chief executive of MST. They are currently negotiating to acquire about a further 100 acres of land on 14 sites from the provincial government and two from the federal government in metro Vancouver, Mr. Negrin added.
“If you look at the land they’ve got back, it’s nothing compared to the land they had,’’ said Mr. Negrin, a high-profile developer hired by the three communities to run MST.

While the communities must now mostly purchase back land they once owned, paying market rates, leaders are pressing for a simple return as another step toward true reconciliation.
“The nations are moving in that direction now, that they’d like to get more of their land back and not pay for it,’’ Mr. Negrin said.

Only in Vancouver have Indigenous communities had so much success.
Across Canada, Indigenous communities have land claims in many other major cities, said Ginger Gosnell-Myers, a former urban and Indigenous planning expert with the Vancouver city government and now a fellow at Simon Fraser University.
“Cities everywhere in this country had First Nation villages that settlers came and stole,’’ said Ms. Gosnell-Myers, a member of the Nisga’a and Kwakwaka’wakw nations. “We don’t have cities across this country by divine intervention. They are there because they were the easiest places to occupy.’’

Outside Vancouver, few Indigenous communities have succeeded in reclaiming a major piece of city land — in great part because of competing claims by different communities over the same territory, Ms. Gosnell-Myers said.
“Other First Nations with overlapping land claims are not working together, but Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh are, and this is making them unstoppable,’’ she said.
Unity among the three nations took decades to achieve, and they still don’t take it for granted. In fact, claims by the Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh over the 11 acres now being developed by the Squamish contributed to the delay of a final court ruling.
According to First Nation leaders, unity emerged in the past decade following a series of unexpected events.
The three communities, along with the Lil’Wat in Whistler, realized the value of working together in helping host the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

“That’s when the conversations started,’’ said Mr. Williams, the Squamish councilor whose ancestral name is Sxwíxwtn. “Why the four nations? Because the Olympics are on our land, and we were able to put politics aside to be able to work with everyone.’’

Around the same time, members of the three Vancouver communities came together at an emotional funeral for a baby with family ties to all three nations, said Wayne Sparrow, the chief of the Musqueam Nation.
In a series of meetings at the Musqueam longhouse, leaders from the three communities worked through key differences over land. Traditionally, besides family ties, the three communities engaged in cultural and sports activities, and came together at weddings or funerals.
“But when it came to the land, there were always disputes,’’ said Matthew Thomas, economic development officer of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation.

After some “arm-twisting,’’ the three communities agreed to work together on some parcels of land, including the 90-acre Jericho, Mr. Thomas said.
They left unsettled the ownership of other pieces of land.

“So there’s still a lot of work that needs to get done,’’ Chief Sparrow said. “It’s not as rosy as everybody thinks it is.’’
Still, the tentative union allowed the creation in 2014 of MST Development and the purchase of 52 acres of the Jericho Lands, in co-ownership with Canada Lands, the federal government’s real estate arm. MST then purchased 38 acres from the province on its own. It also signaled that the three communities were now a force to reckon with in real estate.
“I got a lot of knocks on the door in the last four years, especially with the profile of MST taking shape,’’ said Stephen Lee, the chief executive officer of Musqueam Capital Corporation, the First Nation’s business arm.

For Indigenous leaders, used to being “out of sight, out of mind’’ in Vancouver, the developments gave them “a sense of being at the table in the past couple of years,” Mr. Williams said.
Vancouver Magazine placed the three communities at the very top of its list of 50 top power brokers early this year, pointing out that the City Council agreed to rename a street — named after the province’s first lieutenant governor whose racist policies harmed the city’s original inhabitants — following a request by the Musqueam.
Some Indigenous leaders said that this newly acquired power was difficult to grasp because their communities had yet to reap the benefits. Chief Sparrow said that perceptions of the communities had begun to change, in part thanks to the magazine ranking.
“It’s very helpful, being recognized to have that amount of power, especially with business,’’ Chief Sparrow said. “Big business people in Vancouver kind of looked and didn’t really acknowledge First Nations. Now, while the government has the legal obligation to consult and accommodate First Nations, I think the business world is getting to that stage.’’"

To the Editor:
Re “Townhouses? A Rich Town in Tech Says Nope” (Business, Aug. 15):
Your report about NIMBYism in Atherton, Calif., puts the megawealthy’s hypocrisy on full display. Tech leaders and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley need to walk the walk when it comes to addressing the region’s housing crisis.
While we have many recent examples of tech companies like Cisco, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and LinkedIn taking bold steps to fund affordable housing in our region, we must also guarantee that each of our cities and towns, particularly our most exclusive ones, create affordable homes for all.
A recent study shows that while the Bay Area needs to build nearly 30,000 affordable housing units for low-income families to keep up with the demand, only 3,645 permits for such units have been issued.
So, instead of saying “not in my backyard,” I would urge the residents of Atherton to reconsider.
Open your hearts and the gates to your world. Your influence stretches beyond the charitable gifts you make. Say “yes” to affordable, multifamily housing. In your backyard, too.

To the Editor:
To our friends in Atherton, Calif.: You are missing the forest for the trees that you want to save. (OK, it’s a joke.) You have the unique opportunity to do something good, something bold, something important. You can support hard-working families — good people who want to help build our country and make your city run right — by building much-needed housing in your wonderful community.
You are missing the great good that can come from all this. You will be the loser if you stop new housing from being built, because you could be exposed to different kinds of people — learn their hopes, their fears, their goals.
This could be a great learning experience for you. There is no reason to be afraid of new tenants in your community. I am sure it would enrich and inform your view of the world. Who wants to associate with everybody who is the same — same houses, same work, same food, same ideas, same everything?

Re “Workers in the Catskills Can’t Find Places to Live” (Real Estate, Aug. 21):
The struggle to find affordable (and available!) housing in the Hudson Valley is a problem for white-collar workers too. It’s really tough, for instance, for incoming assistant professors at SUNY New Paltz to afford housing on their salaries, which start at around $60,000. That affects whom the college can recruit and retain. In that way, the lack of affordable housing threatens one of the county’s anchor institutions — one that plays an important role in the region’s economy, character and community.

Re “In Ukraine War, a Nuclear Plant Is Held Hostage” (front page, Aug. 24):
By invading a sovereign nation and then using its most volatile asset as a defensive bulwark, Russia is revealing yet again why we need to think very carefully before embracing nuclear power as part of a global arsenal to combat climate change.
The Chernobyl disaster demonstrated nearly 40 years ago that, even in peaceful times, poorly designed and badly managed nuclear power can go tragically awry. Other nuclear accidents and near misses in the U.S. and abroad should have given us ample cause to sideline nuclear as a pathway to clean energy.

But Russia this time is not just mismanaging the Zaporizhzhia power plant; it is intentionally placing this giant facility — the largest in Europe — at the center of an existential battle over Ukraine sovereignty. Its nuclear brinkmanship reminds us that this technology, by its very existence, can be a powerful wartime weapon.
We have long been concerned that nuclear plants could be targets for terrorism — a concern that was heightened when we learned that Al Qaeda included U.S. nuclear plants as potential targets for terrorism. Russia’s actions bring a cynical new twist to nuclear power’s vulnerability in an unstable world.

Re “Democrat Pat Ryan Wins in House Race That Turned on Abortion” (nytimes.com, Aug. 24):
The victory by the Democratic candidate, Pat Ryan, over Mark Molinaro, a Republican, in the Hudson Valley’s 19th Congressional District race was more than just a referendum on the political power of abortion rights. As Mr. Ryan said on Twitter after he was declared the winner, freedom and choice were on the ballot.
Although Americans hold wildly differing views on policy, the economy and the role of government itself, the overwhelming majority are deeply committed to basic fundamentals of individual liberty and choice. Mr. Ryan’s victory signals that voters are deeply troubled by the G.O.P.’s flagrant embrace of a society where state governments not only prohibit women from making choices about their bodies, but also criminalize those who violate their edicts.

Re “Daniel Goldman, Ex-Trump Prosecutor, Tops Crowded Field in N.Y. Primary” (nytimes.com, Aug. 24):
I live in the newly configured 10th Congressional District in New York, and after working the polls I feel deeply dispirited. For 15 hours, poll workers served a dribble of voters in this supposedly politically engaged community.
Dan Goldman, who won a plurality — 16,686 votes, or 26 percent of the votes, versus 24 percent for his nearest rival, Yuh-Line Niou (as of this writing) — will likely become our representative in November in this heavily Democratic district.
Ms. Niou and Mondaire Jones, who came in third, together earned 27,157 votes, or 41.9 percent of the votes. The low voter turnout that I believe led to Mr. Goldman’s victory reflects that voters don’t care enough to fill out an absentee ballot before leaving for vacation. Maybe folks thought: It’s only the primary. But given the demographics, our next congressman will likely have been chosen by only 3.5 percent of the 474,320 registered voters in the district.
Yes, passivity is a choice. Blame summer, blame the courts, blame ourselves. There were real differences between the candidates — in experience, focus, ethnicity. But, hey, we’re playing pickleball.

Re “Doctors Finding Abortion Bans Hard to Decode” (front page, Aug. 20):
Legislators in Louisiana have ignored one of the most consequential fallouts from anti-abortion laws. As physicians, we take an oath to offer our patients the care that is in their best interest. We hold that oath to be sacred. OB-GYNs are now conflicted between offering a woman the care that is in her best interest versus withholding that care for fear of prosecution or loss of license.
Faced with these egregious limitations, newly trained OB-GYNs may think twice about coming to Louisiana to establish their practice.

Senator Ted Cruz has warned that Democrats’ new spending law will create a “shadow army of 87,000 I.R.S. agents.” Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for Arizona governor, tied the increase in agents to the F.B.I. search of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home and warned, “Not a single one of us is safe.” Across social media, conservatives have embraced falsehoods about armed agents, saying that they will target Republicans in particular.
Why are the I.R.S. provisions in the law — $80 billion in additional funding for the agency over the next decade — getting so much attention?
In part, Republicans recognize that the law’s biggest elements, money for climate and health care, are popular. So they’re seeking other ways to criticize the legislation, including through conspiracy theories about the agency, as The Times has reported.
The opposition is also part of an older ideological debate. Republican lawmakers tend to favor lower taxes, particularly for wealthy Americans. They have achieved that by cutting tax rates. But they have also done it by blocking more funding for the I.R.S. — in an effort to stop the agency from aggressively collecting taxes.
“Among Republicans, there’s been a lot of hostility toward the I.R.S. for years,” Alan Rappeport, who covers economic policy for The Times, told me. “The funding has revved that up.”
The agency funding is meant to help it investigate wealthy tax cheats, improve customer service and modernize systems. By empowering the agency to collect the money it’s owed, the changes are projected to raise about $100 billion in net tax revenue over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That money will help pay for the rest of the Democrats’ new law."

2022-08-28,"Colleen McCreary recently gave managers at Credit Karma a message that could seem more apt for rising sixth graders than personal finance executives.
“Back to school is coming,” Ms. McCreary, the company’s chief people officer, recalled telling managers. “We’re getting excited about all of these returning-in-the-fall type activities.”
The company has been trying to get employees back to the office regularly for more than a year. First, the vaccine rollout gave executives hope that the office would be full again. Then there was “Wine Down Wednesday” in the company’s Charlotte, N.C., location, and kombucha by the firepit in the Oakland, Calif., building. Now Credit Karma’s leaders are relying on a different incentive: Labor Day. The latest corporate magical thinking is that September will herald the grand refilling of cubicles around the country.
Each pandemic fall has brought with it employers’ hopes of a broad-scale return to the office. Last year’s plans were derailed by the Delta variant. But this time, business leaders are adamant that they won’t change course. Seriously.

“I don’t like to take attendance or babysit, but managers should know where their people are,” Ms. McCreary said, adding that since February employees have been asked to come in at least a few days a week, though the number is not specified and different teams set their own guidelines‌.

It’s been more than two years since the rules of the working world snapped. On all sides of the debate over returning to the office, the stakes feel high as ever. More than one-third of U.S. workers who can do their jobs from home want to stay permanently remote, according to recent data from Gallup. Meanwhile, executives realize that if they don’t persuade their employees to come back now, with pandemic restrictions eased in most areas, the new norms of flexible work will be hard to unstick. So, some sense a standoff coming. Bosses say the office deadlines are real; workers are testing just how much they mean that.
“Many leaders have had decades of experience having all the answers,” said Sheela Subramanian, vice president of Future Forum, a Slack-backed research consortium. “That’s why you’re seeing a lot of these top down mandates of ‘you will do this,’ and the inevitable resistance to that.”
“I have seen an increased resolve among executives to figure out what’s next,” she added.
It’s either the end of an era of mute button fails, hybrid hiccups and making it up as we go along — or the beginning of outright rebellion.

“I don’t think there will be a big grand return to office,” said Christine Ratcliff, who works in online education and lives in Littleton, Colo. “It seems like a trickle.”
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
Ms. Ratcliff switched jobs last year and applied only for roles that would let her stay fully remote. She considers herself a night owl and bristles at the thought of a position requiring her to be alert early in the day. She feels comfortable at the desk in her one-bedroom apartment, seated under a whiteboard on which she has scrawled affirmations like “routine, not schedule.”
“I could see one company being like, ‘OK, today is the day we’re doing it, if we lose people we lose people,’” Ms. Ratcliff continued. “But in the culture as a whole it’s probably going to be a constant struggle.”
Some major companies brought workers back to the office in recent months, as the winter’s Omicron wave ebbed, including American Express, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs. But during the summer, workers took long-delayed vacations or worked from home more often, making offices feel ghostly quiet. Earlier this year, office attendance on Fridays was at 30 percent, far lower than it was on Wednesdays at 46 percent, according to data from Kastle.

People were working remotely about 35 percent of the time this spring, according to a national survey from Stanford and other institutions. That is more than employers had expected. The same survey found that companies had planned for their employees to be remote just 30 percent of the time by 2022.
In general, it’s been a period of surprises for business leaders — who are sometimes realizing they don’t know where their employees are working, even if they know it isn’t the office.
“One organization I spoke to had employees update their mailing address because they were sending out sweatshirts,” said Steve Black, chief strategy officer at the H.R. technology company Topia. “They found people in random places around the globe.”
“There’s been a little bit of ostrich burying its head in the sand, a bit of ‘we’re trying to keep people safe and do our best,’” he added. “We’re starting to see folks formalize their policies.”

A number of companies, including Apple, Capital One, Comcast and The New York Times Company, are setting fresh guidelines around returning to the office for September.
For many workers, a fresh push from bosses means new forms of pushback. Chris Campbell, who manages a team at an advertising agency in Minneapolis, has been required to go into the office one day a week since May. This summer, executives at his agency have been discussing ramping up the return to office to two days a week, while Mr. Campbell keeps emphasizing how much he has gained from the freedoms of remote work.
“You’re able to be so much more present with your child and your partner,” he said. “And your dog.” (His is named Frida, a German wirehaired pointer with bushy brows.)
Mr. Campbell has assured his own direct reports they shouldn’t feel pressured to commute in, and gave two permission to leave Minneapolis and go permanently remote. “People are going to resist it pretty heavily,” he said broadly of return to office plans. “But it’s a pretty uphill battle.”
At Credit Karma, which has more than 1,500 employees, company leaders have persistently faced resistance on returning to the office. During several full-staff video meetings in 2020, Ms. McCreary recalled, leaders spent nearly all their time fielding questions about remote work. Much of the opposition she heard came from workers who said they were productive at home, found it easier to have a personal life with remote work and saw some competitors take the leap to permanent flexibility. The company terminated two employees for working in locations where the business isn’t authorized to operate.

“It’s always, ‘Google is doing XYZ,’ or ‘Facebook is doing XYZ,’ or ‘Small start-up down the street is doing XYZ,’ why can’t we?” Ms. McCreary said. “We’re very clear this is the choice we’ve made, and if people want to make another choice there are lots of opportunities for people from Credit Karma to go work somewhere else.”

Some Credit Karma employees have embraced the company’s approach on returning to the office, which sets the expectation that they work in person but allows them to pick which days. Patrick Kennedy, 28, a growth technology manager, joined the firm in February after leaving his previous job at a cable company because he had to work in person on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. He said he often couldn’t get an exemption to stay home when last-minute child care obligations arose, while at Credit Karma he has more flexibility.
Mr. Kennedy now goes into the office frequently because he feels energized by his morning routine of bopping desk to desk, trash-talking his office Ping-Pong opponents and finding colleagues who share his “Stranger Things” obsession.
“I’ll get someone on my team, we’ll stop and see Scotty who hired me, we’ll take the elevator to the eighth floor to say hi, chitchat,” Mr. Kennedy said. “I’m eager to get to work just because when something happens, I have to inform them of my own personal life gossip.”

At many companies, including Credit Karma, leaders have felt a growing sense of urgency to make their work arrangements more concrete, given the logistical bumps in that hazy middle ground between fully remote and fully in-person work. A recent survey of human resources professionals showed that 39 percent had found an employee working in a location where their business didn’t have tax approval to operate.

Comcast and NBCUniversal are shifting into a newly detailed return-to-office plan in September, in which U.S. office-based employees are asked to be in person on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Previously, management asked employees to be in the office several days a week but didn’t specify which days, and some were finding it challenging to see their teammates.
At Apple, some employees recently circulated a petition demanding the option to keep working remotely after Labor Day: “This uniform mandate from senior leadership does not consider the unique demands of each job role nor the diversity of individuals,” members of the group Apple Together wrote.
Apple declined to comment on the petition.
Beyond the white-collar work force, which is centered in larger cities where people have longer commutes, a lot of people are working in person. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that last month just 7 percent of Americans worked from home at some point because of Covid. Researchers point out, though, that this figure underestimates the extent of remote work. The survey asks people whether they are working from home because of Covid. But more and more people are working from home not because of Covid, but because of the way the pandemic reshaped the norms of work.

Zoe Sands, who works at a financial services firm in Denver doing internal audits, learned that management wanted her to start coming in once a week starting in May. Then she heard the company is hoping to build up to three days a week by later this year. She has decided that she would try to negotiate with her manager if she is asked to come in more than two days.
Ms. Sands feels most at ease when she can wake up at 7:15 a.m., drink a Yerba Mate and immediately start answering emails without devoting time to doing her hair and makeup. Going into the office means spending part of her morning rooting through her closet looking for an outfit that doesn’t make her feel self-conscious.
“One day I was really stressed out because I couldn’t find anything to wear,” she said. “I was like, that’s a really dumb way to call in and not go to the office, because I’m having a wardrobe malfunction.”
But the strain of trying to remake lives and routines is far from trivial. In conversations with more than three dozen people, it is clear that many can’t picture squeezing themselves back into office life with all its constraints, from the discomfort of blazers to the sting of a hallway slight. Others are increasingly desperate to return to the version of working life that existed before the pandemic and can’t imagine entirely letting go of their in-person relationships.

As summer fades, people are increasing attempts to articulate those workplace needs. Mr. Campbell, for example, said he has been raising concerns about returning to the office with his managers, emphasizing the prospect of the company losing out on talent because its competitors are embracing more flexibility.
Mr. Campbell has listened to his colleagues who ask: With the business winning awards and growing its client pool, what’s the point in returning to old ways of working? While he has made his own reservations clear, Mr. Campbell worries that company leaders have made up their minds.
“There’s some sort of cultural linkage to August and September being the time people want to go back,” he added. “It’s tied to that, ‘We’ll get through summer and then we have real work to do.’”
With two years of return-to-office wrangling under their belts, some managers are feeling more confident about spelling out their expectations, both to their employees and to job applicants.
“I’ve had conversations with candidates where they’re very much like ‘I would prefer to work remote.’ Then I have people at the opposite end of the spectrum,” said Ms. Dukes, 40, the director of engineering at Credit Karma.
“Sometimes there are situations where we’re not going to align with a candidate,” she added. “That happens.”"

2022-09-01,"In the coming weeks, Apple and Google will unveil their latest generation of smartphones, jockeying to distinguish the new devices from previous models. But one of the most significant changes will go largely unnoticed by consumers: Some of these phones will not be made in China.
A very small portion of Apple’s latest iPhones will be made in India, and part of Google’s newest Pixel phone production will be done in Vietnam, people familiar with their plans said.
The shift is a response to growing concerns about the geopolitical tensions and pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions that have involved China in the last few years. China has long been the world’s factory floor for high-tech electronics, unrivaled in its ability to secure legions of high-skilled workers and the production capacity to handle demand for the next hot device.
But American companies are seeing more risk there — a perspective forged during the Trump-era trade war, with its tit-for-tat tariffs, and cemented by China’s saber-rattling after Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last month. They fear that basing a supply chain largely in China may thrust them into the middle of its escalating conflict with the United States over Taiwan.

A corporate turnaround artist’s new gig
Yesterday, DealBook broke the news that Starbucks had chosen Laxman Narasimhan as its next chief executive, a hire that puts the 55-year-old in line to run the world’s largest coffee chain and a global corporate giant. With unionization drives, rising inflation and other issues to contend with, that’s a venti-size job for anyone — but who, exactly, is Narasimhan?
He’s a veteran of American and British companies. Born in Pune, India, Narasimhan studied engineering and moved to the U.S. to attend the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. He then joined McKinsey & Company, becoming a senior partner, before shifting in 2012 to PepsiCo, where he oversaw operations in regions including Latin America and Europe. In 2019, he was hired to lead Reckitt Benckiser, the British conglomerate that makes Lysol disinfectant and Durex condoms.
Narasimhan was tasked with cleaning up Reckitt, which had struggled with slowing sales and an ill-fated $16.6 billion takeover of the infant products maker Mead Johnson. He quickly moved to cut costs while investing in Reckitt’s supply chains and product research. He also sold underperforming divisions, and scrapped a potential breakup of the company.
Investors and analysts praised his turnaround work. “The business is now on a fundamentally firmer footing,” Jeremy Fialko, an analyst at HSBC, wrote in a research note yesterday. Reckitt has delivered four consecutive quarters of above-expectations organic sales growth, and in July, it raised its revenue outlook for this year. (In a sign of his perceived worth, Reckitt’s shares fell over 5 percent yesterday after the company disclosed he was leaving.)
Starbucks was drawn to his broad experience across industries and international borders, as well as his knowledge of technology and supply chains. “He’s a true operator and has the DNA of an entrepreneur,” Howard Schultz, the company’s longtime leader and interim C.E.O., told DealBook.
Narasimhan will gradually take the reins at Starbucks: He’ll join the coffee chain in October as “incoming C.E.O.,” but he won’t formally lead until April. During that transition, Schultz said, Narasimhan will get “immersed” in Starbucks’s culture by traveling to stores worldwide and even working behind the counter at some locations."

Elon Musk earns a split decision in Delaware court
Some potential major cracks are beginning to appear in Elon Musk’s suit to undo his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, yesterday’s hearing in Delaware’s Court of Chancery revealed. But Musk has also scored a major victory.
Nearly two hours after DealBook published on Wednesday, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the case, ruled that Musk can amend his suit to include whistle-blower accusations from Peiter Zatko, a former Twitter security chief who claimed that the social network had misled the public about its security practices. However, she rejected Musk’s request for a delay of the trial, which will proceed on Oct. 17. Twitter shares surged 4 percent on the news.
Here are some of the highlights from the hearing on Tuesday:
Musk told his Morgan Stanley banker to slow the deal down less than two weeks after the purchase agreement was announced. On May 8, Musk texted Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to express concerns about the geopolitical environment that could weigh on the deal. “Let’s slow down just a few days. Putin’s speech tomorrow is really important,” said the text, which was read during the hearing and referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It won’t make sense to buy Twitter if we’re heading into World War 3.” On May 13, he tweeted that the deal was on hold. (A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.)
That revelation could put him in breach of contract, which requires the buyer to use his or her best efforts to close a deal. It could also undermine Musk’s complaint that Twitter was not providing information about bots he needed to close the deal. The text makes it seem as if Musk’s private concerns over the transaction had little to do with bots.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Musk discussed re-pricing the deal with Bob Steel, a partner at Perella Weinberg, according to text messages Twitter’s lawyers disclosed yesterday. They detailed an exchange in mid-June in which the two were contemplating using a “contingent value right arrangement” that would have adjusted the payout to Twitter shareholders depending on certain bot figures. (A spokeswoman for Perella Weinberg declined to comment.)
McCormick, at times, showed little patience for Musk’s legal team.
She told Musk’s team that its efforts to fully identify all of the people with whom he spoke to about the deal “bothered me a lot.” She added, “I ordered you to do the job,” and called his team’s response to her request about naming those parties “suboptimal.”
Musk’s lawyers argued that even if Musk had done full due diligence for the deal, the Twitter board would have hid the whistle-blowers’ accusations. McCormick replied: “We don’t know what would have happened in diligence because there wasn’t any due diligence, right?”

A test case for antitrust’s global reach

This is the first application of new E.U. antitrust standards, which were adopted last year.

The move is a sharp reversal in Illumina’s fortunes from last week, when an F.T.C. administrative law judge ruled that the deal did not pose a threat to competition. The agency is appealing.

It’s a sign that antitrust is still a global matter, even if the companies argue that their deals aren’t. Illumina has said its deal posed no issues for the bloc: “Grail has no products or customers in Europe,” Francis deSouza, Illumina’s C.E.O., told DealBook. But antitrust experts say that may not matter, if the E.U.’s precedent holds. DeSouza said that could lead “any country” asserting jurisdiction over any business, regardless of whether it operates in a region.
Illumina is preparing for worst-case scenarios, including divesting Grail, which it formally acquired last year despite continuing antitrust reviews by the U.S. and the E.U. Still, the company plans to appeal both this E.U. ruling and the previous one that gave the European Commission jurisdiction in the matter. “We think everyone needs clarity,” deSouza said.
Green tech investing is hotter than ever
Just weeks ago, President Biden signed into law a landmark climate bill to spur investments in the green tech needed to produce clean energy. The bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, is the latest in a series of policy moves that has led to a recent surge in funding for battery factories, solar panel manufacturing and mining.
Investment in renewables will reach $1.2 trillion by 2035, analysts at Wood Mackenzie estimate — in part because the bill, which will invest $369 billion over 10 years in direct funding, loans and loan guarantees, has brought much-needed certainty to companies that political leaders are serious about steering the country away from fossil fuels, report The Times’s Jack Ewing and Ivan Penn.
Corporations like Toyota and Honda have announced that they are investing billions of dollars to build new factories for batteries for electric cars and hybrids. The mining company Piedmont Lithium said it would build a lithium processing plant in Tennessee as the U.S. looks to ease its dependence on Chinese refineries. First Solar, a big solar panel manufacturer, said it would spend $1.2 billion building a factory in the Southeast to meet growing demand.

But even with the bill delivering a large infusion of federal funding, reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be a challenge, analysts and industry representatives say. The new projects will take time to finish; Toyota’s factory, as well as Honda’s venture with LG, won’t start producing batteries until 2025. Procuring the raw materials for batteries is another challenge. So is location. Landowners, environmentalists and businesses have raised concerns about offshore wind farms near fisheries and about building power lines through farmland, which are needed to transmit solar energy.

What the iPhone 14 will say about Apple
At 10 a.m. Pacific today, Apple will unveil the iPhone 14. But Apple watchers say the newest iPhone is not the main event this year. Expectations for anything truly wowie are teensy-weensy. The 14 is likely to have a pro-size screen, even for the basic model. The camera will be slightly better.
But while the iPhone 14 might not be a big reveal, Apple’s C.E.O., Tim Cook, could still make news if he addresses the biggest issues facing the company — privacy, China and how much innovation is still left in the tech giant. Here’s what to listen for.
On privacy: Unlike its rivals Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook), Apple has long used its commitment to consumer privacy as a selling point. That stance could be under threat as the company seeks more revenue from online advertising, delivering ads on its websites, in Apple Maps or through apps. The Times’s Shira Ovide says it’s hard to do that and not suck up some, or a lot, of consumer data.
On China: Apple’s strong ties to Beijing are perhaps its biggest risk. Apple knows it. The company is making more of its products outside the country. But quitting China, as The Times’s Tripp Mickle reports, will not be easy. “The iPhone has gone from being a product that is designed in California and made in China to one that is a creation of both countries,” Mickle writes.
On innovation: Apple has always used lofty goals to elevate its marketing. And this year’s event, with the tagline “far out,” is no different. But Apple these days has been less about getting consumers to buy new devices, and more about getting users to do more things with their iPhones, like making payments or tracking health. If Cook and others talk about all of the cool new things that an iPhone can do — and less about what Apple might do — today’s event may hardly be the “far out” affair investors had hoped for.

2022-09-08,"WESTMINSTER, Calif. — Dozens of Vietnamese-speaking volunteers filled a community center on a recent Wednesday to phone bank for Representative Michelle Steel, Republican of California, a Korean American lawmaker whose campaign signs and fliers in Vietnamese and English lined the walls.
A few neighborhoods down, Jay Chen, a Democrat and Navy reservist of Taiwanese descent who is challenging Ms. Steel, passed out fliers outside of Zippost, a shipping business that residents often use to send packages to relatives in Vietnam. Mr. Chen, donning a Navy hat, walked around the plaza with a Vietnamese-speaking volunteer in tow helping residents register to vote.
Ms. Steel and Mr. Chen are vying to appeal to the Asian American voters who dominate the electorate in this slice of Orange County, making up a quarter of the voting population. Their race — one of only a few dozen competitive ones that could determine which party controls the House — is being watched closely for clues about what may move voters in this increasingly critical bloc.
“The Asian vote can really give enough votes for a candidate to win,” said Mary Anne Foo, the executive director of the nonprofit Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander Community Alliance, a nonpartisan resource center. “What’s significant now is the number of Asian Americans running for office. Having representation is exciting.”

Across the country, Asian American voters, who comprised 4 percent of the electorate in 2020, are the fastest-growing population of eligible voters. The Asian American Voter Survey found in July that nearly half of Asian Americans identified as Democrats, about a third as independents and about a fifth as Republicans. About two-thirds voted for Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump, surveys show.
However, an analysis by The New York Times found that immigrant communities shifted to the right as they had a surge in voters in 2020. The Asian American Voter Survey found that older Asian voters tended to identify as independent or Republican at higher rates than those in younger generations. Vietnamese Americans, who make up a large proportion of Asian residents in Orange County, also leaned more to the right.

Both candidates in the race have made tackling inflation the centerpiece of their campaigns, and both have also focused on safety amid an increase in reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans — themes that are top of mind for many Asian voters, according to analysts.
Karthick Ramakrishnan, the founder of AAPI Data, which helps conduct the annual Asian American Voter Survey, said the economy and crime were top issues for respondents, which could give an advantage to Republicans. But health care has also been a major issue, he said, which could boost Democrats, who recently pushed through Congress sweeping climate, health and tax legislation that would lower prescription drug costs and subsidize health insurance, among other benefits.

“The ethnicity of the candidate is a bit of a wash in terms of how much it will make a difference here, so it’ll be important to see the kind of appeals each of these candidates make,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said.
Still, race has hung heavily over the contest, sometimes in ugly ways.
Ms. Steel, who was born in South Korea and raised in Japan, has accused Mr. Chen of mocking her accent; he said at a campaign event in April that people need “an interpreter to figure out exactly what she’s saying.” Mr. Chen said in an interview that his comments were misconstrued and that he meant he did not understand her policies.
In the campaign feud, he has accused Ms. Steel of “red-baiting” by painting him as sympathetic to China’s authoritarian government. An accusation of communist sympathies may be particularly resonant to the county’s many refugees who still have bitter memories of fleeing a communist regime.
Mr. Chen, the Harvard-educated son of immigrants who is a member of the board of trustees of Mt. San Antonio Community College and owns a local real estate business, said he has tried to appeal to right-leaning voters with his military experience. He served stints in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula with the Seventh Fleet, which helped evacuate refugees after the Vietnam War.

Ms. Steel, a former member of the county board of supervisors and a local business owner, is fighting to hold onto her seat in a changed political environment. She narrowly defeated Representative Harley Rouda, a Democrat, in 2020 in a district along the California Coast that leaned Republican, becoming one of the first three Korean American women to serve in Congress. But she was displaced by redistricting and opted to run in a new district that tilts slightly toward Democrats.
Lance Trover, the communications director for Ms. Steel’s campaign, said in a statement that she was focused on standing up to China and lowering taxes.
“Michelle is the campaign’s greatest asset because AAPI voters know and trust her,” Mr. Trover said in the statement, using the abbreviation for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Ms. Steel declined to be interviewed.
Orange County was once described by President Ronald Reagan as a place “where the good Republicans go before they die.” Its partisan bent has since shifted as a younger, more diverse population has moved from the Los Angeles metropolitan area seeking more affordable living. Now, Democrats outnumber Republicans in voter registration, and there is a sizable no-party preference voter bloc, according to the latest statistics from the county voter registrar.

The pendulum swung for the first time in 2018, when Democrats swept into the House majority by flipping four seats in the area, giving Democrats control of all seven congressional seats in the county. It swung in the other direction in 2020, when Republicans reclaimed two seats in Orange County.
But the shifts reshaping the area are lasting, and they reflect similar ones underway in suburban enclaves across the country, as immigrant communities relocate out of cities, said Christine Chen, the executive director of Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, which helps conduct the Asian American Voter Survey.

The same trend is underway in Virginia, a state that has leaned toward Democrats in recent years, and in Georgia, she said. Mr. Ramakrishnan added that districts in New Jersey and the suburbs of Houston and Dallas are experiencing a similar dynamic.
“The Asian American population, in all of those instances, has increased so much that, really, elected officials have no choice but to make sure they engage and develop a relationship with the Asian American voters, because they’re coming out to vote,” said Ms. Chen, who is not related to the Democratic candidate challenging Ms. Steel.

Asian Americans make up over a fifth of residents of Orange County, which is known for having the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam, many of whom sought refuge in the region after the Vietnam War.
The district encompasses Little Saigon, a stretch of Vietnamese-owned homes and businesses in the city of Westminster, which looks like most aging suburbs in Southern California: palm trees, stucco single-family homes and sun-bleached signs. Vietnamese and occasionally Korean and Chinese characters are predominantly featured on storefronts, and the political signage clogging up street corners feature mainly candidates with Asian surnames. Both campaigns and local organizations have been investing heavily on advertisements in Vietnamese.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced in July that it planned to make a seven-figure investment to reach Asian voters in California, and the Republican National Committee has opened several Asian Pacific American community centers across the county, a multimillion-dollar investment aiming to recruit volunteers for voter outreach to support Republican candidates, with one of the first in Little Saigon.
John Le, 57, a Vietnamese American Microsoft engineer from Lake Forest who described himself as a traditional Republican, said that, partisan politics aside, he was proud to be in a district with two Asian American candidates. He said he planned to vote for Ms. Steel.
“It’s the American dream,” Mr. Le said. “We should be proud of these people who are giving back to the community. I will look at who will represent me the most.”"

2022-09-12,"“Succession,” HBO’s portrait of a dysfunctional media dynasty, won best drama at the 74th Emmy Awards on Monday night, the second time the series has taken the prize.
Jesse Armstrong, the show’s creator, also took home the Emmy for best writing, the third time he’s won in that category. And Matthew Macfadyen won best supporting actor in a drama for the first time for his performance on the show.
It was the sixth time in eight years that HBO has taken the television industry’s biggest prize for a recurring series, making it yet another triumphant night for the cable network. HBO, as well as its streaming service, HBO Max, won more Emmys (38) than any other outlet, besting its chief rival, Netflix (26).
“The White Lotus,” the cable network’s beloved upstairs-downstairs dramedy that took place at a Hawaiian resort, won best limited series, and tore through several other categories. The show won 10 Emmys altogether, more than any other series. Mike White, the show’s creator and director, won a pair of Emmys for best directing and writing. And performers from the show, Murray Bartlett and Jennifer Coolidge, both received acting Emmys.

“Mike White, my God, thank you for giving me one of the best experiences of my life,” Bartlett, who played an off-the-wagon hotel manager, said from the Emmys stage.
But HBO’s chronicles of the rich were not the only winners on Monday night.
“Ted Lasso,” the Apple TV+ sports series, won best comedy for a second consecutive year, as the tech giant continues on an awards show tear. Apple TV+, which had its debut in November 2019, won best picture at the Oscars (“CODA”) earlier this year. And Jason Sudeikis repeated as best actor in a comedy as the fish-out-of-water soccer coach in “Ted Lasso.”
There were other big moments in the comedy awards. Quinta Brunson, the creator of the good-natured ABC workplace sitcom, “Abbott Elementary,” about a group of elementary schoolteachers at an underfunded Philadelphia public school, won for best writing in a comedy. It was only the second time a Black woman won the award (Lena Waithe was the first, in 2017, for “Master of None”).
In one of the night’s most electric moments, Sheryl Lee Ralph won best supporting actress in a comedy for her role on “Abbott Elementary” as a veteran teacher at the school. Ralph began her Emmys speech by singing “Endangered Species” by Dianne Reeves, and received a standing ovation from the room full of nominees. Her victory was also historic: It was only the second time a Black woman won the award. The last time was in 1987, when Jackée Harry won for her role in the NBC sitcom “227.”
This has been the most competitive Emmys season ever: Submissions for all the categories surged, and 2022 is very likely to set yet another record for the highest number of scripted television series.

But there was also a sense of concern among the executives, producers and agents in attendance at Monday night’s Emmy Awards, that 2022 represents the pinnacle of the so-called Peak TV era, which has produced the highest number of scripted television series, nearly every year, for more than a decade.

Netflix, which lost subscribers this year for the first time in a decade, has laid off hundreds of staffers and is reining in its spending. HBO’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, has shelved projects and is about to lay off a significant number of employees. NBC executives are considering ending its prime-time lineup at 10 p.m., and handing the hour over to local stations.
Business challenges aside, the night was mostly a feel-good celebration. Zendaya won her second Emmy by taking best actress in a drama for her role as a troubled teen in HBO’s “Euphoria.” Jean Smart repeated as the best actress in a comedy for her role as a Joan Rivers-like comedian in HBO Max’s “Hacks.”
“Squid Game,” the blood-splattered, South Korean Netflix series, won a pair of awards: Lee Jung-jae for best actor in a drama, and Hwang Dong-hyuk for directing. Those wins represented a major breakthrough for a foreign language show as television becomes more global, and as American audiences are increasingly receptive to series with subtitles.
Michael Keaton, who played a small town doctor in “Dopesick,” took the best actor award in a limited series. And Amanda Seyfried won best actress in a limited series for her well-received performance as Elizabeth Holmes in “The Dropout.”

Emmy voters often have a habit of finding a winner, and sticking with it, and this year was no different. John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight” won the best talk show category for a seventh consecutive year, and “Saturday Night Live” took the best variety sketch series for a sixth straight year.
This year’s ceremony was the first return to the Microsoft Theater since the pandemic. Producers for the Emmys incorporated an element that it experimented with at last year’s ceremony, which took place inside a tent: Instead of theater-style seating, nominees were gathered around tables with bottles of champagne and wine around them.
This year’s host, Kenan Thompson, the “Saturday Night Live” veteran, opened the ceremony in a top hat and led a group of dancers in a bizarre interpretive dance to theme songs of famous TV series like “Law & Order,” “The Brady Bunch” and “Game of Thrones.”
During his monologue, Thompson took a dig at Netflix’s recent woes.
“If you don’t know what ‘Squid Game’ is, it is the contest you enter when you’re in massive debt and desperate for money,” the host said. “Joining the cast next season? Netflix.”"
2022-09-13,"After two consecutive ceremonies shaped by the pandemic, the Primetime Emmys returned to what felt more or less like a pre-Covid format on Monday night. The awards were handed out in the celebrity-stuffed Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, and the corny bits were about TV clichés, not masks and social distancing.
The show remained fixated on a milder existential threat, however: streaming services. The theme remained dominant even though the ceremony ran on Peacock as well as NBC, with the host, Kenan Thompson, working multiple Netflix digs into his monologue. “For one more year,” The Times’s Mike Hale wrote in his review of the telecast, “we got the weird spectacle of broadcast TV nervously proclaiming its relevance as if it wouldn’t have the chance to do so much longer.”
Along the way, there was the usual array of leaden gags, shameless commercialism and genuinely poignant moments that transcended all the award-show contrivance. There was also, in the success of series like “Abbott Elementary,” evidence that the broadcasters still have some Emmy relevance left in them, even as prestige cable and streaming services claimed the biggest prizes.

Of its seven total nominations, one was for best comedy; had “Abbott” won, it would have been the first network comedy to do so since “Modern Family” in 2014. Based on its performance in its first time out, “Abbott” should be a top Emmy contender for years to come. KALIA RICHARDSON

Jennifer Coolidge won her first Emmy on Monday for her supporting role in the HBO anthology series “The White Lotus.” The show’s creator, Mike White, made the character specifically for Coolidge, who in her early 30s lost her own mother.
True to the oversharing nature of the women she often plays, Coolidge was quick to offer a disclaimer up front: “I just want to say, you know, I took a lavender bath tonight right before the show, and it made me swell up inside my dress,” she said. “And I’m having a hard time speaking.” KALIA RICHARDSON

The rhythm of the show was weirdly off. The intros, clips and bits often felt as if they were in the wrong order; the commentary from the announcer, Sam Jay, didn’t land, and the banter segments were too varied to hit a consistent pace. The ceremony just couldn’t find its stride.
One conspicuous result was that while winners on award shows often note that the countdown clock for their speeches is intimidating, Monday’s Emmy winners seemed extra pressured and thus extra flustered. The show played off engaging winners like Quinta Brunson and Jennifer Coolidge while making plenty of time for inane “copaganda” segments and slow bits that went nowhere.

2022-09-14,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it had charged three Iranians in a wide-ranging hacking campaign across the world that targeted local governments, public utilities and nonprofit institutions, including a domestic violence shelter and a children’s hospital.
According to an indictment unsealed in New Jersey, the men, who remain at large in Iran, breached the computers of hundreds of people in the United States, Israel, Russia and Britain. They demanded ransom in Bitcoin after deploying malware to block access to networks or to steal data and threatening to sell or make public sensitive information if their victims did not pay up, officials at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. said on Wednesday.
The State Department, which is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to their capture, said that those charged worked for tech companies linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful branch of Iran’s military.
The cyberattacks were not directed by the Iranian government, which is in the middle of tense negotiations over its nuclear program, senior law enforcement officials told reporters. In fact, the men tried to extort ransom from Iranian businesses.

Nonetheless, Biden administration officials emphasized that Iran’s unwillingness to crack down on cybercrime within its borders, especially ransomware attacks, along with its history of hacking foreign adversaries, made it easier for the men to operate with relative impunity.
“The government of Iran has created a safe haven where cybercriminals acting for personal gain flourish and defendants like these are able to hack and extort victims, including critical infrastructure providers,” said Matthew G. Olsen, the assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s national security division.
The men, Mansour Ahmadi, Ahman Khatibi Aghda and Amir Hossein Nickaein Ravari, were indicted on conspiracy to commit fraud using a computer and other cyberextortion charges. The scheme, which began in 2020, is believed to still be underway.
The men remain at large in Iran, and prosecutors said they were highly unlikely to face trial in the United States. Officials said they hoped that by exposing the group, they might prevent future attacks. They also released an advisory providing details of the vulnerabilities the hackers exploited, including in the Microsoft Exchange email program.
In a joint move with several U.S. agencies, the State Department announced that it was penalizing 10 Iranians, including the three men, along with two entities for “conducting malicious cyberacts, including ransomware activity,” according to a statement.

All of those named were current or former employees of Najee Technology and the Afkar System Yazd Company, which the State Department has linked to the Revolutionary Guards.
It is not clear how much ransom money the men extracted, but some demands were paid, officials said. Prosecutors believe that the targets of the cyberattacks, identified only by location and a general description of their operations, were selected for no other reason than their systems were known to have vulnerabilities.
In several cases, the men hacked into computer systems; encrypted data using BitLocker, a commercially available software program used to protect information; then demanded payment in exchange for the data, the court filing said.
Victims included a township in Union County, N.J.; a construction business working on critical infrastructure projects and a public housing authority, both in Washington State; accounting firms in Illinois and New Jersey; a county government in Wyoming; and a domestic violence shelter in Pennsylvania.
Two electric power utilities, in Mississippi and Indiana, were also breached, but the intrusion did not affect their operations or cause any power disruptions, officials said.

In February 2021, the men targeted a township in Union County, gained control of its computer network, stole data and employed a hacking tool to set up remote access using a domain registered to Mr. Ahmadi, court documents showed.
In June 2021, the group gained access to the computer network at a children’s hospital, created unauthorized accounts, stole data and tried to encrypt information. Once alerted to the breach, administrators were able to repel the attack without any effect on patient care or medical services.
Last December, the hackers froze access to data at the domestic violence shelter, then ordered the printers to spit out a ransom note that read: “Hi. Do not take any action for recovery. Your files may be corrupted and not recoverable.”
The shelter’s operators quickly agreed to pay Mr. Khatibi Aghda one Bitcoin, then worth $13,000.
They deposited it to his Bitcoin wallet and he freed up their files, prosecutors said.

2022-09-15,"Uber discovered its computer network had been breached on Thursday, leading the company to take several of its internal communications and engineering systems offline as it investigated the extent of the hack.
The breach appeared to have compromised many of Uber’s internal systems, and a person claiming responsibility for the hack sent images of email, cloud storage and code repositories to cybersecurity researchers and The New York Times.
“They pretty much have full access to Uber,” said Sam Curry, a security engineer at Yuga Labs who corresponded with the person who claimed to be responsible for the breach. “This is a total compromise, from what it looks like.”
An Uber spokesman said the company was investigating the breach and contacting law enforcement officials.

Uber employees were instructed not to use the company’s internal messaging service, Slack, and found that other internal systems were inaccessible, said two employees, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Shortly before the Slack system was taken offline on Thursday afternoon, Uber employees received a message that read, “I announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach.” The message went on to list several internal databases that the hacker claimed had been compromised.
The hacker compromised a worker’s Slack account and used it to send the message, the Uber spokesman said. It appeared that the hacker was later able to gain access to other internal systems, posting an explicit photo on an internal information page for employees.
The person who claimed responsibility for the hack told The New York Times that he had sent a text message to an Uber worker claiming to be a corporate information technology person. The worker was persuaded to hand over a password that allowed the hacker to gain access to Uber’s systems, a technique known as social engineering.
“These types of social engineering attacks to gain a foothold within tech companies have been increasing,” said Rachel Tobac, chief executive of SocialProof Security. Ms. Tobac pointed to the 2020 hack of Twitter, in which teenagers used social engineering to break into the company. Similar social engineering techniques were used in recent breaches at Microsoft and Okta.

“We are seeing that attackers are getting smart and also documenting what is working,” Ms. Tobac said. “They have kits now that make it easier to deploy and use these social engineering methods. It’s become almost commoditized.”

The hacker, who provided screenshots of internal Uber systems to demonstrate his access, said that he was 18 years old and had been working on his cybersecurity skills for several years. He said he had broken into Uber’s systems because the company had weak security. In the Slack message that announced the breach, the person also said Uber drivers should receive higher pay.
The person appeared to have access to Uber source code, email and other internal systems, Mr. Curry said. “It seems like maybe they’re this kid who got into Uber and doesn’t know what to do with it, and is having the time of his life,” he said.
In an internal email that was seen by The New York Times, an Uber executive told employees that the hack was under investigation. “We don’t have an estimate right now as to when full access to tools will be restored, so thank you for bearing with us,” wrote Latha Maripuri, Uber’s chief information security officer.
It was not the first time that a hacker had stolen data from Uber. In 2016, hackers stole information from 57 million driver and rider accounts and then approached Uber and demanded $100,000 to delete their copy of the data. Uber arranged the payment but kept the breach a secret for more than a year.

Joe Sullivan, who was Uber’s top security executive at the time, was fired for his role in the company’s response to the hack. Mr. Sullivan was charged with obstructing justice for failing to disclose the breach to regulators and is currently on trial.
Lawyers for Mr. Sullivan have argued that other employees were responsible for regulatory disclosures and said the company had scapegoated Mr. Sullivan."

Members of Congress have access to information that ordinary Americans don’t. They meet with chief executives, read classified intelligence reports and help set the rules by which the economy works.
That level of knowledge can give them an advantage if they or their families want to invest in the stock market — and many of them do: Nearly one in five members of Congress, from both parties, have in recent years bought stocks that intersected with their congressional committee work, a Times investigation found. And that’s probably an underestimate because lawmakers’ work extends beyond their committee duties, my colleague Kate Kelly, who reported on the story, told me.
Among the conflicts uncovered:
The wife of Representative Alan Lowenthal, a California Democrat, sold Boeing shares a day before a House committee that he sits on released a report exposing the company’s mishandling of its 737 Max jet, which had been involved in two deadly crashes.
Representative John Rose, a Republican of Tennessee, sold $100,000 to $250,000 in Wells Fargo stock a few months before a committee he is on released a report that was critical of the bank.
Senator Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican on the Armed Services Committee, and his wife sold options tied to Microsoft less than two weeks before the company lost a $10 billion contract with the Defense Department.

In many of these cases, little or no evidence directly links congressional work to a purchase or a sale. Most lawmakers questioned about potential conflicts of interest say that they followed the law or that a relative or broker with no knowledge of their congressional work made a purchase or sale.
But that demonstrates the problem: Lawmakers can profit from their inside knowledge while remaining within the bounds of the law but creating, at a minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Widespread distrust
The trades exacerbate many voters’ sense that politicians put their own interests above the public’s or the country’s. That, in turn, helps fuel Americans’ distrust of their government. Congress in particular consistently scores poorly in surveys about confidence in institutions."

2022-09-21,"Bowing to what he called an “unforgiving climate,” Robert Sarver said Wednesday that he planned to sell the Phoenix Suns and Mercury amid public pressure after an N.B.A. investigation found that he had mistreated team employees for years.
It was a swift turnabout for Sarver, who seemed determined to hold onto his stakes in both basketball franchises after the N.B.A. last week fined him $10 million and suspended him from team operations for one year. According to the investigation’s report, Sarver had engaged in more than a decade of workplace misconduct, including using racial slurs, making sexual remarks and treating women inequitably.
But following the punitive measures, Sarver — and the N.B.A. — faced mounting public pressure to levy a harsher punishment for behavior N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver had described as “beyond the pale.”
In a statement Wednesday, Sarver said his one-year suspension would have given him time to “make amends and remove my personal controversy” from the teams that he owns.

“But in our current unforgiving climate,” he said, “it has become painfully clear that that is no longer possible — that whatever good I have done, or could still do, is outweighed by things I have said in the past.”
In separate statements, Silver and Suns Legacy Partners L.L.C., the ownership group of the Suns and Mercury, said Sarver’s decision was the best choice for the organization and the community.
“We also know that today’s news does not change the work that remains in front of us,” the ownership group said, adding: “We acknowledge the courage of the people who came forward in this process to tell their stories and apologize to those hurt.”
An N.B.A. spokesman declined to comment when asked whether Silver had pushed Sarver to sell the teams. Last week, Silver defended the fine and suspension issued to Sarver as fair punishment and said he had not asked him to voluntarily sell the teams. The N.B.A.’s board of governors also had not discussed removing him as an owner, he said. Silver could have suspended Sarver for longer than one year, but $10 million was the most he could fine him.
The N.B.A. announced its penalties Sept. 13 after releasing a 43-page public report by the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which conducted a nearly yearlong investigation into Sarver’s conduct in his 18 years with the basketball teams. The N.B.A. began its investigation in response to a November 2021 article by ESPN about accusations of mistreatment against Sarver. The law firm said its investigators interviewed more than 100 individuals who witnessed behavior that “violated applicable standards.”

Sarver, according to the report, made crude jokes, used “the N-word” on at least five occasions, shared inappropriate text messages and photos, and belittled employees. During the investigation, Sarver sought to defend himself by citing his contributions to social and racial justice causes and his support of women’s basketball.
In a statement Wednesday, W.N.B.A. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the league was committed to diversity and inclusion and welcomed the news of Sarver’s decision to sell the Mercury. She had described his fine and suspension as “appropriate and necessary.”
Last week, Suns guard Chris Paul and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James quickly criticized the N.B.A.’s punishment as insufficient. Paul said he was “horrified and disappointed” by what he had read in the report and described Sarver’s behavior as “atrocious.” Tamika Tremaglio, the executive director of the N.B.A. players’ union, said last week that Sarver should be barred from the league for life.
On Wednesday, New Orleans Pelicans guard CJ McCollum, the president of the N.B.A. players’ union, said in a statement that Sarver had made “a swift decision that was in the best interest of our sports community.”
After Sarver announced his plans to sell the Phoenix teams, James said on Twitter that he was “proud to be a part of a league committed to progress,” striking a different note from a week ago when he said the N.B.A. “definitely got this wrong” with its punishment.

“I love this league and I deeply respect our leadership. But this isn’t right,” James said in a tweet last week. “There is no place for misogyny, sexism, and racism in any work place. Don’t matter if you own the team or play for the team. We hold our league up as an example of our values and this aint it.”
The harshest penalty the league has ever levied on a team owner came in 2014 when Donald Sterling, then the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was barred for life after he made racist remarks about Black people in a private conversation and a recording of his comments was made public.
Steve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, agreed to buy the Clippers for about $2 billion just one month later. The quick sale was facilitated when medical experts declared that Sterling was “mentally incapacitated,” which allowed his wife, Rochelle, to have sole trusteeship of the team and negotiate a deal.
Yet selling professional sports teams is often a drawn-out process that can take months or even years.
Owners typically hire one of a handful of bankers who specialize in such transactions. That banker solicits bids from billionaires, corporations or, increasingly, large coalitions of individuals. Sometimes there is a more traditional auction process. Once an agreement is reached, the potential new owner or owners have to be vetted and approved by a vote of the N.B.A.’s board of governors, which includes owners from all 30 teams.

There are a number of factors that can complicate a sale, some of which are present with the Phoenix Suns.
While Sarver controls the Suns and the Mercury, he owns just 35 percent of Suns Legacy Partners L.L.C., the legal entity that owns the teams. Potential buyers may want to purchase 100 percent of the teams, which would involve negotiating with other members of the ownership group — though some of them may want to buy the team and may have a leg up after already having been vetted and approved by the N.B.A.
Arenas and associated commercial development can also complicate sales. While the Suns ownership group manages the Footprint Center, where the Suns and the Mercury play their home games, the arena is owned by the City of Phoenix.
Teams usually sell to those willing to pay the most money, but not always. Sometimes owners value non-monetary terms, like an agreement to keep a team in a specific city, and the method and terms of payment for teams can also matter.
When team owners have been more or less forced to sell teams, the outcomes have varied widely.
In 2017, Jerry Richardson announced he would sell the Carolina Panthers shortly after Sports Illustrated reported allegations of workplace misconduct. Five months later, after a fairly typical sales process, David Tepper agreed to buy the Panthers for at least $2.2 billion, which was the highest price for an N.F.L. team at the time.

The sale of Real Salt Lake, an M.L.S. team, took much longer. In August 2020, M.L.S. announced that Dell Loy Hansen would sell the team, after Hansen was reported to have made racist comments. It took 17 months for Hansen and M.L.S. to find a buyer, and the league had to operate the team for a season.
The N.B.A. has also agreed to less severe punishments when inquiries have found workplace misconduct.
In 2018, Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, agreed to pay $10 million to women’s leadership and domestic-violence organizations after an N.B.A. investigation confirmed reports of sexual harassment and other improper conduct among employees in the team’s front office.
Cuban did not face accusations of misconduct, but the investigation found his supervision lacking. According to the report, Terdema Ussery, the former team president and chief executive, was one of several high-ranking team officials who had engaged in inappropriate conduct toward female employees.
After the report was released, Cuban apologized and said he had missed opportunities to correct the culture of his organization.

The cost of rebuilding Ukraine
This month, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine announced that the country had assembled a team of bankers and researchers to solicit investments from private businesses to help pay for Ukraine’s recovery. Zelensky said the team had identified more than $400 billion of potential investment for what is effectively a Marshall Plan for Ukraine, the U.S. program that provided aid to Western Europe after World War II.
Yesterday, DealBook spoke with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, about what it would take to rebuild the country battered by Russia’s war.
Ukraine estimates it would cost $750 billion. The country hopes to develop a fund to invest the money it raises for its recovery after the war, Shmyhal said. The initial basis would be confiscated Russian assets, but Ukraine also said it wanted help from private businesses. Mr. Zelensky met virtually last week with BlackRock’s Larry Fink, and Shmyhal said Ukrainian officials would meet with other American business executives this week.
Insuring investments could be an option for money raised during the war. “All private businesses understand that, for every investment, there could be a loss during the second a rocket missile flies and destroys it,” Shmyhal said, adding that Ukraine was pushing to make an international form of war insurance available for investments within its territory.
Transparency and anti-corruption efforts will be key. Transparency International, an anticorruption watchdog, ranked Ukraine 122nd out of 180 countries on its corruption index last year. Shmyhal said that the country’s European Union membership bid came with stringent anticorruption requirements, and that it had taken steps to safeguard investments in its recovery. He said Ukraine reported how it spends global aid to the World Bank. And its recovery fund, Shmyhal said, would “be open for our partners in which we invite them to participate on the management basis and on a supervisory report basis.”
No matter how much money Ukraine raises, geography will be a challenge. Unlike the 16 countries that received Marshall Plan aid, Ukraine will continue to have a neighbor — Russia — that wants to take it over (and other neighbors, like Belarus, that are sympathetic to Moscow’s views.) Also complicating Ukraine’s pitch for aid is war fatigue. Inflation, and in particular food and energy prices, has spiraled since the start of war, sapping the resolve of some in Western countries to commit to further relief efforts.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The dollar extends its dominance against other currencies. The British pound, the euro and the Swiss franc all fell against the greenback — the first two to multiyear lows — as investors seek out a safe haven. Risky assets, including stocks, continue to slide after recent moves by central banks in several countries to raise interest rates to combat inflation.
Boeing settles securities fraud charges for $200 million. The fine resolves an investigation by the S.E.C. over whether the aircraft maker had misled investors about problems with the 737 Max. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s former C.E.O., will pay a $1 million fine.
The World Bank’s president moves to allay climate change criticism. David Malpass, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, said he believed human activity was warming the planet, days after refusing to say so publicly. Critics have accused the World Bank of failing to do enough to help countries affected by climate disasters.
The S.E.C. reportedly won’t ban payment for order flow. Upcoming stock-trading rules from the regulator will stop short of preventing market makers from paying retail brokerages to execute customer trades, according to Bloomberg. The S.E.C. may still introduce provisions that make the practice less profitable.
Apple will sponsor the Super Bowl halftime show. The iPhone maker will replace Pepsi as the event’s backer, the N.F.L. announced yesterday. But Apple and the league are still negotiating over a much bigger deal: the streaming rights to Sunday Ticket games, for which the N.F.L. is seeking $2.5 billion.

Goldman’s ‘boys club’ culture to go on trial
Yesterday, 1,400 current and former Goldman Sachs executives and associates suing the bank for gender bias published unsealed records that shed new light on their claims that an illegal “boys club” culture pervades there. The suit claiming pay and performance discrimination was filed in 2010, and is set to go to trial in June in a New York federal court.
It “is an important moment for understanding issues women have been raising at the company and hearing their voices directly,” Kelly Dermody, a partner at Lieff Cabraser, which is coleading the plaintiffs’ case with Outten & Golden, told DealBook. Goldman did not respond to a request for comment.

Judging company culture. In court documents, one woman said that it was “widely known” an unnamed managing director is “inappropriate toward young women,” and that left her “terrified of being with him alone.” In all, 133 Goldman staff members — from the firm’s investment banking, investment management and securities divisions — reported incidents of discrimination, sexual harassment and assaults, retaliation and more. The case covers claims of discrimination beginning in 2002. The women also  said that male managers organized trips to strip clubs and golf gatherings deliberately to exclude women. In addition, they claim managers “engage in gender stereotyping, sexual harassment, and/or gender favoritism,” including in performance evaluations.
“The Plaintiffs’ presentation of the complaints does not reflect reality at Goldman Sachs. Many are two decades old and have been presented selectively, inaccurately and are incomplete,” a company spokeswoman told DealBook. “Discrimination, harassment and mistreatment in any form are unacceptable at Goldman Sachs, and when identified, swift action, including termination, is taken.”
Shareholders want answers. Last year, an investor group raised concerns that the bank’s mandatory arbitration policies, which are intended to help keep bank secrets, could allow harassment and discrimination to go unaddressed, limit legal relief and prevent employees from learning about repeat offenders. In December, the bank reported that a review of its dispute resolution policies found they were sound, making few adjustments.
Nearly 700 of the putative plaintiffs were originally excluded from the class action because of the bank’s arbitration process; several hundred have since opted in.

A risky bet on growth (and banks)
This morning, Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, introduced a long-awaited raft of new policies, including sweeping deregulation and a series of tax cuts. The plan was meant to harken back to Thatcher-era policies — but comes at a fraught time for Britain’s public finances.
Here’s what to expect:
Tax cuts: In a surprise move, Kwarteng will scrap Britain’s top income tax rate of 45 percent, applied to those who earn more than 150,000 pounds, or about $169,000, a year and cut the basic rate for lower earners. Kwarteng also said the government would abandon a planned rise in corporate taxes and another on national insurance contributions, and reduce a levy on home purchases.
Deregulation: The government will remove a cap on banker bonuses, a move made possible by Brexit that is meant to bolster London’s competitiveness as a global financial center. It will also end a ban on fracking and will streamline construction planning laws.
Kwarteng pitched the moves as a way to supercharge Britain’s economy, with a goal of getting back to 2.5 percent annual growth, a level not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Since being elected as prime minister, Liz Truss has promised a return to the small-government, business-minded ethos of Margaret Thatcher, her political idol and a touchstone for the governing Conservative Party.
The strategy is a high-wire fiscal act. Truss is already planning to subsidize soaring energy costs for consumers and businesses, which will draw on a wave of government borrowing. British government bonds fell sharply after Kwarteng’s announcement, as did stocks on London’s FTSE 100 index. The pound fell to a 37-year low of $1.10. George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank’s global head of foreign exchange research, warned in a client note this morning that “sterling is in danger” of falling further.
Economists and investors have been worried about Britain’s dismal economic prospects, with climbing inflation and rising interest rates. An independent report this week said that the widely telegraphed budget proposals would put British public finances on an “unsustainable path.”

There are political risks as well. Polls suggest that Britons favor higher taxes and more government spending on areas like health care and education. And ending caps on banker pay is deeply unpopular. Truss and Kwarteng are hoping to get traction on an economic recovery ahead of national elections in 2024.

A workplace pipe dream closer to being a reality
The four-day workweek has long been a workplace dream. In 1956, Richard Nixon, who was vice president at the time, said he foresaw it in the “not too distant future.” Spoiler: Nixon was off.
In June, more than 70 companies in Britain decided to test that idea with a pilot program that allowed workers to get an extra day off weekly. More than 3,300 workers in banks, marketing, health care, financial services, retail, hospitality and other industries participated.

Productivity test. Halfway into the six-month trial, 46 percent of the companies that responded to a survey said they had seen no loss of productivity, and 15 percent said they had even seen significant improvements, writes The Times’s Jenny Gross. And 86 percent of the companies said they were “likely” or “extremely likely” to consider continuing the four-day week after the trial.
But can the economy sustain a trimming of the workweek? Proponents said a four-day workweek bolstered employees’ well-being and allowed them to be more present and effective. Critics worried about added costs and reduced competitiveness. And it still may be too soon to say how a shortened workweek would affect a company’s bottom line.

2022-09-26,"Uber was hacked this month. The company said that the attacker — a teenager possibly linked to the incident was just arrested in London — most likely obtained the corporate password of an Uber contractor. Using that person’s access, the hacker gained access to some of Uber’s internal systems: internal Slack messages, a finance tool for invoices and the dashboard where the company’s security researchers report bugs and vulnerabilities. It’s a big deal, and an embarrassment to the company.
Uber has said that it believes that the attacker is affiliated with a hacking group called Lapsus$, whose members are mostly teenagers and which has recently targeted several technology companies. Uber also said it had not seen any evidence that user data was compromised during the incident. In the lawsuits that will invariably result, we will learn more about what happened.
But any litigation against the company, whether it be by government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, or class-action lawsuits by shareholders or perhaps even customers, will focus on the proximate causes of the hack. More fundamental are the underlying causes of security breaches: Current economic and political forces incentivize companies to skimp on security at the expense of both personal and national security. If we are ever to have a hope of doing better, we need to change the market incentives.
When you’re a high-tech start-up company, you are likely to cut corners in a lot of areas. It makes business sense — your primary focus is to earn customers and grow quickly enough to remain in business when your venture capital funding runs out. Anything that isn’t absolutely essential to making the business work is left for later, and that includes security culture and practices. It’s a gamble: Spending money on speed and features rather than security is a more likely path to success than being secure yet underfunded, underfeatured, or — worst of all — a year later to market.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Security can be improved later, but only if necessary. If you’ve survived the start-up world and become a runaway success, you’ve had to scale to accommodate your customers or users. You’ve been forced to improve performance and reliability, because your new higher-profile customers demand more. You’ve had to make your internal systems work for your hundreds and maybe thousands of employees. You’re now an established company, and you had better look and act that way.

But in all of that, you’ve never had incentive to upgrade your security. The quick-and-dirty systems you built in the beginning still work, and your customers or users don’t know what’s going on behind the curtain. Your employees are expected not to tell anyone, like chefs being told to stay in the kitchen. And truth be told, it’s expensive and time-consuming to rebuild everything from the ground up with security in mind.
This is something I see again and again in companies, and not only in start-ups. It’s even the same thing that the former Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko (better known as Mudge) is accusing that company of doing. Companies large and small skimp on security when the market doesn’t reward doing any better. The result is that hackers have an easier time breaking into networks, and once they break in there are few controls that prevent them from accessing everything.
Some companies do manage to make the change. We saw it with Microsoft, when Bill Gates changed the company’s direction in 2002 with a now-famous memo. Google’s shift to a more robust security culture happened in 2010, after being hacked by attackers in China.
The lack of incentives obviously has profound implications for the security of all of our personal data, stored by a seemingly unknowable number of different companies who are all collecting dossiers on our movements and habits. It also has national security implications. We know that countries are stealing as much data as possible for their own purposes. China, in particular, is apparently using its resources collecting data on Americans in general. State-sponsored Chinese hackers are believed to be behind the theft of personal data on U.S. government employees, especially those with security clearances, from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in 2015. Hackers suspected of working on behalf of the country’s civilian spy agency were also apparently behind the theft of data on 500 million guests from the Marriott hotel chain in 2018 and about 80 million former and current patients and employees from the health insurer Anthem in 2015.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In all of these cases, the victimized organizations could have very likely protected our data better, but the reality is that the market does not reward healthy security. Often customers aren’t even able to abandon companies with poor security practices, as many of them build “digital moats” to lock their users in. Customers don’t abandon companies with poor security practices. Hits to the stock prices quickly recover. It’s a classic market failure of a powerful few taking advantage of the many, and that failure is one that only representation through regulation can fix.
We need strong regulations that force organizations to maintain good security practices. The focus must be on resilient security for the user data entrusted to the company. Government regulation should not be involved (for example) if Uber loses the source code to its phone apps or its employee Slack channel. Government regulation should be involved if Uber loses data about the rides taken by its 100 million-plus users. (One risk of this data for Uber: It can be used to find one-night stands, for either fun or blackmail opportunities.)
Worries that any regulation will somehow quell innovation are overblown. Good security isn’t incompatible with features, agility or time to market. But even so, a smart internet-security regulatory regime will take a page from successful industry regulations such as banking, and tailor requirements to the size of the organization. Just as a small local bank doesn’t have to follow the same level of regulation that a large national bank does, or a jumbo jet has a more extensive preflight checklist than a single-engine two-seater, there’s no reason a small start-up with only a few customers has to follow the same rules as a Twitter or an Uber. And as a company becomes larger and more successful, its security requirements should increase because the impact of insecurity increases.
In 2020, Russian hackers breached the internet infrastructure company SolarWinds. SolarWinds followed the trajectory from start-up to established company. This particular hack was a national security disaster. The hackers were able to use their access to penetrate the computer networks of some 18,000 SolarWinds customers, including U.S. government agencies such as the Homeland Security Department and State Department, government contractors, nuclear research labs, I.T. companies, and nongovernmental agencies around the world. Here again, the market rewarded poor security practices in the name of short-term profits. If the government mandated better ones, things might have turned out differently.
Last week’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, “Protecting Americans’ Private Information From Hostile Foreign Powers,” further highlighted that personal data privacy is now a matter of national security.

2022-09-27,"WASHINGTON — With only months remaining before it closes up shop, the House Jan. 6 committee is wrangling over how best to complete its work, with key decisions yet to be made on issues that could help shape its legacy.
The panel, whose public hearings this summer exposed substantial new details about former President Donald J. Trump’s efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election, must still decide whether to issue subpoenas to Mr. Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.
It has yet to settle on whether to enforce subpoenas issued to Republican members of Congress who have refused to cooperate with the inquiry, or what legislative recommendations to make. It must still grapple with when to turn its files over to the Justice Department, how to finish what it hopes will be a comprehensive written report and whether to make criminal referrals. And on Tuesday, it abruptly postponed a hearing that had been scheduled for Wednesday as a hurricane bore down on Florida, even as its members disagreed publicly over whether the next session would be its last.
The panel had not disclosed the topics it intended to cover at its next hearing, and gave no date for rescheduling the session, which will be its first since July. But it is still working to break new ground with its investigation.

It recently had a breakthrough when Virginia Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, agreed to a voluntary interview about her role in seeking to keep Mr. Trump in office. That interview is expected to take place within weeks.
The committee also issued a subpoena to Robin Vos, the Republican House speaker in Wisconsin whom Mr. Trump tried to pressure as recently as July to overturn the 2020 election, suggesting that the panel tracked Mr. Trump’s activities long after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and his departure from office two weeks later. (Mr. Vos has sued to try to block the committee’s subpoena.)
“Our hearings have demonstrated the essential culpability of Donald Trump, and we will complete that story,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee.
But the committee has debated whether and how to highlight certain information related to the Jan. 6 attack. For instance, some members and staff have wanted to hold a hearing to highlight the panel’s extensive work investigating the law enforcement failures related to the assault, but others have argued that doing so would take attention off Mr. Trump.
And it has struggled in recent weeks with staff departures and is facing public criticism from a former aide, Denver Riggleman, who says it has not been aggressive enough in pursuing connections between the White House and the rioters.

The final stages of its planned 18 months of work are playing out against a shifting political climate. Polls suggest that Democrats could lose control of the House in November’s midterm elections. Mr. Trump is showing every intention of seeking the presidency again, and the committee’s Republican vice chairwoman, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who lost her primary in August, appears to be positioning herself as the party’s anti-Trump White House candidate for 2024, with the panel’s conclusions as part of her platform.
Ms. Cheney on Saturday seemed to contradict other committee members by describing this week’s hearing as unlikely to be the last. Other members, including the committee’s chairman, have said it would likely be their final presentation.
With that backdrop, the next hearing could be seen as the first step in the closing stages of the committee’s work.
“What they have to do is strategic,” said Norman L. Eisen, who was special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2020, including for the first impeachment and trial of Mr. Trump. “The first part of the endgame is to close the deal with the American people.”

The panel set high expectations for itself by revolutionizing what a congressional hearing could look like. Preparing for the hearing that had been scheduled for Wednesday had consumed the committee’s focus in recent weeks.

“They’ve pretty uniformly met and exceeded expectations,” Mr. Eisen said. “And when you’ve done that eight times, that suggests that you know what you’re doing. I suspect part of the reason that they took a lengthy hiatus — and by all reports worked very hard over the summer — was to be able to come back in September with a bang.”
To some degree, the committee is now competing for attention with other investigations into Mr. Trump and his allies. The New York attorney general has filed a sweeping fraud suit against Mr. Trump and his family. Prosecutors in Georgia are conducting grand jury interviews about efforts to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss there. And the Justice Department is now conducting criminal inquiries into both the events that led to the Jan. 6 attack and Mr. Trump’s handling of classified documents he took with him upon leaving the White House.
To help with its end game, the panel has quietly rehired John Wood, a former federal prosecutor who is close to Ms. Cheney. Before he left the panel for a brief, unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate in Missouri, Mr. Wood led the committee’s “Gold Team,” which investigated Mr. Trump and his inner circle.
It has also expanded its number of staff members from about 50 up to 57, according to Congress’s latest financial data, and has spent about $5.3 million over its first year in existence.
But at the same time, the committee has had five staff members put in resignation notices in recent weeks. Among them is Amanda Wick, a former federal prosecutor who was featured in a committee hearing and led the panel’s “Green Team,” which investigated the money trail connected to Jan. 6, including political donations and the funding of the rallies that preceded the violence.

The next hearing is expected to feature new video of the Jan. 6 attack and also new clips of some of the committee’s hundreds of interviews with witnesses. And the panel planned to include parts of a trove of evidence it obtained from a documentary filmmaker about how Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime confidant to Mr. Trump, encouraged violence before the Jan. 6 attack and sought a pardon afterward.
Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, said the committee would focus some of its energy on ongoing threats to democracy, such as 2020 election deniers gaining power over election systems.
“We have found additional information,” Ms. Lofgren said. “We worked throughout the summer.”
Committee investigators held closed-door interviews with senior Trump administration officials in an effort to uncover more about the period between Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters attacked Congress, and Jan. 20, when President Biden was sworn in, including talks about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office.
The panel at one point considered inviting generals who worked for Mr. Trump to deliver firsthand accounts of his behavior. (The idea has not moved forward.)
Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee, said the panel recently received a trove of documents from the Secret Service in response to a subpoena it issued after the news that agents’ text messages from Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, 2021, had been lost.

A spokesman for the agency said the Secret Service provided a “significant level of detail from emails, radio transmissions, Microsoft Teams chat messages and exhibits that address aspects of planning, operations and communications surrounding January 6th.” But the spokesman said the documents did not include any additional text messages, such as those sought by the committee that were erased during an upgrade of phones.
Members of the committee had originally seen their investigation, and the possibility of a criminal referral, as a way of putting pressure on the Justice Department to pursue a criminal case. But with federal prosecutors now investigating elements of Mr. Trump’s efforts to retain power despite losing at the ballot box, the House committee is considering a new suggestion for the information it uncovered about Mr. Trump and his allies raising money by promoting baseless assertions about election fraud: making a referral to the Federal Election Commission, a largely toothless body that can weigh abuses of campaign finance laws.
“F.E.C. would be a good possibility,” Mr. Thompson said. “Obviously we looked seriously at some of the fund-raising that went on around Jan. 6.”
Members have also been discussing what legislative recommendations they should make. Last week, to close off the possibility of another president trying to have a vice president block the certification by Congress of the Electoral College results, Ms. Cheney and Ms. Lofgren introduced an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act, which quickly passed the House. (Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, on Tuesday endorsed a somewhat different version awaiting action in the Senate, bolstering its prospects of enactment.)
Members are also discussing reforms to the Insurrection Act, legislation related to the 14th and 25th amendments and regulation of militia groups. They also are likely to recommend improvements to Capitol security.

Not all the panel’s recommendations have found agreement. Mr. Raskin, for instance, has pushed for recommending that the Electoral College be eliminated, but that idea has been met with resistance from Ms. Cheney and others and is unlikely to be included in the final recommendations.

2022-09-29,"Google said it would shutter the video game streaming service Stadia, its answer to Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation video game consoles, in another sign of Google’s drive to be leaner amid fears of an economic slowdown.
Stadia, which has streamed games over the internet rather than requiring expensive consoles, will shut down on Jan. 18, Phil Harrison, Stadia’s vice president and general manager, wrote on Thursday in a blog post. The product debuted nearly three years ago, promising to revolutionize how people play video games. But it failed to catch on with enough gamers.
“It hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected, so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service,” Mr. Harrison wrote.
Google will refund all game hardware purchases made through the Google Store, as well as game purchases made in the Stadia Store, Mr. Harrison wrote. He said the company expected to complete most refunds by the middle of January.

The company had already begun selling Stadia’s underlying streaming technology to other businesses, and said it expected that many Stadia team members would be “carrying this work forward in other parts of the company.” In February 2021, Google shut down Stadia’s in-house game studio, which had been formed to create new titles, prompting fears that the entire service might one day disappear.
Stadia is just the latest product to be killed by Google. The company is set to shutter Hangouts, its messaging app, in November. And YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, announced in January that it would stop making original content.
Amid rising inflation and concerns about economic instability, Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, has begun what he calls a “Simplicity Sprint,” an effort to improve business efficiencies and trim unnecessary expenses. The company recently cut funding and jobs at its in-house tech incubator, Area 120, and it has canceled unnecessary business travel.
Marc Rodriguez, the chief operating officer of VoxPop Games, said in an interview that he had mixed emotions about Google’s decision to end the service because his company had shared Stadia’s challenges, including competing with the gaming giants Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, and with the fixed habits of gamers.
Charles Yu, VoxPop’s chief executive, added, “Hardcore gamers are saying, ‘Well, I already have the hardware, and I’m used to using this service,’ so they don’t adopt, even if there’s a new technology.”

The planned shutdown was disappointing to those who used Stadia frequently.
“A lot of people like myself feel very betrayed,” said Jon Jameson, 36, of Lyman, S.C., adding that he felt “every emotion from anger to just feeling bad for the staff” who worked there.
Mr. Jameson, who has lived on long-term disability insurance since being in a car accident 10 years ago, said he had played games like Assassin’s Creed on Stadia every day, “looking for escapes when I’m not doing exercises.”
For Gabe Maier, 37, of Linthicum, Md., Stadia was a family affair. He has spent $1,000 on games and controllers since the service’s inception, and said he loved Stadia because his children could play on his phone or tablet while the adults watched television. He said that his young daughters enjoyed the game Pikuniku and that he had his own weekly playing sessions.
Mr. Maier, who owns an Android phone and uses many of Google’s products, said in an interview that Stadia’s looming expiration was “super disappointing.”
“It leans into the worst perceptions of Google, which is that they’re quick to innovate and quick to throw the baby out with the bath water,” he said. “The people they hurt the most are the people most committed to the brand.”"

The ties that bind
Technology stocks have long been seen as the market’s most rewarding but riskiest investments. Bonds have the opposite reputation. This year, both have ended up in the same place — deep in the red.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell nearly 3 percent yesterday, and is now down nearly 30 percent for the year. Meanwhile bonds, spooked by inflation and the Federal Reserve’s promise to keep raising interest rates to fight rising prices, are facing their most devastating period since at least 1926.
It’s rare for bonds and tech stocks to tumble together. In 2000, when the dot-com bust cratered tech, bond prices rose nearly 12 percent. Same was true in 2008. Tech stocks fell 42 percent, while bond prices rose 5 percent.
The alignment might be more natural now. Tech companies are more vulnerable to higher interest rates than they used to be.
One reason is borrowing. Apple, for instance, had just $300 million in debt in 2000. The iPhone maker now has nearly $95 billion.
Another is their size. Microsoft’s sales are seven times as much as they were 20 years ago. And as technology companies have grown, they are more tied to the ups and downs of the economy in general.
But don’t expect the relationship to continue forever. Venture capital and private equity funds remain full of cash, and ready to invest in promising firms. What’s more, higher interest rates will send investors looking for higher returns, and that favors tech shares. For now, though, higher interest rates, and the threat of a recession, are pounding every investment, and that includes tech. “It’s a painful quicksand moment for the tech sector,” said Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities.
Nasdaq futures this morning point to a mild rebound when markets open. But the macro data indicates more trouble ahead. Inflation is running red hot — this morning, eurozone price increases hit a record high — putting pressure on central banks to raise interest rates further to rein in consumer demand, placing the global economy at further risk of slowing. In such a climate, corporate profits could suffer, dealing another headache to investors whose portfolios hold a heavy mix of stocks and bonds.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Ian heads toward South Carolina. The storm, strengthened again to a hurricane, left about two million customers without power in Florida this morning. More than 2.5 million people near the ocean in multiple states were also under hurricane warnings early today.
The Senate passes an emergency funding bill. Legislation approved yesterday will keep the federal government running past today’s deadline and will send more aid to Ukraine. President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law by midnight.
The E.U. backs a power-reduction plan. Energy ministers agreed today to measures to reduce consumption and tame climbing gas prices. Steps will include windfall taxes on fossil-fuel companies and targets for lowering electricity use during peak hours.
Look to Nike for what ails multinationals. Shares in the company fell more than 10 percent in premarket trading after the company disclosed problems that reflected an array of economic ills: growing inventories tied to supply-chain disruptions, a need to hold more sales to liquidate them and weaker overseas sales because of a strong dollar.
Meta prepares for layoffs. The tech giant’s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, told employees this week that the company would freeze all hiring. Zuckerberg said a drop in the company’s revenue made the job cuts necessary.

Why Elon’s texts (and tweets) matter
Yesterday, a slew of text messages between Elon Musk, the Twitter board, Musk’s bankers at Morgan Stanley and a supportive cadre of Silicon Valley stalwarts were made public as part of the billionaire’s legal fight to get out of his $44 billion deal to buy the social network. The texts, revealed in a court filing, offer fresh insights into the rally of support for Musk’s bid. They also exposed how desperate Wall Street was to get Musk’s business, and shed new light on some fundamental issues about the case.

Musk believed bots were a big problem. In a text to Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, the day he told the company he planned to take it private, Musk wrote that it would be hard to fix Twitter as a public company, because “fake users will make the numbers look terrible, so restructuring should be done as a private company.” Twitter cited this text in its lawsuit seeking to force Musk to acquire the company, and it goes to the heart of one of the main legal arguments in the case: Despite his concern about the spam count, Musk made his offer without any stipulations around the accuracy of its spam numbers.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
And the spam data may not help Musk’s case, anyway. When Musk first sought to call off the deal, on July 8, he cited an analysis by his own advisers that concluded that the percentage of active Twitter users who are actually spam is “wildly higher than 5 percent.” (Musk has said that Twitter’s estimates that 5 percent of active users are spam is misleading.) But according to a court filing revealed yesterday, one outside firm put the percentage at 5.3. Could such a meager difference derail the deal?
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Musk’s intent in buying Twitter could matter, too. Many of the texts between Musk and the Twitter board in the lead up to the deal — as well as those with his various supporters — center on Musk’s goal to rid the platform of spam and use it promote free speech. Expressing such noble aims could overshadow his complaints of bots and spam being part of some larger “material adverse effect” that’s eroding the value of a firm he once wanted to buy. “Courts talk about whether there have been sufficient changes to call the economics of the deal into question,” said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School. It’s unclear how that applies when the buyer makes clear the economics don’t matter much to him, Lipton adds.
Speaking of those text messages … Here’s a sample of the many that were released yesterday:
“Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job,” the investor Jason Calacanis wrote to Musk.
The venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson recommended Musk hire the former Uber executive Emil Michael as Twitter’s C.E.O. — and his own son as an engineer.
When Musk tried urgently to reach out to Oracle’s Larry Ellison, a former Tesla board member, Ellison brushed him off: “Sorry. Let’s talk tomorrow.”
“Maybe Oprah would be interested in joining the Twitter board if my bid succeeds,” Musk wrote to the journalist Gayle King, a noted friend of Oprah Winfrey’s. (King called Musk’s offer a “gangsta move.”)
Big banks face new climate resiliency tests
This week’s extreme weather in Florida heightened the debate in Washington — and beyond — about the financial risks that climate change poses to banks.
Yesterday, the Fed announced that six of the biggest U.S. banks — Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo — were expected to participate in a pilot program next year to test their resilience and risks under different climate hypotheticals.
The Fed said that the program was “exploratory in nature” and that it would not have capital consequences.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Environmentalists lauded the move. Adele Shraiman of the Sierra Club told DealBook the program was “long overdue.” She argued that there was “really broad consensus” among financial authorities around the world that climate risk is a reality, but that the banks and regulators were not addressing those risks fast enough. The storm in Florida has been a “prime example” of physical risk, she said, but the much less visible risks come from failing to transition to green energy, from continuing to invest in fossil fuel companies and from the possibility that those types of companies could fail.
Similarly, a report yesterday from Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group, said that banks were making progress on climate goals, but that important aspects of the business, like the $600 trillion derivatives market, remain a “black box in terms of climate risk.”
Climate requirements may be an overstep, some industry representatives counter. In response to the Fed’s announcement, the Bank Policy Institute, an advocacy group representing the nation’s leading banks, said that recent research suggested “that the near-term risks are entirely manageable for large banks” and that regulatory requirements “seem to be disproportionate to the risk.”
The conflicting stances are creating friction for banks. Whether climate change presents material financial risks has long been a fraught political question, so American banking officials have been slower to explore the answers than their counterparts in Europe. At the same time, Republican politicians are amping up their fight against environmental, social and governance investing, creating headaches for banks and making them wary of international climate commitments.

David Gottesman made billions from his ties to Warren Buffett.

Remembering Sandy Gottesman
David Gottesman, a longtime friend of Warren Buffett and a billionaire financier, died on Wednesday at age 96. Known as Sandy to his intimates, he quietly became a force in money management, as well as a major donor to charity.

Gottesman became one of Buffett’s close associates early on, after the two met in 1963 and bonded over investing discussions. Gottesman went on to found First Manhattan, an investment firm that now manages some $20 billion. But Gottesman’s most profitable decision was betting on Buffett: Gottesman invested in Berkshire Hathaway, gaining a stake that made him a billionaire.
“There probably has never been a better return on any stock held for 44 years in the history of Wall Street,” Gottesman wrote a decade ago.

Buffett regarded him as a close friend and adviser. He credited Gottesman with helping prevent an investment in a department store from becoming a financial disaster, and put Gottesman on Berkshire’s board. (Gottesman reportedly inadvertently inspired Buffett to invest in Apple when he lost his iPhone in a cab.)
“Absent Sandy doing anything financially for me, we would have been the best of friends,” Buffett told The Times yesterday.

2022-10-07,"Walk into any grocery store and it’s only too obvious that a dollar won’t buy much of anything, not even a quart of milk.
Inflation has done that. The latest government figures showed that in August, even a fistful of dollars bought 11.4 percent less food, 25.6 percent less gasoline and 6.2 percent less housing than they did a year earlier.
Any American consumer knows very well that a dollar doesn’t have the swagger it once did in the United States. Yet in financial circles, it is frequently said that the dollar is strong. I’ve written this in previous columns, and the claim is repeated constantly in headlines and speeches.
But what do we mean when we say the dollar is strong?
Recognize, first, that the phrase isn’t neutral. Given a choice between strong and weak, who wants to be weak? When it’s said the dollar is strong — and traditional U.S. government policy says the dollar should always be strong — that sounds unambiguously positive, with a precise meaning.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But the strong dollar is neither of those.
Paul O’Neill, Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2002, was forthright about this, after he left office. “I was not supposed to say anything but ‘strong dollar, strong dollar,’” he said. “I argued then and would argue now that the idea of a strong-dollar policy is a vacuous notion.”
Really, there are at least three meanings when we say, “The dollar is strong.” None is entirely good for American consumers or investors.
First, and most straightforward, the dollar buys more yen, pounds, euros and renminbi than it has in decades. It can be exchanged for more foreign currency.
Second, the dollar anchors international finance and commerce, a role once played by the British pound.
Third, the dollar is a weapon, one that the United States is using against adversaries like Russia and Iran.
In all three ways, the dollar is playing an extraordinarily important role, not just in the United States but almost everywhere on the planet.
If you are a consumer, an investor or just a person who wants to live peacefully and prosperously, the strong dollar is a mixed blessing, at best.
Purchasing Power
In the basic definition of dollar strength — its worth in other currencies — this has been the dollar’s best year in decades. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar’s value against six major currencies, was up 16.9 percent this year through Thursday, and hovering around its highest levels in 20 years. In direct matchups with the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi, the dollar is, likewise, higher than it has been in years.
This buys you better meals and drinks if you are an American traveling abroad, but it is a hindrance if you are investing in the stock of American multinational companies. Those with the most international exposure are being severely penalized in this bear market.

Consider two subindexes of the S&P 500. The S&P 500 U.S. Revenue Exposure Index, filled with domestic-oriented companies like Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth Group, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase — dropped 12.7 percent this year through Thursday. That’s not good, but it’s far better than the 24.8 percent loss of the S&P 500 Foreign Revenue Exposure Index, which includes Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Tesla, big drivers of stock market returns. On balance, the strong dollar has probably been a drag on investment, even within the United States.
For the economy, in the United States and around the world, the strong dollar has caused pain in many ways, too. A Sept. 29 analysis by Morgan Stanley summarized the effects of the dollar’s appreciation this way: “It takes a toll on economic growth, in particular through depressing the demand for U.S. exports and increasing the attractiveness of foreign goods and services.”
On the plus side, the strong dollar reduces the price of foreign goods in the United States. Inflation here would be worse without it.
So dollar appreciation coincides with the current policy of the Federal Reserve, which is focused on bringing inflation down.
That’s not always been the case. In 2014 and 2015, Federal Reserve officials said they would not raise interest rates precisely because the dollar’s appreciation then was weakening the American economy. And in 2018, during the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pointed out that a weaker dollar would help U.S. companies compete — only to be chided by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, who said the U.S. government “should stick with the strong dollar mantra,” come what may, to protect the Treasury’s “credibility.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
At the moment, Morgan Stanley estimates, current dollar appreciation is adding to the effects of interest rate increases in the United States. The dollar’s rise is roughly equivalent to an increase of about 0.40 percentage points — on top of the 3 percent increases in the federal funds rate already imposed this year by Federal Reserve policymakers. In other words, the appreciating dollar is slowing the rate of inflation in the United States — but increasing it in much of the rest of the world — and doing all of this by weakening the economy both in the United States and around the world.
John Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management, put the conundrum this way: “Dollar strength equates to global currency weakness, fanning inflationary pressures around the world. Consequently, central banks in developed and emerging economies are confronted with the conflicting necessity to raise interest rates to fight inflation and support their currencies, despite weakening economic growth.”
As New York Times colleagues in Asia have pointed out, a rising dollar and a disorderly decline in the value of other currencies caused a global debt crisis 25 years ago, requiring international bailouts. If the dollar keeps rising now, it could disrupt economies in unforeseen ways.
The Heart of Finance
The dollar is the fulcrum of the world’s trading and financial system, a position that it has occupied, with periodic adjustments, since it supplanted the British pound during World War II.
The strongman role of the U.S. currency and the weakness of the British one were on spectacular display this month, when the new British government was compelled to reverse its fiscal policy in response to the cratering of its currency. It abandoned plans to cut taxes for wealthy people largely because the prospect of widening British deficits caused a run on the pound.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Thanks to the central role of the dollar, the U.S. government has been largely immune from such financial pressures when its habitual deficit spending has seemed imprudent to outsiders. In a world crisis — even one emanating from the United States, such as the periodic brinkmanship in Congress over the raising of the U.S. debt ceiling — investors tend to pour their money into the safest assets. Remarkably, even when the United States is causing disruptions, the haven of choice is, for the most part, dollar-denominated Treasuries.
A Formidable Weapon
The dollar’s primacy has always added to American geopolitical power. Now, the dollar is being increasingly used as a weapon against American adversaries.
Most foreign exchange reserves are held in dollars, and more global trade is transacted using dollars than any other currency. That’s given the United States the ability to freeze dollar assets as leverage against other nations, and it has done that through the decades against Cuba, North Korea, Afghanistan, Iran and Venezuela.
But with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its allies sharply escalated the “weaponization of global finance,” according to a recent State Street study, freezing nearly half of the Russian Central Bank’s estimated $630 billion in foreign exchange and gold reserves. The allies have also frozen the assets of individuals and Russian banks, and severely limited Russia’s access to the international payment system, known as SWIFT. Such sanctions are now a standard part of the policymaking playbook, for reasons that have far more to do with political and military power than traditional finance.
The Goldilocks Dollar
Forecasts of the end of the dollar’s role in international finance have been rampant — and wrong — since 1971, when President Richard M. Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, leading the world toward the floating exchange rate system that we now take for granted.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A new backlash against the dollar is developing, and a range of countries, from Russia to China and Saudi Arabia, have been working on alternatives in international finance. Some cryptocurrencies have been promoted as dollar substitutes.
I won’t hazard a prediction, except for these observations.
First, the current high dollar exchange value will surely reverse itself, as it has before, once the Federal Reserve pivots and worries more about economic fragility than inflation. Second, the dollar is slowly losing ground in international finance but until there’s a better option, predictions of its demise will continue to be premature. Third, the weaponization of the dollar is likely to hasten its decline because no country wants a financial system in which it can easily lose access to its own money.
Really, we will all be much better off if we don’t have to think so frequently about the dollar — about its puny purchasing power at home, its exorbitant exchange rate or its use as a potent weapon.
A strong dollar isn’t a sustainable goal. A Goldilocks dollar, one that isn’t overwhelming the world or underwhelming consumers, is."

2022-10-12,"Companies that spend trillions of dollars each year and employ millions of people are reporting financial results in the coming weeks that will provide crucial clues on how the U.S. economy might perform in the months ahead. At a time of great confusion, investors are hoping for some clarity.
Interest rates, which raise costs for companies, have increased since the summer, the last time investors heard from corporate leaders. At the same time, consumer spending and employment have held up, so there is a chance that company earnings will be robust, too.
But many investors are fretting that the Federal Reserve’s determination to tame inflation and cool the economy will have caught up with company performance by now, denting sales and profits in the third quarter. That could prompt companies to lay off workers and cut investment in the coming months, which would increase the chances of a recession in the United States. Others on Wall Street see signs that inflation is beginning to fall, which could lower the likelihood of a downturn and protect companies from big financial hits.
The to and fro of competing narratives highlights the uncertainty that many on Wall Street are experiencing. It has been evident in the stock markets as well. A brief rally to start the month gave way to further selling, as optimism, not for the first time this year, gave way to renewed concern over the outlook for the economy.

“Everyone is trying to get their finger on the pulse of what companies are really experiencing, not just for this quarter but also headed into next year,” said Kate Moore, a strategy head at BlackRock.
Many stock analysts are hoping that the Fed raises rates by just enough to bring down inflation without causing a recession. Such a “soft landing,” if it happens, will protect companies’ bottom lines. Optimism that it could is reflected in at least one data point. Analysts expect earnings for companies in the S&P 500 to grow around 7.5 percent this year and next, according to data from FactSet — an unusually upbeat prediction given that many investors still fear a worsening economic downturn.
“Investors are anticipating tightening monetary policy will cause a recession, whereas the analysts are talking to the companies and getting mostly positive feedback,” said Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, a research firm.
Mr. Yardeni said the economy was experiencing a period of low growth, not a sharp contraction across the board. This, he added, will lead to weak earnings for some companies but not for others.
“For retailers stuck with unintended inventories, it feels like a recession,” he said. “Meanwhile, you go to the airports, you go to restaurants, you go to hotels, and there’s no recession in any of those industries.”

Mr. Yardeni is forecasting that the S&P 500 will be back at its peak by the end of next year. Others are also betting on an improving outlook that will push stock prices higher.
“My view is this quarter won’t be great, for sure, but things will not fall off a cliff,” said Eric Johnston, the head of equity derivatives at Cantor Fitzgerald. “I think it will be in line or better than what people are fearing.”

Part of the reason some analysts are holding out hope for 2023 is that companies have so far not issued their forecasts for next year. That could be because corporate executives do not have a clear picture of what’s going to happen to their businesses next year — and they may not offer many clues this earnings season. One of the few business leaders to speak out is Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who recently predicted that the United States would tip into a recession in the next six to nine months. The International Monetary Fund, in contrast, said on Tuesday that it expected the U.S. economy to grow 1 percent.
Some big companies are already hitting the brakes.
FedEx, expecting less demand for its shipping services, said last month that it was going to cut investment and freeze hiring, and its shares lost a fifth of their value. On Friday, Samsung, the electronics giant, issued preliminary revenue and profit numbers for the third quarter that were below expectations, a sign that demand was waning for its products. And Levi Strauss said on Friday that its sales and earnings would likely grow more slowly than had been expected.

Still, estimates for S&P 500 earnings in 2023 have fallen only 4 percent this year, according to FactSet.
“The confidence level in those estimates has to be almost nil,” said Mike O’Rourke, the chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “Nobody really knows what the environment’s going to look like in 2023.”
Wall Street’s optimism has already been dashed many times this year.
After companies reported better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter, stocks rallied into August. Investors were betting that inflation was easing and that companies would escape largely unscathed from the Fed’s campaign to bring prices down by raising interest rates.
Then, Fed policymakers made it clear that they were far from finished and that inflation remained too high, a point reinforced by economic data in September, which, by the end of the month, had dragged the stock market to new lows. When economic data, like last Friday’s jobs report, continues to suggest that the economy is running hot, the stock market sells off sharply. The S&P 500 has lost nearly a fourth of its value since its peak in January.
Another reason for Wall Street’s jitters is that companies are slipping into an uncertain phase after roughly two years of record profits. During the pandemic, their sales — buoyed by government stimulus payments — were growing fast enough to outpace increases in costs, which led to fat profit margins.

The worry now is that those margins are shrinking because costs are still rising at many companies — higher interest rates, higher wages and hard-to-fix supply chain problems are to blame — even as sales slow down.
When reporting its third-quarter production numbers in early October, Tesla said it had become “increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity, and at a reasonable cost, during these peak logistics weeks.”

The shakeout that investors expect to occur at companies is likely to have a direct impact on their employees. Meta has announced a hiring and budget freeze, and other big names are expected to follow. Some analysts say that the huge hiring spree that companies went on during much of the pandemic has eroded their productivity, by reducing output per employee, and that layoffs will eventually occur.
“Ultimately, they’ll stop adding unproductive workers. There will be job losses, and they’ll restructure their businesses to be more efficient,” said Michael Arone, an investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Because of the pandemic aftershocks and some of the things that are going on, this may take longer than it normally does.”

Investors will be particularly focused on the results and announcements from the large companies whose stocks have helped drive the market to its high.
Because of how stocks in the S&P 500 are weighted, a relatively small number of large companies, including Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, are responsible for much of the index’s decline.
Those companies are important gauges for the economy when it comes to things like hiring and corporate spending, but they are also signals for how benchmark stock indexes will perform in the future. As large, international companies, they reflect the health of the global economy and the effect of a dollar at a two-decade peak.
There is yet another debate on Wall Street: Are most of the dire economic forecasts already reflected in the market?
The more optimistic analysts say stocks are starting to look attractively valued. At Monday’s close, the S&P 500 was trading at 15 times what analysts expect companies in the index to earn next year, a multiple that is not particularly expensive. But if earnings — this quarter and into next year — come in below estimates, the market could fall further. For Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, that’s the more likely outcome.
“I think the path of least resistance is still lower,” Ms. Sonders said.

2022-10-13,"Netflix’s ad tier is here.
The streaming company on Thursday unveiled the details of its big effort to jump-start subscriber growth after the company’s first-quarter revelation that it had lost paying customers for the first time in a decade. Beginning on Nov. 3 in the United States, Netflix will offer a $6.99 advertising-supported subscription called Basic With Ads, a lower-cost option that will show people four to five minutes of ads per hour of content they watch.
This tier will also be available in 11 other countries in November: Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Spain.
The ads, ranging from 15 to 30 seconds, will play before and during television shows and older films. For new films, the ads will play only before the movie begins.
Subscribers opting for this tier will not be able to download titles for later viewing, a prohibition based primarily on technical challenges. Netflix also indicated that “a limited number of movies and TV shows,” somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of those on the service, wouldn’t be available when the ad tier began because of “licensing restrictions.”

“We believe that with this launch we’ll be able to provide a plan and a price for every Netflix fan,” Netflix’s chief operating officer, Greg Peters, said during a presentation to journalists.
Netflix’s current pricing options won’t change. The basic service, without ads, costs $9.99 a month. The most expensive tier, with the highest-definition resolution, is $19.99."

Tesla’s uncertain outlook rattles investors
Investors punished Tesla for cutting its growth forecast on Wednesday, sending shares tumbling nearly 6 percent lower in premarket trading, despite Elon Musk’s efforts to play down worries about slowing demand amid broader worries about the economy and growing competition.
It’s been a drastic fall. Almost a year ago, Tesla raced into the exclusive trillion-dollar club — joining Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet’s Google with market capitalizations in the 13-figure range. Recap: Tesla bulls set off a rally back then after the company’s deal to sell 100,000 cars to Hertz.
On Wednesday, Tesla’s market cap closed at just below $700 billion. Investors continue to fret about recession fears and rising interest rates, which will make car-financing more pricey. Undaunted, Musk told investors that the company would return to those lofty valuations — and even become the world’s most valuable company, bigger than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. “I will not let you down, no matter what it takes,” he added in a tweet.
Investors seem more focused on the here and now, particularly that Tesla missed out on its shipping targets.

Another concern: whether Musk will need to sell shares to finance his roughly $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. He’s already sold about $15.5 billion this year. Musk revealed little about his plans yesterday, but did admit that he’s “obviously overpaying,” for the tech company.
Big Tesla shareholders have been lobbying for a share buyback. Musk addressed this request yesterday, saying a “meaningful buyback” in the $5 billion to $10 billion range could come next year.
In the meantime, Tesla is struggling with the new realities of rising commodity prices and slowing global demand. As The Times’s Neal Boudette reports, the company sold roughly 20,000 fewer cars last quarter than it made, and it narrowly missed analysts’ profit expectations.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Warren Buffett’s favorite banker and a firm backed by Michael Dell team up. BDT, the merchant bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs banker Byron Trott, said it would merge with MSD Capital, an investment firm born from Dell’s family office. Trott, whom Buffett has praised over the years, will be co-C.E.O. of the combined firm with Gregg Lemkau, another former Goldman executive who leads MSD. “We believe strongly that our firms share a common mission and similar cultures,” BDT executives wrote to investors, “which will underpin our efforts to come together and unlock the full capabilities of our combined firm.”

Could market turmoil like Britain’s happen in the U.S.? Officials at the Fed and the White House quizzed investors on whether the kind of market meltdown that affected British government bonds was possible there, The Times reports. The answer: probably, but not imminently.
Britain’s government may be on the brink. Support for Prime Minister Liz Truss appeared to be collapsing, as an increasing number of lawmakers in her own party called for her to step down. Truss has had a torrid 24 hours, including the firing of her home secretary and one lawmaker’s description of her government “as a shambles and a disgrace.”
The Biden administration offers an olive branch to OPEC. The U.S. has quietly assured the oil production cartel that it won’t be subject to the same sort of price caps that the Group of 7 countries are imposing on Russia, Reuters reports. OPEC and Russia teamed up this month to announce drastic cuts to production, drawing President Biden’s public ire.
A federal appeals court undercuts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s reach. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the bureau was unconstitutionally funded, which negated the agency’s ability to regulate payday lending. A spokesman for the agency disputed the ruling, which was made by judges appointed by former President Donald Trump.

The companies having little problem with inflation, so far
On Tuesday, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, seemed to sum up the big fears hanging over the economy when he tweeted his concern about a pending slowdown, warning his 5.3 million Twitter followers to “batten down the hatches.”

One group that seems to be defying that advice: consumer goods giants, which continue to flex their pricing power. Squeezed by higher commodity prices, firms have passed on higher costs to shoppers by raising prices on products like cereal, detergent and diapers.
Consumers have been willing to pay up. Elevating prices to offset costs has enabled the likes of Nestlé and Procter & Gamble — which both reported healthy third-quarter earnings on Wednesday — to beat analysts’ expectations despite selling fewer goods, reports The Times’s Isabella Simonetti. Nestlé, the Swiss maker of Kit Kat, Nespresso coffee capsules and Purina pet food, raised prices by 9.5 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2021, and up from a 7.7 percent price increase in the previous quarter. The U.S.-based Procter & Gamble, whose brands include Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent, raised prices by 9 percent. Last week, PepsiCo disclosed it has increased prices 17 percent on an annualized basis on its snacks and drinks.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The global inflation crisis could sap any short-term gains. P.&G. said it expected a drop in sales for the fiscal year. Nestlé, in contrast, is sticking with its growth forecast. This comes as consumer prices in most advanced economies are rising at or near a 40-year high, even as central banks ratchet up interest rates to rein in inflation. The cost of one essential food staple — bread — has skyrocketed.

A few hours after P.&G. reported results, unnerved investors sent risky assets, including most stocks, lower. “It didn’t help to have Jeff Bezos join the recession chorus,” Quincy Krosby, an equity strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in a client note.
SPAC up against the wall
Dozens of the publicly traded shell companies formed during the SPAC boom are now running out of time to make a deal.
SPACs raise money in the hopes of buying a private company that is looking to go public without a traditional I.P.O. But there’s a catch: SPAC sponsors must complete a deal within one to two years. If they fail to do so, they have to return the money — taking a loss on the millions in fees that go to lawyers, bankers and others who help set up the investment vehicles.
The rocky market and generally lackluster performance of SPACs post-deal have made pulling off an acquisition more difficult. There are 533 SPACs that have raised money from investors still seeking a suitable acquisition. Of those, about 79 will hit their deadline by the end of the year, according to SPACInsider, which calculated the number for DealBook.

“This is for sure an unbelievably difficult period for this market,” said Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who runs SPACInsider. This year, 45 SPACs have liquidated or announced they will, returning as much as $12 billion to their original investors, according to the group. Last month, Chamath Palihapitiya, once a prominent and enthusiastic sponsor of SPACs, announced he was closing two of his deals and giving the money back.
But quitting is about to get more expensive. The Inflation Reduction Act’s 1 percent tax on stock buybacks applies to SPAC liquidations as well. Starting Jan. 1, sponsors will have to pay the tax if they liquidate.
Paradoxically, the SPAC is making a modest comeback. October is on pace to see more SPAC deals than June, July and August combined. But as their clocks run out, SPAC sponsors appear to be getting less picky. Parsec Capital Acquisition Corp. raised $86 million a little over a year ago, and its sponsors were looking for a space-themed merger candidate. This week it found a dance partner: Enteractive Media, which makes videos for casinos and gambling websites.
“My prognosis is far from perfect, but my life is perfect.”

Biden’s newest crackdown on boards
In the latest expansion of its antitrust powers, the Biden administration successfully pushed directors of several companies to step down, after suggesting that they might be violating a seldom-enforced provision of federal competition law.
Among those who stepped down from a board: Larry Illg, who had served at Udemy; Randall Winn, who had been at Definitive Healthcare; Gordon Hunter, who had been at CTS; and Joanne Isham, who had been at Redwire. Three directors at SolarWinds also resigned.
At issue is the idea of interlocking directorates, where people simultaneously serve on the boards of ostensible competitors. The Justice Department cited Section 8 of the Clayton Act — “an important, but underenforced, part of our antitrust laws,” according to Jonathan Kanter of the department’s antitrust division — as a warning to the executives.
“Competitors sharing officers or directors further concentrates power and creates the opportunity to exchange competitively sensitive information and facilitate coordination — all to the detriment of the economy and the American public,” Kanter added. (None of the companies admitted to liability for breaking the law.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The move is also a warning shot against private equity, which Kanter has suggested would be an antitrust target for its efforts to roll up companies in various industries. The former directors at SolarWinds represented the buyout firm Thoma Bravo, which still owns a big stake in the company. (While not a private equity firm, Prosus — where Illg is an executive — is a huge tech investor.)

2022-10-25,"Facing a strong U.S. dollar and weakening personal computer sales, Microsoft on Tuesday reported its slowest growth in five years.
The technology giant posted an 11 percent increase in revenue to $50.1 billion for the three months that ended in September, as profit fell 14 percent to $17.6 billion from a year earlier. The last time revenue growth was this slow was the quarter that ended in March 2017; Microsoft’s revenue has since typically grown 12 percent to 22 percent each quarter.
The results were in line with what Microsoft told investors to expect and included a less favorable foreign currency environment. The war in Ukraine and the economic turmoil in Britain have strengthened the U.S. dollar, depressing revenue by $2.3 billion. Removing the currency fluctuations, Microsoft’s business grew 16 percent.
Microsoft suggested that the difficult conditions might continue when it gave a financial forecast for the current quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. The company’s shares dropped more than 6 percent in after-hours trading.
In the most recent quarter, softness in the global market for new computers, which affects Microsoft’s lucrative Windows business, offset the strength of the company’s cloud computing services and its suite of productivity software like Word, Excel and security offerings. The company said it continued to see healthy demand in its commercial business.
Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, told investors that, in uncertain times, cloud computing helped customers manage the risks of supply chain shortages and energy costs. “We look at this and say, ‘This is a period when cloud is going to gain share,’” he said.

2022-10-26,"Google this week reported a steep decline in profits. Social media companies such as Meta said that advertising sales — the heart of their businesses — have rapidly cooled off. And Microsoft, perhaps the tech industry’s most reliable performer, predicted a slowdown through at least the end of the year.
Tech companies led the way for the U.S. economy over the past decade and buoyed the stock market during the worst days of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, amid stubborn inflation and rising interest rates, even the biggest giants of Silicon Valley are signaling that tough days may be ahead.
The companies are navigating the same problems as the rest of the economy. Pumped up by aggressive consumer spending during the pandemic, they invested to keep up with demand. Now, as that spending is slowing, they’re trying to adjust. It hasn’t been easy.
Amazon, which had 798,000 employees at the beginning of 2020, is reining in expansion of its warehousing operations, mothballing buildings, pulling out of leases and delaying plans to open facilities. The company employed 1.52 million people in the second quarter, almost 100,000 fewer than at the end of March.
Most companies would love to have the problems of the tech industry’s leaders. Between them, Google and Microsoft made $31.5 billion in profits in their most recent quarter. On Thursday Apple is expected to say that it made more than $20 billion in profits in a quarter that will otherwise be considered a disappointment.

Quarterly changes in gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation.

By The New York Times
U.S. economy grows, but slowly
The U.S. economy grew slowly over the summer, adding to fears of a looming recession while simultaneously keeping alive the hope that one might be avoided.
Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, increased by 0.6 percent after six months of decline, slightly exceeding forecasters’ expectations. That suggests that a path to “soft landing,” in which policymakers cool off red-hot demand without snuffing out the recovery entirely, remains open, but narrow.
There are still plenty of economic headwinds. Consumer spending slowed as inflation cut into households’ buying power, and mortgage rates rose to the highest level since 2002, leading to a steep contraction in the housing sector. Big tech companies like Meta and Microsoft, which are usually two drivers of U.S. growth, are also signaling that tough times might be ahead amid inflation.
In Europe: The European Central Bank raised interest rates again. In just three months, the bank has raised rates at the fastest pace in its history.

Ripple effects: Interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve have hurt other currencies — including those of Japan, China and India — by making it harder for foreign borrowers with debt in U.S. dollars to repay their loans.
Quotable: “Ignore the headline number — growth rates are slowing,” Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist for Bank of America, said. “It wouldn’t take much further slowing from here to tip the economy into a recession.”

The war in Ukraine may boost clean energy
In response to natural gas shortages caused by the war in Ukraine, some countries are burning more coal. In the short term, European leaders looking for alternatives to Russian gas are turning to Africa to drill for more fossil fuels.
ADVERTISEMENT

But the International Energy Agency said yesterday that the war could speed up the shift to clean energy rather than slowing it down. One major reason is that soaring fossil fuel prices have led to a wider embrace of wind turbines, solar panels, nuclear power plants, hydrogen fuels, electric vehicles and electric heat pumps.
The I.E.A. said global investment in clean energy is now expected to rise to more than $2 trillion annually by 2030 from $1.3 trillion in 2022.
Still, the shift is not happening fast enough to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. The agency said that for things to change, governments would have to take much stronger action to reduce their emissions over the next few years.

China’s offshore police stations
The Dutch government is investigating reports that Chinese law enforcement agencies are illegally operating offices in the Netherlands to police Chinese citizens overseas.
The recent reports, which come from the news media and a human rights group, add to a growing body of evidence that suggests that Beijing surveils Chinese nationals from overseas outposts. The authorities in Canada are investigating similar operations there, and a rights group said that there are dozens of surveillance outfits around the world — including in New York, Paris, London, Madrid and Toronto.

China said that the operations, which it described as “service stations” meant to help Chinese citizens with administrative tasks like passport renewals, also have the aim of “resolutely cracking down on all kinds of illegal and criminal activities related to overseas Chinese people.”
Reaction: China’s Embassy in the Netherlands said it was “not aware” of and “not involved” with the offices. According to the Vienna Convention, an international pact that both China and the Netherlands signed, administrative matters are to be handled by consulates.

High-stakes talks on Ethiopia
After nearly two years of civil war, representatives from the Ethiopian government and rebel forces in the country’s Tigray region began holding formal peace talks this week.
The failure of the talks could exacerbate a conflict that began when fighting broke out after a contested election, and in which thousands have been killed and millions have been displaced.
Little has emerged so far from the negotiations, which are being held in South Africa and mediated by former African leaders on behalf of the African Union. Tigrayans in exile have said they have little hope that the talks will end the fighting.

“It can’t afford a years’ long war on its borders,” he added. “A collapse in the talks will mean even more carnage in a war that’s already one of the world’s deadliest.”

2022-10-28,"Theodore Roosevelt wasn’t the trust buster that many people believe he was. He believed that giant companies could be more efficient than small ones. Rather than breaking them up, for most of his time in Washington he favored using the power of the presidency to make sure they served the nation.
“Combinations in industry are the result of an imperative economic law which cannot be repealed by political legislation,” Roosevelt said, referring to the concept of economy of scale, in a speech in Osawatomie, Kan., in 1910, when he was out of office. He added: “The effort at prohibiting all combination has substantially failed. The way out lies, not in attempting to prevent such combinations, but in completely controlling them in the interest of the public welfare.”
T.R.’s lack of appetite for antitrust enforcement isn’t just a bit of historical trivia. He was a smart man, a public intellectual, really. The argument he made more than a century ago remains relevant to today’s debates about what to do about corporate giants: Break them up, or regulate them? Instead of Standard Oil and U.S. Steel, we’re talking about Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon — but many of the questions are the same.
The debate over bigness came to a head in 1912 when Roosevelt, who as a Republican had served as president from 1901 to 1909, sought to get back into the White House as the Progressive Party (“Bull Moose”) candidate. He challenged the incumbent Republican president, William Howard Taft; the Democratic candidate, Woodrow Wilson; and the Socialist candidate, Eugene Debs. It may have been the last presidential election in U.S. history in which antitrust policy was a critical issue.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
There’s a 2015 Iowa Law Review article about the 1912 election with the delightful title, “All I Really Need to Know About Antitrust I Learned in 1912.” During the campaign, Roosevelt called Taft a “fathead” and “puzzlewit” and Taft called Roosevelt a “dangerous egoist,” wrote the article’s author, the law professor Daniel Crane of the University of Michigan.
Speaking in San Francisco that September, Roosevelt made the case for control: “There once was a time in history when the limitation of governmental power meant increasing liberty for the people. In the present day the limitation of governmental power, of governmental action, means the enslavement of the people by the great corporations who can only be held in check through the extension of governmental power.”"

Lawsuits on the horizon?

New battle lines over pay and layoffs?
Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter may have closed, but his battle with the company’s board and executives seems to be barreling forward. After what DealBook hears was a bitter closing on Thursday, Musk is taunting Twitter and the law firm it worked with in its lawsuit against him, Wachtell Lipton, with the prospect of litigation, while trying to avoid paying top executives the golden parachutes they’re owed. It appears that fraught legal battles lie ahead, and it’s unclear whether Musk’s aim is to win or simply punish.
“I would not be surprised at all if there are lawsuits involving everything from compensation to people he feels have withheld information illegally from him,” Walter Isaacson, the Musk biographer who shadowed him throughout much of last week, said on CNBC.
Musk is trying to get out of paying senior executives’ golden parachute deals. Here’s how that could shake out: Musk fired the executives purportedly “with cause” in hopes of avoiding payment. But it’s unclear what the cause might be. (Twitter itself has set a high bar for such firings, like unauthorized use of Twitter’s confidential information or pleading guilty to a felony.)
If the Twitter executives sue for the payments, it would likely go to arbitration. Based on the facts we know, it would seem they have a strong case.
The executives would have to pay their own legal costs. They could be reimbursed for at least some of them, as the employment contract of the former C.E.O. Parag Agrawal shows. But Musk could try to get out of that as well.
Musk could go after the board (and possibly executives) for fraud. It might look like this: Musk would sue the directors arguing they defrauded him into buying Twitter, similar to what Hewlett-Packard did in 2015. But Musk would need to prove Twitter materially and intentionally misled him. Simply not telling him things doesn’t count as fraud.
Arguably, if Musk thought he had a strong case for fraud, he would have proceeded with the Delaware trial. The new question becomes: Now that he’s been forced to buy Twitter, how much will he be willing to spend on litigation to punish those he bought it from?
Twitter’s board and key executives are covered by director and officer insurance, which fronts the cost of lawsuits over their management of the company. If they’re found guilty of fraud, however, they would need to repay those fees.
Employees could sue Musk over layoffs. While the timing and scope of layoffs remains fluid, they are on the way. If Musk does mass layoffs before filing a required notice under the WARN Act, employees could sue, as they did at Tesla. (The law requiring the disclosure has exceptions, like unforeseen business circumstances.) If he intentionally laid them off before Tuesday’s stock-vesting date specifically to avoid paying out a bonus, that could be grounds for a suit as well.

BP’s blockbuster quarter spurs calls for more windfall profit taxes. The oil giant’s third-quarter earnings more than doubled to $8 billion, continuing a string of soaring profits for the industry.

Chinese stocks briefly soar on hopes of an end to zero-Covid policies. Shares in Chinese companies jumped nearly 7 percent today amid speculation on social media that Beijing was taking tentative steps to easie tough pandemic policies.

Toyota’s quarterly profit drops 25 percent amid a series of woes.

The Biden administration books big antitrust wins
In recent months, the Biden administration’s more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement has been dealt a series of setbacks. But on Monday, the Justice Department notched two different victories that it can say are vindications of its tougher stance.

A federal judge blocked a book-publishing megamerger, agreeing with the Justice Department that Penguin Random House’s $2 billion takeover of Simon & Schuster might “substantially” harm competition. The case involved an unusual focus by federal prosecutors on the threat to author earnings, instead of harm to consumers: Essentially, it drastically widens the scope of how regulators view consolidation, to include the impact on workers and suppliers.
The three-week trial over the case drew in a who’s who of the publishing industry, including — as a witness for the prosecution — the author Stephen King. (After the verdict, King told The Times he was “delighted with the outcome.”) Penguin Random House and its parent, Bertelsmann, said they planned to appeal.

Blackstone’s D.I.Y. leveraged buyout
Blackstone yesterday struck what is the biggest leveraged buyout deal by a private equity firm so far this year, buying a majority stake in Emerson Electric’s air-conditioning business for $14 billion, including debt. But to get the deal done, it had to do some D.I.Y. financing, illustrating the challenges facing the private equity industry in these tougher times.
The buyout firm and its co-investors will invest $4.4 billion in equity, while Emerson will roll over a 45 percent stake and lend Blackstone $2.25 billion. The big question was how to arrange the remaining $5.5 billion in debt at a time when banks have taken big losses from deal financing — or are set to, as with Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter.
That forced Blackstone to get creative, with the firm raising the debt itself over a matter of weeks rather than hiring banks to arrange everything:
About $2.9 billion in financing came as a term loan from banks who will hold onto the debt (a Term Loan A, for finance geeks) rather than selling it onto investors.
Blackstone sourced the remaining $2.6 billion from an array of private lenders, including an arm of Goldman Sachs and Sixth Street Partners. The Wall Street Journal noted that Blackstone has done this before, notably after the 2008 financial crisis, but never at this scale.
It’s a sign of how tough the L.B.O. business is now. Blackstone boasted that it was uniquely positioned to get the Emerson transaction done: “The size and breadth of our firm gives us the ability to do complicated transactions like this deal in less liquid markets,” Joe Baratta, its global private equity chief, said. But other investment firms may not have the same scale, or might have to pay a lot more to do their deals.

A Fed pivot?

Will the Fed go four for four?
Wednesday is the final meeting of the Fed’s Open Market Committee before next week’s midterm elections, and the central bank’s move on interest rates looks like a foregone conclusion.
The overwhelming consensus is for a fourth-straight increase of 0.75 percentage points, which would bring the prime lending rate close to 4 percent, a level last reached in 2008. The increase would continue the Fed’s effort to douse inflation by raising borrowing costs to reduce consumer demand.
The big question is, what will the central bank do next? Optimism has returned to the markets in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 climbing 8.1 percent last month on hopes of a “Fed pivot” toward smaller rate increases in the future. Investors in Asia and Europe nudged stocks higher this morning, and U.S. futures are flat.
There are competing factors weighing on the Fed. The most persuasive came from Tuesday’s data on job openings and quit rates, known as the JOLTS report, which showed a still-healthy and growing — though slowing — U.S. labor market. Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist for LPL Financial, wrote in a research note that the JOLTS data suggest the U.S. jobs market could withstand further rate increases. (On cue, stocks slumped.)
Meanwhile, left-leaning lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, openly questioned the Fed’s aggressive rate-increase policy, saying its approach reflected “an apparent disregard for the livelihoods of millions of working Americans.”

Don’t expect Jay Powell, the Fed chair, to make bold proclamations. He’s unlikely to declare an end to jumbo-size rate increases in his speech after the Fed decision. Instead, investors will be on alert for subtleties: “Certainly yanking/modifying ‘ongoing increases’ from the statement would be the first clue” that the Fed sees smaller increases in the future, Tom Porcelli, a chief economist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.
Meanwhile, investors will also watch the Bank of England tomorrow, when it convenes its first rate-setting meeting since Rishi Sunak became Britain’s prime minister. Like the Fed, the Bank of England is expected to raise rates by 0.75 percentage points, the biggest increase in 30 years, to bring down torrid inflation and maintain a sense of calm in the markets for British government bonds and the pound.

Benjamin Netanyahu may yet return to power. Interim results from Israel’s election show his Likud party on a path to forming a majority in Parliament.

Rethinking how Twitter makes money
Days into the Elon Musk era at Twitter, the makings of a new business model for the long-embattled social network are taking shape. The company’s new owner is pressing ahead with a subscription offering, which Musk has repeatedly emphasized is a necessary new source of revenue.
But its importance has also seemingly grown as more advertisers have said they are at least temporarily stepping back amid worries about widening chaos on the platform.

A key Musk focus is an $8-a-month Twitter Blue service. As currently envisioned, subscribers would receive the “verified” check-mark badge, see fewer ads, be ranked higher in replies to others’ tweets, be able to share longer videos and bypass paywalls at news publishers that partner with Twitter.

Twitter is also reportedly rushing out a service that would let users charge others to see content like video, according to The Washington Post; the feature has raised internal concerns about copyright infringement and other legal issues.
Will users pay for Twitter Blue? Supporters of the move point to other social networks, like LinkedIn and Snap, that charge users for additional features. And some organizations, like the newsletter publisher Puck, said they would fork over the fees to keep their employees verified.
But others point out that verification is meant at least in part to, well, verify that the Twitter user is authentic, and paying to get a check mark defeats that purpose. Check marks will also effectively turn subscribers’ prioritized tweets into paid advertisements for Twitter Blue, which could turn off actual advertisers that want their ads to appear next to organically popular content, Slate argues.
We’d also ask: How much money would subscriptions bring in? “It won’t be the majority of people, but there’s a small base of people that will” subscribe, the analyst Rich Greenfield told The Wall Street Journal. But given that Twitter’s own internal research from before the Musk deal closed purportedly showed a drop in activity among power users, it’s unclear how much Twitter Blue would add to a top line that hit $5 billion last year.

And though Musk flew to New York this week to allay advertising executives’ fears over content moderation, the ad giant IPG has joined the firms advising clients to temporarily suspend campaigns on the platform over just that.

The trillion-dollar club gets smaller
The great tech rout of 2022 continued on Tuesday as Amazon, a bellwether tech stock, fell 5.5 percent on fears about the slowing global economy and rising interest rates sapping consumer demand. In the past year, investors have dumped shares in Amazon, erasing about $700 billion from its market valuation.

Amazon is the third tech stock to crash out of the trillion-dollar club this year. Meta Platforms, Facebook’s parent company, is down 71 percent for the year, and is now valued at $252 billion, while Tesla is down nearly 42 percent and has a market cap of $719 billion. Only Apple, the Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft still have thirteen-digit valuations.
A reminder: Andy Jassy, who took over as Amazon C.E.O. last year, will join Andrew to discuss the future of its business at the DealBook Summit on Nov. 30.

Tallying the “Dobbs effect” for start-ups
After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, start-ups focused on women’s health seized the moment to rally supporters of abortion rights. There are now emerging signs that investment dollars for these companies — which for years have been largely neglected by venture capitalists — are growing in the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson.
“Something changed,” Elizabeth Bailey, a managing director of the women’s health-focused venture firm RH Capital, told DealBook. RH Capital this week closed its oversubscribed second fund at $38.5 million — with more than a quarter of that amount coming in the few months after the Dobbs decision. “We simply had not seen that momentum previously,” Bailey added.
That said, some women’s health start-ups, particularly those focused on abortion access, are still reporting difficulties. The co-founder of Hey Jane, which provides abortion pills and which recently raised $6.1 million in new funding, said last month that many potential investors were wary of being entangled in politics.

Overall investment in women’s health start-ups is coming off a low baseline. Global investment in so-called “femtech” companies crossed $1 billion for the first time just last year, according to PitchBook. (Female-founded companies overall received only 2.4 percent of the nearly $330 billion of U.S. venture capital invested last year.)
Among the reasons for the low numbers is the historical dearth of female venture investors, leading mostly male-led firms to ignore start-ups focused on women’s health and concerns. Still, the trend lines are improving, as more women rise in the venture capital industry and investors recognize the market potential of femtech and related industries. “We are at least seeing things moving in the right direction,” Bailey said.

2022-11-03,"SAN FRANCISCO — The technology industry’s slowdown came into even sharper relief on Thursday as Amazon publicly said it had paused hiring for its corporate work force and several other technology companies announced job cuts.
Amazon said senior executives decided this week to pause incremental corporate hiring because the economy was “in an uncertain place.” The move added to a freeze from last month, when the e-commerce giant halted corporate and technology hiring in its retail business for the rest of the year.
“We anticipate keeping this pause in place for the next few months, and will continue to monitor what we’re seeing in the economy and the business,” said Beth Galetti, the Amazon executive in charge of human resources, in a note posted internally and on the company’s blog.
At the same time, Lyft said it would cut 13 percent of its employees, or about 650 of its 5,000 workers. Stripe, a payment processing platform, said it would cut 14 percent of its employees, roughly 1,100 jobs.

Tech giants including Meta and Amazon have been slowing down their hiring for months, while smaller tech companies such as Robinhood and Coinbase have announced layoffs. But rarely have so many job cuts and hiring freezes in the industry been disclosed on the same day.
Tech companies have led the way for the U.S. economy over the past decade, lifting the stock market during the worst days of the coronavirus pandemic. But in recent weeks, many of the largest firms reported financial results that suggested they were feeling the impact of global economic jitters, soaring inflation and rising interest rates.
Social media companies in particular have been grappling with a pullback in digital advertising over the last few months. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said last week that its head count would remain “roughly flat” through the end of next year. The company plans to shrink some teams and hire only for high-priority areas. Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, laid off 20 percent of its employees in August, blaming challenging macroeconomic conditions.
Last week, Microsoft told investors that new hires in this quarter “should be minimal.” Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, also said that in this quarter it would hire fewer than half the number of people it added in the third quarter.
Amazon cautioned investors that revenue growth this quarter could weaken to the slowest pace in two decades, which includes the critical holiday shopping season. After doubling its work force in 2020 and 2021, Amazon has shrunk since the start of this year. The company employed 1.5 million people at the end of the third quarter.

More layoffs at tech companies are in the works. Elon Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion last week, has ordered cuts across the company, which employs about 7,500 people. Workers at Twitter have started circulating a “Layoff Guide” with tips on how to handle being laid off.
On Thursday, Lyft said it had decided on layoffs in the face of “a probable recession sometime in the next year.” All teams will be affected, said Logan Green and John Zimmer, the company’s founders, in an email to employees.
“It was important to take these proactive actions to ensure we can accelerate execution, stay focused on the best opportunities to drive profitable growth and deliver strong business results,” Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer wrote.
Over the summer, Lyft cut 2 percent of its employees, mostly as a result of shutting down its car rental business, and froze hiring. But the company still has “to become leaner,” its founders said. It is “not immune to the realities of inflation and a slowing economy,” which have led to increasing ride-share insurance costs.
Lyft also said it planned to sell its first-party vehicle service business and expected employees on that team to be offered jobs at the acquiring company.

Patrick Collison, a co-founder and the chief executive of Stripe, said the company had hired too many people and spent too quickly on its operations during the pandemic, only to be confronted this year by inflation, high interest rates, climbing energy costs and declining start-up funding.
“We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth,” he said in an email to employees, adding that the company “underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown.”
The layoffs will not happen evenly, Mr. Collison added. Teams like recruiting will be trimmed more heavily because the company will hire fewer people next year. Stripe lowered its internal valuation by 28 percent to $74 billion in July.

To understand the importance and consequences of Tuesday’s midterm elections, I spoke to Astead Herndon, a political reporter who has been covering this election cycle for the Times podcast “The Run-Up.”
Claire: Hi Astead. I live in Europe, where many people are only now starting to tune into the midterms. How would you explain to them, and others who need a refresher, why this election matters?
Astead: If the Republicans take back the House, it would change the scope of U.S. policy. We know they’d try to stop President Biden’s agenda. A Republican House would hurt Biden’s ability to respond to domestic challenges on his terms, like inflation, and to global crises — Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House leader, has signaled that Republicans might stop approving aid for Ukraine.
We’ve also seen a global rise in fears of democratic collapse. If the U.S. elects lawmakers who spread conspiracy theories about elections and who promise to tear down tenets of democracy, that will embolden autocratic leaders in other countries and weaken the United States’ standing in the world.
These midterms also matter because they could signal the start of an even more divisive era of politics. We should not assume we are at the floor of division — we’re going to get lower.

When you say Republicans would try to block Biden, what could that look like?
If Republicans take over Congress, some members will push their new House speaker to start impeachment proceedings of the president and members of his cabinet like Merrick Garland, the attorney general. Some Republicans have been ready to impeach Biden since he took office. Their complaints are about policy and politics, not accusations of the kinds of abuses of power that have historically been grounds for impeachment. McCarthy has tried to minimize talk of impeachment lately, seeing it as polarizing, but the hard right rank-and-file will almost certainly press for it.
You’ve been covering politics for years. What do you think we should be paying more attention to?
Democrats are asking their base to rally behind the idea of protecting democracy — that’s what Biden has said. But that base is mostly working-class Americans and people of color. And many of those people feel like the system has not provided tangible and meaningful change on issues that most affect their day-to-day life — like housing, wages or public safety.
A woman on last week’s episode of “The Run-Up” told us that democracy has never worked for her. She’s borne the brunt of poverty. Her top issue was housing. That’s not what the Democratic Party is talking about. While Biden and Democrats did pass funding related to housing, that money was drastically cut from the levels that most people who focus on the issue say was necessary to effect lasting change.
I also think that the media has done too little to explain Republicans’ built-in advantages. Their control of legislatures in some battleground states is backed by gerrymandering. We recently did an episode of the podcast about Wisconsin, and how Republicans have gerrymandered the state legislature in such a way that they have effectively shut Democrats out of power.

There are so many races that it can be hard to keep track. Which are worth following?
It depends on what matters to you. Let’s say it’s action from the White House on codifying abortion rights into federal law: Look at races where Democratic control of the House hangs in the balance, and Senate races in states like Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia. If Democrats don’t hold both chambers of Congress, that’s not going to happen.
If your concern is about the strength of democracy, look at state races, like for governor, secretary of state and statehouses — especially with the looming Supreme Court case that could give more power over elections to state legislatures. You can also look at Wisconsin and Arizona, where there are huge stakes, not just for this election but for the Democrats’ ability to win future races. The Republican candidates for governor in those states, Tim Michels in Wisconsin and Kari Lake in Arizona, have been openly hostile toward elements of our election system — including mail-in ballots and early voting — that many Democrats say are necessary for them to have a chance at success.
When might we know some results?
The initial numbers may give us hints of larger trends. In 2016 and 2020, results in Florida gave us good signs of the level of enthusiasm of particular voting blocs. If the Republicans win Florida by a lot, that’ll be a bad sign for Democrats. The margins of Virginia, for example, could tell us whether young, college-educated white voters are going back to Republicans, because they make up a sizable chunk of voters there. But for a lot of results, we will have to wait for the total count, which might take days.

A humbling downfall for Sam Bankman-Fried.

Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times
A crypto giant’s fate is in doubt
Devastation in the crypto market continued on Wednesday, after the giant crypto exchange Binance announced a bombshell deal to buy its embattled rival, FTX. (The deal excludes FTX’s American operations.) The entire market’s capitalization now stands at $900 billion, down from $3 trillion just one year ago, while major cryptocurrencies were down by double-digit percentages. The damage is largely contained within crypto; both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed up yesterday.
But investors fear that Binance won’t go through with the rescue plan, and that more pain awaits after their industry’s biggest Lehman-esque moment to date.
What happened? Binance, an early investor in FTX turned rival, said over the weekend that it planned to sell its holdings in FTT, a token used for trading on FTX’s platform — a stunning move that cast doubt on the financial health of FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research. The token’s value has plunged by roughly 80 percent in the past 36 hours to just under $5.
Image
Traders withdrew over $1.2 billion from FTX on Monday alone, according to the research firm Nansen. By Tuesday, FTX had stopped processing withdrawals; its chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was reportedly casting about for a financial lifeline from billionaires, finally turned to Binance for salvation.

Binance has cemented its dominance over crypto. It was already the largest exchange worldwide for digital currencies and derivatives; FTX’s trading volumes in September were just a fraction of Binance’s. Its founder, Changpeng Zhao — widely known as CZ — showed off his power by effectively kneecapping FTX and then swooping in with a rescue. “This elevates Zhao as the most powerful player in crypto,” Ilan Solot of the derivatives trader Marex Solutions told The Financial Times.
It’s a humbling downfall for Bankman-Fried, who in just three years rocketed from obscurity to become one of the best-known moguls in crypto, earning comparisons to Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan. Months ago, Bankman-Fried sought to live up to the Morgan comparison, swooping in to bail out troubled crypto companies like Celsius and Voyager Digital (deals whose status is now unclear); he also became a frequent presence in Washington, calling for more regulation of the crypto industry, to the ire of CZ and other executives.
At the beginning of the year, FTX was valued at $32 billion, backed by heavyweight investors like BlackRock, SoftBank and Tiger Global. (Investors said yesterday they were blindsided by the deal.) The 30-year-old Bankman-Fried — known in the crypto world as S.B.F. — was said to have a net worth of over $16 billion. But a document leaked to CoinDesk purportedly showed that FTX and Alameda, whose finances had long been murky, were highly illiquid and financially vulnerable.
The crypto world fears other shoes will drop. Investors worry that CZ may yet pull out of his rescue deal: He noted on Tuesday that the transaction was nonbinding and subject to due diligence. Meanwhile, tokens associated with FTX, including Solana, have continued to plunge in value.
Other crypto players sought to distance themselves from the FTX meltdown. Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, the biggest U.S.-focused exchange, said FTX’s troubles appeared to arise from “risky business practices” that his company doesn’t engage in. Still, Coinbase shares fell nearly 11 percent yesterday.
And regulators say the news justifies more scrutiny of crypto companies. “This is a major market event for the digital asset sector,” said Joe Rotunda of the Texas State Securities Board Enforcement Division, which had already been investigating FTX.

The red wave that wasn’t
Republicans haven’t quite had the night they expected. As of 7 a.m. Eastern, Republicans were 21 seats shy of retaking control of the House. But leadership of the Senate remains up in the air after the Democrats flipped a seat in Pennsylvania. Here are the big highlights so far:
Pennsylvania: John Fetterman, the state’s Democratic lieutenant governor, beat Mehmet Oz in the closely watched Senate race. Political analysts now say Democrats need to win two of three hotly contested Senate races — in Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all currently held by Democrats — to maintain power in the chamber.
Georgia: The Senate contest looks like it’s headed for a runoff on Dec. 6, pitting the incumbent, Raphael Warnock, against his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker.
Governor races: Voters backed high-profile incumbents, including Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York; Greg Abbott, Republican of Texas; and Tony Evers, Democrat of Wisconsin.
Ballot initiatives: Voters in Michigan approved making abortion access a right protected under the State Constitution. Those in Maryland and Missouri voted to legalize marijuana, though similar measures were rejected in Arkansas and North Dakota.
A rough night for Donald Trump: Several candidates that he endorsed, including in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, lost or were behind. And a potential rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, handily won re-election.

Meta slices through its work force
Facebook’s owner Meta will lay off 11,000 employees, equivalent to 13 percent of its work force, the company announced on Wednesday morning, in the biggest restructuring in the social media giant’s history. A slump in digital advertising and ballooning losses from its pivot to the metaverse have pushed the company to make a series of wide-ranging cuts.

In a note to employees, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s co-founder and C.E.O., admitted that the company had hired too aggressively during the pandemic as homebound consumers spent more time socializing and shopping online. Meta mistakenly assumed this trend would continue: “I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,” he wrote.
The company has begun cutting costs across its operations, “scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint,” Zuckerberg wrote. The stock was up 3.7 percent in premarket trading, outperforming the Nasdaq.
The economic downturn is forcing companies across industries to shrink. Citigroup and Barclays are expected to lay off hundreds in their investment banking units, Bloomberg reports. And, according to Protocol, Salesforce could cut as many as 2,500 positions in the coming weeks as the activist investor Starboard Value seeks big changes in corporate strategy.
Exclusive: Keurig Dr Pepper buys stake in Athletic Brewing
Keurig Dr Pepper has invested $50 million in Athletic Brewing, the nonalcoholic beer company, as part of a $75 million fund-raise by Athletic, DealBook is first to report. It’s the beverage giant’s second foray into the nonalcoholic booze category — it announced a deal to acquire a nonalcoholic cocktail brand called Atypique this summer — and another sign of interest in this fast-growing category.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Athletic Brewing was founded in 2017 by Bill Shufelt, a former trader at the hedge fund Point72, and John Walker, a former craft brewer. It now sells its products — including lager, light beer and sparkling water — at retailers like Trader Joe’s. With its new backer, Athletic is looking to expand in Australia, France and Spain.
Sales of nonalcoholic beer are skyrocketing, growing almost 70 percent between 2016 and 2021 in the U.S., to about $670 million, according to Euromonitor. While that is still a tiny portion of the overall beer market, its popularity stands in stark contrast to overall sluggishness in beer sales, as the younger generation drinks less and cares more about its waistline. Beer giants like Heineken, Budweiser and Sam Adams have released nonalcoholic alternatives in the last five years.
It’s not just for recovering alcoholics or nondrinkers. Shufelt said 80 percent of his customers drink alcohol, and three-fourths are between the ages of 21 and 44. About half are women, he added.

1. Inflation cooled more than expected, in welcome news for the Fed and President Biden.
Consumer prices rose 7.7 percent in the year through October, according to data released today. The figure is 0.2 percent lower than what analysts had projected and down from the 8.2 percent increase recorded in the year through September. Some saw this as evidence that the Federal Reserve’s campaign to tame inflation was working.
The data offered evidence of a meaningful slowdown: On a monthly basis, “core” inflation, which strips out food and fuel, showed prices climbing just 0.3 percent between September and October, the slowest rise since September 2021. Stocks rallied on the news: The S&P 500 rose 5.5 percent on the day, its best single-day performance since April 2020.
Polls suggested that inflation would play a decisive role in the midterm elections. But after Democrats appeared to overcome economic headwinds, President Biden said he would not change his economic approach. Wall Street, for its part, tends to like a divided government.

2. Control of the House rests on a knife’s edge as the Senate focus shifts to Georgia.
Roughly 48 hours after election polls began closing, more than 30 House races remained uncalled, with a narrow majority in reach for both parties. Republicans have won or are leading in 221 districts — three more than the number needed to retake the chamber — but Democrats remain fewer than 5,000 votes behind in four races.
Control of the Senate will likely take longer to determine than that of the House. In Nevada, where Adam Laxalt, a Republican, narrowly leads the incumbent Democrat, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, election officials will announce a final vote count next week. In Arizona, Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat, has maintained a lead over Blake Masters.
And in Georgia, Senator Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, are heading back on the campaign trail before a runoff on Dec. 6.

3. Both parties try to dissect how Democrats defied conventional political wisdom.
Many Democrats worried that their messages on the economy and crime did not adequately address voter anxieties. But two issues helped them pull away with unexpected victories: abortion and democracy. In states where the issues were central, Democrats outperformed expectations, despite a less-than-popular president.
After a “red wave” failed to materialize, Republicans tried to figure out who was to blame. “Republicans have followed Donald Trump off the side of a cliff,” one longtime Trump adviser told The Times. Many conservative media figures, including in Rupert Murdoch’s news outlets, also pointed the finger at Trump; one called him “the most profound vote repellent in modern American history.”

4. The top U.S. general suggests that it may be time for peace talks in Ukraine.
Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that more than 200,000 Russian and Ukrainian troops had been killed or wounded during the war in Ukraine — more than 100,000 on each side — in addition to roughly 40,000 Ukrainian civilians.
Milley added that the coming winter months, when a lull in fighting is expected, could be an opportunity for both sides to consider peace talks. However, the prevailing U.S. and European opinion is that the two countries are far from such negotiations.

5. Biden is flying to Egypt tonight to address the U.N. climate summit. His message may not be what the world is looking for.
Though Biden is expected to hail his major new climate law in his address tomorrow, he may not have a receptive audience: Developing nations have spent all week excoriating industrialized nations for causing climate change, and demanding reparations.
And while some European leaders have begun to commit funds toward averting “loss and damage” from climate change, their American counterparts have been hesitant to discuss money. If Republicans ultimately control the House after the midterm elections, they may be able to stop Biden from following through with additional climate aid.

Ukraine moves forward in south
The Ukrainian Army is moving cautiously into areas abandoned by Russian troops along a front line in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, a day after Russia’s defense minister announced a retreat from the western bank of the Dnipro River. The move marked a significant setback for Russia’s military; in September it declared parts of the region Russian land.
Heavy fighting continues in some places, but the Ukrainian advance into Snihurivka, an important hub north of Kherson City that was abandoned overnight, indicates that the Russians are, indeed, retreating. Ukrainian officials had initially feared a ruse in the Russian announcement of a pullback, which followed days of enigmatic declarations from the occupying authorities.
Ukraine’s military yesterday said it had advanced into 100 square miles of land in the past 24 hours and had reclaimed 12 towns and villages. “The enemy is regrouping and taking measures to partially withdraw troops to the left bank of the Dnipro,” the military said in a statement, referring to the river’s eastern bank, where the Russian military has been building defenses.
International pressure: A disagreement has emerged at the highest levels of the U.S. government over whether to press Ukraine to seek a diplomatic end to the war, with America’s top general urging negotiations, while other advisers to President Biden argue that it is too soon.

Emissions set to rise year-over-year
Global fossil fuel emissions will most likely reach record highs in 2022 and do not yet show signs of declining, researchers said. Nations are projected to emit roughly 36.6 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide by burning coal, natural gas and oil for energy, up 1 percent from 2021 and slightly more than the previous record in 2019.
The findings were released this week at the U.N. climate change summit in Egypt. Scientists have warned that the world as a whole will need to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by around midcentury to stabilize global temperatures and minimize the risks from deadly heat waves, sea-level rise and ecosystem collapse.
A few countries account for the majority of the world’s fossil fuel emissions, with China responsible for 32 percent, the U.S. 14 percent, the E.U. 8 percent and India 8 percent. In Europe, emissions are expected to drop by about 0.8 percent this year, largely driven by a steep fall in natural gas consumption after Russia cut off supplies.

Analysis: “Every year that emissions go up makes it that much more challenging to bring them back down again by a certain date,” said Glen Peters, a research director at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, who is one of more than 100 scientists involved in the research.

Fresh questions for France’s far right
Grégoire de Fournas, a member of France’s National Assembly from the far-right National Rally, received the harshest possible penalty after interrupting a Black colleague’s speech about shipwrecked migrants in the Mediterranean by shouting, “Back to Africa!”
Whether the target of the outburst last week was his colleague, Carlos Martens Bilongo, or the boat carrying the migrants is in dispute. But the remark, which the body’s president determined to be racist no matter whom it was referring to, has highlighted ongoing issues for the National Rally, as the nationalist party seeks to sanitize its image.
The National Rally, now France’s largest opposition party, has for years attempted to move beyond its narrow anti-immigrant appeals and break out of the fringes of French politics. That effort had mostly been working. But this episode violated strict internal orders to its members to “behave irreproachably” in Parliament, where they have tried hard to blend in.

‘The Crown’ returns to a changed Britain
The fifth season of “The Crown,” the Netflix series about British royals, has been released at a pivotal moment for the monarchy and for Britain. Queen Elizabeth II died two months ago, and weeks of political and economic tumult this fall led to the downfall of Liz Truss and the ascent of Rishi Sunak, the country’s third prime minister since July.
Now, Britain is divided over how the show, which returned this week, depicts the queen and the country’s thorny recent history.
Several prominent figures who are depicted in the show, including the former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major, have publicly denounced the season. The actress Judi Dench said the series was, at times, “cruelly unjust to the individuals and damaging to the institution they represent” and suggested a disclaimer be added to every episode.
“The series is now depicting events that many people in Britain lived through and can remember,” Sarah Lyall, a former London correspondent for The Times, said. “The question of how ‘true’ it all is has become a much more resonant issue.”

2022-11-12,"BALI, Indonesia — Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen on Saturday called for stabilizing the United States’ rocky relationship with China and reopening regular lines of communication between the world’s two largest economies ahead of a global gathering next week where their leaders are expected to meet.
Ms. Yellen’s comments came as she prepared to meet with Yi Gang, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the Group of 20 leaders summit on Monday in Bali, where President Biden is expected to meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. It will be the first in-person meeting between Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi since the president took office last year, a period in which ties between the nations further deteriorated.
“I think stabilizing the relationship and trying to get it on a better footing while recognizing that we have a whole range of concerns, and we would like to address those,” Ms. Yellen said on Saturday in an interview with The New York Times aboard her flight to Indonesia when asked how the relationship could be improved.
America’s relationship with China frayed considerably during the Trump administration, when President Donald J. Trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese imports. Soon after a deal to end the impasse was struck in late 2019, the coronavirus started to spread around the world and Mr. Trump blamed China for its emergence.

Despite the Biden administration’s less outwardly confrontational tone, relations with China have worsened in the past two years. The White House in October unveiled sweeping export restrictions to block China from gaining access to critical technology on national security grounds, and it has declined to roll back the remaining tariffs that were enacted by Mr. Trump.
Hostilities were inflamed this year when Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan amid concern in the United States that China was planning to forcibly reclaim the island, which operates independently. China insists that Taiwan is part of its territory and cannot exist as a sovereign nation.
White House officials said this week that Mr. Biden would discuss Taiwan, trade, human rights and North Korea when he meets with Mr. Xi.
Because of strict pandemic travel restrictions that China has put in place to contain the virus, the few meetings between American and Chinese officials since 2020 have been virtual. Ms. Yellen, who has publicly said that some of the tariffs were “not strategic” and should be rolled back, believes that the source of the tension between the two countries is rooted in the misconception in China that the United States is trying to hobble its economy.
“They need to understand, for example, why we take actions,” Ms. Yellen said. “I know their concern, for example, about our policies of banning sales of advanced semiconductors,” she said, referring to the new sweeping restrictions on exporting technology to China.

She added, “It’s important for us to explain why we’re doing things, how it’s delineated, that it’s not an attempt to completely paralyze China’s economy and stop its development.”
Despite Ms. Yellen’s hopes for better relations, she has in the past criticized China publicly.
In the spring, Ms. Yellen publicly urged China to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine and warned that its reputation as a global economic power could be eroded if it helped Russia evade sanctions. Ms. Yellen said that she was not certain if China had tried persuade Russia to retreat, but that she did not believe that China was evading U.S. sanctions.
This week, while traveling in India, Ms. Yellen promoted Biden administration’s policy of “friend-shoring” and urged India and other allied nations to diversify their supply chains away from China.
In a speech at Microsoft’s offices near New Delhi, the Treasury secretary highlighted China’s problematic human rights record and praised Apple for shifting some of its iPhone manufacturing from China to India. She also lauded investments that have allowed an American solar manufacturer to set up operations in India instead of China, noting that solar panel materials produced in China’s Xinjiang region are made with forced labor.
The Treasury Department has also been critical of China for obfuscating its foreign exchange practices. In a report on global foreign exchange practices this past week, the United States kept China on its list of countries that it watches closely.

“China’s failure to publish foreign exchange intervention and broader lack of transparency around key features of its exchange rate mechanism make it an outlier among major economies and warrants Treasury’s close monitoring,” the report said.
Ms. Yellen said that her meeting on Monday with Mr. Yi, the central bank governor, would be informal and that they would most likely discuss macroeconomic issues. She hopes that more communication about their mutual concerns will improve the bilateral relationship.
“We have national security concerns and if our policies are having unintended consequences more broadly for China, it’s important to be able to hear what their concerns are and potentially to respond to those,” Ms. Yellen said. “We have concerns about their economic practices as well.”"
2022-11-13,"Joel Gindo thought he could finally own and operate the farm of his dreams when a neighbor put up 160 acres of cropland for sale in Brookings County, S.D., two years ago. Five thousand or six thousand dollars an acre should do the trick, Mr. Gindo estimated.
But at auction, Mr. Gindo watched helplessly as the price continued to climb until it hit $11,000 an acre, double what he had budgeted for.
“I just couldn’t compete with how much people are paying, with people paying 10 grand,” he said. “And for someone like me who doesn’t have an inheritance somewhere sitting around, a lump sum of money sitting around, everything has to be financed.”
What is happening in South Dakota is playing out in farming communities across the nation as the value of farmland soars, hitting record highs this year and often pricing out small or beginning farmers. In the state, farmland values surged by 18.7 percent from 2021 to 2022, one of the highest increases in the country, according to the most recent figures from the Agriculture Department. Nationwide, values increased by 12.4 percent and reached $3,800 an acre, the highest on record since 1970, with cropland at $5,050 an acre and pastureland at $1,650 an acre.
A series of economic forces — high prices for commodity crops like corn, soybeans and wheat; a robust housing market; low interest rates until recently; and an abundance of government subsidies — have converged to create a “perfect storm” for farmland values, said Jason Henderson, a dean at the College of Agriculture at Purdue University and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
As a result, small farmers like Mr. Gindo are now going up against deep-pocketed investors, including private equity firms and real estate developers, prompting some experts to warn of far-reaching consequences for the farming sector.

2022-11-14,"Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, said he would give away most of his money to charity, making him the latest billionaire to pledge to donate his vast fortune during his lifetime.
Mr. Bezos is the world’s fourth-richest person, worth $124 billion, according to Bloomberg. In an interview with CNN released on Monday, Mr. Bezos, appearing with his girlfriend, the former television anchor Lauren Sanchez, said they were making preparations “to be able to give away this money.”
He said he wanted to give in a way that maximized the impact of the donations. “It’s really hard,” he said. “And there are a bunch of ways, I think, that you could do ineffective things.”
It was the first time that Mr. Bezos announced that he would give away the bulk of his wealth. More than 230 of the richest people in the world have promised to donate their money to charitable causes as part of the Giving Pledge, a philanthropy movement started in 2010.
ADVERTISEMENT

At least as far back as the 19th-century financier George Peabody, many ultrawealthy Americans have given away large shares of their fortunes. Andrew Carnegie famously wrote in his influential 1889 treatise, “The Gospel of Wealth,” that “the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” Like Mr. Bezos at Amazon, Carnegie was frequently criticized for the labor conditions at his company.
The New York Times reported on Monday that Amazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company’s history. Mr. Bezos’ wealth, which as recently as last year was more than $200 billion, according to Bloomberg, has fallen by tens of billions, on paper, because it is closely tied to Amazon’s share price, which has suffered along with other technology stocks this year.
Mr. Bezos, who is the executive chairman of Amazon, stepped down as chief executive in 2021 when he said his goal was “have the time and energy” to focus on his philanthropy and other pursuits. Mr. Bezos also owns The Washington Post and has his own space travel company, Blue Origin.
On Saturday, Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez announced a $100 million grant for the singer and philanthropist Dolly Parton to direct to her chosen charitable causes, as part of an annual gift called the Bezos Award for Courage and Civility. Before Ms. Parton, $100 million awards were given to the chef José Andrés and the CNN commentator and activist Van Jones, announced by Mr. Bezos at the news conference after his trip in July 2021 aboard a rocket sent to outer space by Blue Origin.
In 2020, Mr. Bezos pledged to give $10 billion to combat climate change as part of the Bezos Earth Fund. As part of that commitment, Mr. Bezos pledged $2 billion to restore natural habitats and transform food systems at the climate summit in Glasgow last year. Previously, Mr. Bezos’ largest donation was a $2 billion gift to help homeless families and start preschools.

Mr. Bezos did not give many details in the CNN interview about how he would donate money, but his past efforts might provide some clues, said Stacy Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
“This is a giant statement, not just because of the amount of wealth he has, but because he might really have a ripple effect on what others choose to do,” Ms. Palmer said.
But Mr. Bezos’ comment about giving away his fortune was “not a binding promise,” said Maribel Morey, a philanthropy expert and founding executive director of the Miami Institute for the Social Sciences. “We run to make news of promises, but we actually don’t know if that’s going to materialize.”
In 1999, the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife at the time, Melinda French Gates, helped usher in a new era of billionaire philanthropy with enormous donations to their namesake foundation. Their close friend Warren E. Buffett, the prominent investor, announced in 2006 that he would give a significant slice of his Berkshire Hathaway shares, valued at the time at $31 billion, to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The three then started the Giving Pledge, where billionaires promise to give away at least half their fortunes, as a way to encourage greater generosity among the world’s richest people.
Other signatories have included Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor of New York; Mr. Gates’s Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen; and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan. There are 236 pledgers across 28 countries, according to the Giving Pledge’s website.

Mr. Bezos has been criticized for not signing the Giving Pledge. His ex-wife, the author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, signed the pledge in 2019 after their divorce, vowing to “keep at it until the safe is empty.”
Ms. Scott, who is estimated by Bloomberg to be worth $24 billion, has already met the Giving Pledge threshold by giving away more than half her fortune — and she has done it in less than three and half years since first publishing her promise on the group’s website.
She has donated more than $14 billion to causes ranging from education to mental health. Ms. Scott, who recently filed for divorce from her second husband, has given to more than 1,500 groups.
Ms. Scott’s rapid, prolific giving is at times compared with Mr. Bezos’ own philanthropy, often to his detriment. Last month, Mr. Bezos visited the Vatican to receive a philanthropy award even though, many observers noted, his ex-wife had given away more money than he had. Unlike Mr. Bezos, who appears at events and gives speeches highlighting his giving, Ms. Scott has maintained a low profile, refusing all interviews on the subject and restricting her comments to essays that she posts on the website Medium.
On Monday, Ms. Scott released her latest essay, noting that over the past seven months she had given nearly $2 billion to 343 organizations. Some of those gifts, like $122.6 million to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, had been previously announced. Others, like a $15 million gift to the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, were first revealed in the post. Like many of her gifts, the donation to the 83-year-old nonprofit group, which supports refugees and migrants entering the United States, was the largest in its history.
Ms. Scott began her latest essay with a poem by Gwen Nell Westerman that she said “inspires me by shutting me up every time I read it.”"
2022-11-15,"Disheveled, young and exceedingly brainy, Sam Bankman-Fried perfectly fit the role of a Silicon Valley mogul in the making. Mr. Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, leaned into the Silicon Valley stereotype and then some, playing video games while pitching investors and wearing a T-shirt and shorts onstage with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Blue-chip investors fell for his persona, and Mr. Bankman-Fried profited greatly, with his estimated net worth reaching over $26 billion at one point.
That net worth is now close to zero. In last week’s sudden collapse of FTX — which nine months ago was the star of a Larry David Super Bowl ad — billions evaporated as revelations emerged of questionable transfers between FTX and Alameda Research, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s trading company. Law enforcement is now investigating, which could lead to criminal charges.
We’ve seen this movie before: A casually attired whiz kid emerging from seemingly nowhere is proclaimed both savant and savior, and takes the world by storm. Growing concern about Big Tech’s power and intense criticism of onetime wunderkinds like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos set the stage perfectly for a figure like Mr. Bankman-Fried. Amid power-hungry moguls and crypto hustlers, here was a white-knight superhero in the perfect costume, championing philanthropy and pledging to make the world a better place — for real, this time.
But even Mr. Bankman-Fried’s collapse probably won’t kill the whiz kid archetype. This all-American notion has fueled some spectacular meltdowns but also scored big wins. The willingness of U.S. investors and customers to take bets on the young, untested and brainy has delivered world-transforming innovations and companies — a computer on every desk, a smartphone in every hand.

But the whiz kid fixation also reflects a less healthy societal tendency to overstate the importance of individual “genius” and gloss over other things critical to any whiz kid’s success — especially connections, timing and luck. It also devalues experience and maturity. We invest so much in the ideal that it excludes those who don’t fit the part and places too much faith in those who do.

Silicon Valley’s whiz kids owe their mythology to America’s very beginnings. Ben Franklin, who conducted electrical experiments in lightning storms in the 1750s, shocked the bewigged and bejeweled French court in the 1770s by arriving in a homespun coat and frontiersman’s fur cap. Thomas Jefferson, Virginia planter and perpetually tinkering inventor, padded around the White House wearing the early 1800s version of work-from-home sweatpants.
Their get-ups deliberately sent a message to their fellow citizens and to European rulers: Americans were democratic, humble and uninterested in dressing to show off their wealth. They were too busy working and inventing to bother.
The Great Inventor himself, Thomas Edison, holder of over 1,000 patents, cannily cultivated an eccentric-genius reputation. At the peak of his fame in the 1870s and 1880s, Edison wore rumpled suits and played pranks using dangerous chemicals on co-workers. Admirers pointed to these quirks as further signs of his brilliance.
And while Edison had detractors, he was never as controversial as the railroad barons, steel kings and financiers whose sharp-elbowed and sometimes fraudulent dealings drove the boom-and-bust Gilded Age economy.

The whiz kid myth lay largely dormant until the 1970s, when the buttoned-up business type was under siege and once unassailable American brands were being battered by oil shocks, stagflation and foreign competition. Enter Steve Jobs of Apple and Bill Gates of Microsoft: impossibly young, tousle-haired, looking nothing like typical business executives. A venture capitalist who visited Apple’s first headquarters — in Mr. Jobs’s parents’ suburban garage — quipped that the wispy-bearded entrepreneur and his business partner, Steve Wozniak, looked like “renegades from the human race.”
Freckled and slight, Mr. Gates looked more like a teenager and could behave that way as well. “At times during an interview he slumped so far in his chair as to be almost prone,” a Seattle Times reporter wrote in 1982. Microsoft’s other co-founder, Paul Allen, was “a large, heavily bearded, mild-mannered man who wore a rumpled corduroy sports jacket.” To become a tech millionaire, it seems, you need to avoid using an iron.
Then the dot-com boom took the stereotype into hyperdrive, largely because being a tech whiz kid now meant becoming really, really rich. “The Golden Geeks,” exclaimed a headline on the cover of Time magazine in early 1996 featuring Marc Andreessen, the 24-year-old co-founder of Netscape, sitting (barefoot, of course) on a gilded throne.
The dot-com bust tanked companies and investment portfolios. Instead of dispensing with the whiz kid model, however, Silicon Valley doubled down. Venture capitalists lost money when the bubble burst, but they were still far wealthier than before the boom, and they knew that the internet age was only getting started.
Out of another garage came Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, who took that brand of iconoclasm and scaled it up to an entire enterprise. Six years later, in 2004, out of a Harvard dorm room, came Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook — similarly single-minded and geeky, readily posing barefoot, making the hoodie into a shorthand signal for business genius.

As the tech world and its group of golden geeks got larger, wealthier and ever more dominant, one thing stayed the same. The whiz kids were, almost exclusively, male, white and young. Women could never get away with being such slobs.
They could, however, dress the part in other ways. Less than a decade ago, the Theranos C.E.O., Elizabeth Holmes, seized the public’s imagination by wearing Steve Jobs-style black turtlenecks and professing a single-minded devotion to changing the world. She had a seemingly monastic routine, an awkward affect and an unvarying wardrobe — like Mr. Zuckerberg, she explained that she wore the same thing every day to avoid having to make one more decision. All these things had become so strongly associated with successful tech founders that they served as proxies for her credibility.
Revelations that Theranos’s vaunted blood-testing technology didn’t work led to Ms. Holmes being tried and convicted of criminal fraud. Last week, she was denied a retrial and will soon be sentenced. The downfall of “the female Steve Jobs” may have made it even more difficult for women and other underrepresented entrepreneurs to obtain funding.
We are waiting to learn whether Mr. Bankman-Fried’s actions crossed the line from questionable to fraudulent. But the fact that the rocketing rise and sudden tumble of him and Ms. Holmes — magnetic, charismatic and remarkably good at getting rich people to give them money — occurred so close together should serve as a warning.
It is not surprising that a nation born from the overthrow of hereditary wealth has long celebrated self-made inventors who forge an independent path. But the startling fall of Sam Bankman-Fried is a good moment to reflect on the perils of placing so much money, faith and power in the hands of a few golden geeks.

The word inculcation has appeared in four articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Jan. 7 in the Opinion essay “How to Go From Homelessness to Venture Capital” by Peter Coy:
… Year Up costs a lot because it aims high. It takes young men and women who are at risk of being stuck at the bottom and puts them on a path to the middle class. Cutting back too much on the coaching and mentoring that students get could render it ineffective. “We’re putting a huge amount of time and effort into holding what we know works, the special sauce, but innovating new models that are faster, that require less philanthropy per student,” Chertavian said.
One solution that Year Up is experimenting with is to outsource the teaching of hard skills — such as proficiency in Microsoft Office — and focus on the “special sauce,” which is Year Up’s inculcation of soft skills such as showing up on time, meeting deadlines and working in teams. The sorts of things students learn, Chertavian said, are: “How do you make small talk when you’re in the elevator with someone? What does proactivity look like? What does it mean to take initiative?”

2022-11-19,"This editorial is the third in a series, “The Danger Within,” urging readers to understand the danger of extremist violence and possible solutions. Read more about the series in a note from Kathleen Kingsbury, the Times Opinion editor.
Sometime in May 2020, Payton Gendron, a 16-year-old in upstate New York, was browsing the website 4chan when he came across a GIF.
It was taken from a livestream recording made the previous year by a gunman as he killed 51 people and wounded more than 40 others at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The killer had written a manifesto explaining that he was motivated by the fear of great replacement theory, the racist belief that secretive forces are importing nonwhite people to dilute countries’ white majorities.
Seeing the video and the manifesto “started my real research into the problems with immigration and foreigners in our white lands — without his livestream I would likely have no idea about the real problems the West is facing,” Mr. Gendron wrote in his own manifesto, posted on the internet shortly before, officials say, he drove to a Tops grocery store in Buffalo and carried out a massacre of his own that left 10 Black people dead.
The authorities say Mr. Gendron’s attack in May mimicked the massacre in Christchurch not just in its motivation but also in tactics. He reduced his caloric intake and cataloged his diet to prepare physically, as the Christchurch killer did. He practiced shooting. He wrote slogans on his rifle, as the Christchurch gunman did. He livestreamed his attack with a GoPro camera attached to his helmet, with the idea of inspiring other attacks by fellow extremists. Mr. Gendron’s screed ran to 180 pages, with 23 percent of those pages copied word-for-word from the Christchurch killer’s manifesto, according to an investigative report on the attacks released last month by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James.
On the day of the shooting, State Senator James Sanders echoed the horrified response of many: “Although this is probably a lone-wolf incident, this is not the first mass shooting we have seen, and sadly it will not be the last,” he said.
It’s unfortunate that the term “lone wolf” has come into such casual use in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks. It aims to describe a person — nearly always a man — who is radicalized to violence but unconnected to an organized terrorist group like Al Qaeda. But it is wrong to think about violent white supremacists as isolated actors.

2022-11-21,"In recent weeks, Microsoft has accused Sony, its chief video game rival, of misleading regulators. Its lawyers have showed off game consoles, including an Xbox, to British officials. And the president of a major union that Microsoft wooed has spoken up on the company’s behalf to the Federal Trade Commission.
The actions are part of a campaign by Microsoft to counter intensifying scrutiny of its $69 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, the largest consumer technology deal since AOL bought Time Warner two decades ago, and far bigger than Elon Musk’s recent $44 billion buyout of Twitter.
Microsoft’s aim is simple: persuade skeptical governments around the globe to approve the blockbuster takeover. Sixteen governments must bless the purchase, putting Microsoft under the most regulatory pressure it has faced since the antitrust battles of the 1990s. And in three key places — the United States, the European Union and Britain — regulators have begun deep reviews, with the European Commission declaring this month that it was opening an in-depth investigation of the deal.
Whether Microsoft succeeds in gaining regulatory approval to buy Activision, which makes games such as Candy Crush and Call of Duty, will send a message about Big Tech’s ability to expand in the face of mounting fears that industry giants wield too much power. If Microsoft, whose public affairs operation has spent the past decade building the company’s nice-guy reputation, can’t get a megadeal through, can anyone?
“If this deal had happened four years ago, this would hardly be of any interest,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in an interview. “If one cannot do something easy, then we’ll all know you can’t do something hard.”
Google, Meta, Amazon and Apple have all faced increasing accusations that they are monopolies, and regulators have tried to block some of their smaller deals. In July, the F.T.C. sued Meta, Facebook’s parent company, to stop it from buying Within, a virtual reality start-up. Last month, Britain forced Meta to sell Giphy, an image database it bought in 2020 for $315 million.

2022-11-28,"In the weeks since Elon Musk took over Twitter, dozens of people responsible for keeping dangerous or inaccurate material in check on the service have posted on LinkedIn that they resigned or lost their jobs. Their statements have drawn a flood of condolences — and attempts to recruit them.
Overtures arrived from rival tech services, retailers, consulting firms, government contractors and other organizations that want to use the former Twitter employees — and those recently let go by Meta and the payments platform Stripe — to track and combat false and toxic information on the internet.
Ania Smith, the chief executive of TaskRabbit, the Ikea-owned marketplace for gig workers, commented on a former Twitter employee’s post this month that he should consider applying for a product director role, working in part on trust and safety tools.
“The war for talent has really been exceptional in the last 24 months in tech,” Ms. Smith said in an interview. “So when we see layoffs happening, whether it’s at Twitter or Meta or other companies, it’s definitely an opportunity to go after some of the very high-caliber talent we know they hire.”

She added that making users feel safe on the TaskRabbit platform was a key component of her company’s success.
“We can’t really continue growing without investing in a trust and safety team,” she said.
The threats posed by conspiracy theories, misleadingly manipulated media, hate speech, child abuse, fraud and other online harms have been studied for years by academic researchers, think tanks and government analysts. But increasingly, companies in and outside the tech industry see that abuse as a potentially expensive liability, especially as more work is conducted online and regulators and clients push for stronger guardrails.
On LinkedIn, under posts eulogizing Twitter’s work on elections and content moderation, comments promoted openings at TikTok (threat researcher), DoorDash (community policy manager) and Twitch (trust and safety incident manager). Managers at other companies solicited suggestions for names to add to recruiting databases. Google, Reddit, Microsoft, Discord and ActiveFence — a four-year-old company that said last year that it had raised $100 million and that it could scan more than three million sources of malicious chatter in every language — also have job postings.

The trust and safety field barely existed a decade ago, and the talent pool is still small, said Lisa Kaplan, the founder of Alethea, a company that uses early-detection technology to help clients protect against disinformation campaigns. The three-year-old company has 35 employees; Ms. Kaplan said she hoped to add 23 more by mid-2023 and was trying to recruit former Twitter employees.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Disinformation, she said, is like “the new malware” — a “digital reality that is ultimately going to impact every company.” Clients that once employed armed guards to stand outside data rooms, and then built online firewalls to block hackers, are now calling firms like Alethea for backup when, for example, coordinated influence campaigns target public perception of their brand and threaten their stock price, Ms. Kaplan said.
“Anyone can do this — it’s fast, cheap and easy,” she said. “As more actors get into the practice of weaponizing information, either for financial, reputational, political or ideological gain, you’re going to see more targets. This market is emerging because the threat has risen and the consequences have become more real.”
Disinformation became widely recognized as a significant problem in 2016, said John Kelly, who was an academic researcher at Columbia, Harvard and Oxford before founding Graphika, a social media analysis firm, in 2013. The company’s employees are known as “the cartographers of the internet age” for their work building detailed maps of social media for clients such as Pinterest and Meta.
Graphika's focus, initially on mining digital marketing insights, has steadily shifted toward topics such as disinformation campaigns coordinated by foreigners, extremist narratives and climate misinformation. The transition, which began in 2016 with the discovery of Russian influence operations targeting the U.S. presidential election, intensified with the onslaught of Covid-19 conspiracy theories during the pandemic, Mr. Kelly said.

“The problems have spilled out of the political arena and become a Fortune 500 problem,” he said. “The range of online harms has expanded, and the range of people doing the online harm has expanded.”

Efforts to tackle misinformation and disinformation have included research initiatives from top-tier universities and policy institutes, media literacy campaigns and initiatives to repopulate news deserts with local journalism outfits.
Many social media platforms have set up internal teams to address the problem or outsourced content moderation work to large companies such as Accenture, according to a July report from the geopolitical think tank German Marshall Fund. In September, Google completed its $5.4 billion acquisition of Mandiant, an 18-year-old company that tracks online influence activities as well as offering other cybersecurity services.
A growing group of start-ups, many of which rely on artificial intelligence to root out and decode online narratives, conduct similar exercises, often for clients in corporate America.
Alethea wrapped up a $10 million fund-raising round in October. Also last month, Spotify said it bought the five-year-old Irish company Kinzen, citing its grasp on “the complexity of analyzing audio content in hundreds of languages and dialects, and the challenges in effectively evaluating the nuance and intent of that content.” (Months earlier, Spotify found itself trying to quell an uproar over accusations that its star podcast host, Joe Rogan, was spreading vaccine misinformation.) Amazon’s Alexa Fund participated in a $24 million funding round last winter for five-year-old Logically, which uses artificial intelligence to identify misinformation and disinformation on topics such as climate change and Covid-19.

“Along with all the fantastic aspects of the web come new problems like bias, misinformation and offensive content to name a few,” Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, wrote on a crowdfunding page last year for Factmata, another A.I.-fueled disinformation defense operation. “It can be confusing and difficult to cut through to the trusted, truthful information.”

The businesses are hiring across a broad spectrum of trust and safety roles despite a host of recent layoff announcements.
Companies have courted people expert at recognizing content posted by child abusers or human traffickers, as well as former military counterterrorism agents with advanced degrees in law, political science and engineering. Moderators, many of whom work as contractors, are also in demand.
Mounir Ibrahim, the vice president of public affairs and impact for Truepic, a tech company specializing in image and digital content authenticity, said many early clients were banks and insurance companies that relied more and more on digital transactions.

“We are at an inflection point of the modern internet right now,” he said. “We are facing a tsunami of generative and synthetic material that is going to hit our computer screens very, very soon — not just images and videos, but text, code, audio, everything under the sun. And this is going to have tremendous effects on not just disinformation but brand integrity, the financial tech world, on the insurance world and across nearly every vertical that is now digitally transforming on the heels of Covid.”
Truepic was featured with companies such as Zignal Labs and Memetica in the German Marshall Fund report about disinformation-defense start-ups. Anya Schiffrin, the lead author and a senior lecturer at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, said future regulation of disinformation and other malicious content could lead to more jobs in the trust and safety space.
She said regulators around the European Union were already hiring people to help carry out the new Digital Services Act, which requires internet platforms to combat misinformation and restrict certain online ads.
“I’m really tired of these really rich companies saying that it’s too expensive — it’s a cost of doing business, not an extra, add-on luxury,” Ms. Schiffrin said. “If you can’t provide accurate, quality information to your customers, then you’re not a going concern.”"

Elon Musk wages war on Apple
Elon Musk has been unafraid of picking fights, whether with prominent politicians, political whistle-blowers or his own employees. But in taking on Apple on Monday, the Twitter owner was trying to start a brawl that could have ramifications stretching from Silicon Valley to Washington.
Mr. Musk complained that Apple had paused most of its advertising on Twitter, continuing his berating of companies that have done so. But it’s his allegation that Apple “threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store but won’t tell us why” that could prove more important.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Apple is a major source of ad dollars for Twitter. It was the biggest advertiser on the platform in the year’s first quarter, spending $48 million, according to The Washington Post.
Mr. Musk’s App Store allegation resurrects a potent charge against Apple: that it has used access to millions of iPhone and iPad devices as a cudgel to extract more money from app makers. A key part of Mr. Musk’s plans for Twitter is collecting more revenue from subscriptions — but under Apple’s policies, up to 30 percent of those sales from iPhone users would go to Apple itself. (“Did you know Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?” Mr. Musk tweeted.)
But Mr. Musk has also pitched his complaint in bombastically broader terms, calling it “a battle for the future of civilization.” (Twitter’s former head of public safety, Yoel Roth, wrote in a recent Times guest essay that Apple’s and Google’s app stores do prohibit certain kinds of content, and that failure to adhere to those rules — including by allowing certain kinds of material on the Twitter app — “would be catastrophic” to Twitter’s business.)
So far, Apple hasn’t commented on Musk’s allegations.
Apple is already being investigated for its App Store policies, including by the Justice Department. Meanwhile, Spotify sued Apple for rejecting its audiobooks app three times, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior. And Epic Games is still locked in a legal fight with Apple over forced use of the company’s in-app payment system. (Epic’s C.E.O., Tim Sweeney, backed Musk’s fight on Tuesday, tweeting, “Apple is a menace to freedom worldwide.”)
More on China
Driverless Cars: Across China, more assisted driving systems and robot taxis are being tested than in any other country, with censors limiting discussions about safety.
A Disappearing Internet: The number of Chinese websites is shrinking and posts are being removed and censored, stoking fears about what happens when history is erased.
A Landmark Political Trial: As part of China’s crackdown on dissent, 14 democracy activists in Hong Kong were convicted on national security charges. They now face prison time along with dozens of others.
A Recipe for Total Control: Reviving a Mao-era surveillance campaign, Chinese authorities are tracking residents, schoolchildren and businesses to forestall any potential unrest.
Republicans — including Representative Ken Buck of Colorado and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, the ranking members of the House and Senate antitrust subcommittees — also seized upon Musk’s comments as proof that Apple and Google should open up their app stores.

Inside the last days of FTX
The fallout from FTX’s collapse is still being felt. On Monday, BlockFi, a crypto lender that targeted individual investors, offering them loans and high-interest savings accounts backed by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, filed for bankruptcy. In June, FTX extended a $400 million lifeline to BlockFi, which had been struggling for months. At the time, BlockFi had other bidders offering to help. But in the wake of FTX’s demise, few are willing or able to offer a rescue to failing crypto firms.

FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, appears to have thought that a savior, or solution, would emerge as his own firm flailed. That was the case even in the exchange’s final hours. The result was a chaotic last few days for FTX, which pitted S.B.F., as he’s known, against his former top aides for control of the firm, according to new documents detailed in a report this morning by The Times’s David Yaffe-Bellany. Documents, internal texts and emails sent in the days before FTX’s Nov. 11 bankruptcy filing show S.B.F. as increasingly deluded and desperate; top lawyers and staffs at the firm struggled to convince S.B.F. that bankruptcy was the only option.
In a Nov. 10 email to staff, S.B.F. said he was close to securing new financing from the crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun. It never materialized.
Senior FTX employees reached out to S.B.F.’s father, the Stanford Law School professor Joe Bankman, in an effort to get his son to give up control of the company.
S.B.F. delayed the hiring of John Jay Ray III, the restructuring expert who has since taken over the company, thinking he still had time to raise new funds.
Early on Nov. 11, S.B.F. refused to sign off on FTX’s bankruptcy filing.
“The founding team is not in a cooperative posture,” Ryne Miller, a top FTX lawyer based in the U.S., wrote in an email to S.B.F. and other staffers. “Please can you sign the document,” Miller wrote S.B.F. at 2:29 a.m. on Nov. 11.
S.B.F. continues to believe he could have saved the firm. Even after FTX filed for bankruptcy, and having resigned as C.E.O., he continued contacting potential investors about providing new funding. In a brief interview this weekend, S.B.F. told The Times that he had lined up “numerous parties” willing to invest in FTX, even after its collapse, though he declined to name them.
Here’s what else is happening in crypto this morning.
Digital asset prices are bouncing back, with Bitcoin up 1.7 percent to trade near $16,500.
A venture firm tied to Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire and a major Bitcoin booster, held a 19 percent stake in the now-bankrupt BlockFi.
BlockFi is suing S.B.F.’s investment vehicle to seize the shares it owns in Robinhood, the trading app operator. According to BlockFi, the FTX founder had pledged the stock as collateral, but never paid up.
The crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay $360,000 to settle a dispute with the Treasury Department over whether it violated sanctions policy by allowing users in Iran to trade crypto.

Why China’s zero-Covid policy matters to the world
China is once again moving global markets on Tuesday — this time, higher.
Investors appear to be betting Beijing will ease its zero-Covid policy, even as authorities reasserted their commitment to the approach. Rare public protests against President Xi Jinping’s highly restrictive policy have been largely quashed, but the damage to the economy is putting pressure on the government to reopen parts of the country that are under full or partial lockdown.
The evidence of any easing is thin. China announced it would renew its vaccination push for older people, but otherwise has only slightly tweaked its anti-Covid policy. In Shanghai, the country’s financial center, authorities closed some businesses and reintroduced quarantine for close contacts. Nevertheless, stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rebounded sharply on Tuesday, and that risk-friendly mood has swept into Europe and U.S. stock futures. Here’s how China’s approach to the virus almost three years after the start of the pandemic is still preoccupying global investors:
China’s growth is slowing. Nomura last week cut its China G.D.P. forecast for this year (+2.8 percent) and next (+4 percent), predicting a rocky road ahead. “Markets might be tumultuous this week. Reopening will be slow, painful and bumpy,” Ting Lu, the bank’s chief China economist, warned investors on Monday. If that slowdown further hits China’s massive manufacturing sector, there would be consequences for the global supply chain — Apple already expects a production shortfall of 6 million iPhones because of disruptions at a Zhengzhou factory — and stocks. Apple fell 2.6 percent on Monday, underperforming the S&P 500.
Commodity prices are highly dependent on China. The country “consumes 40 to 70 percent of global commodity supply,” Tom Price, head of commodities strategy at Liberum, an investment bank, told DealBook. Uncertainty over whether Chinese factories and industrial plants would be shut because of infection has added volatility to the pricing of everything from crude oil to iron and gold in recent weeks, Price noted.
A possible silver lining: the impact on emissions. China is the world’s biggest greenhouse-gas emitter. One effect of zero-Covid crackdowns in cities across the country: the Chinese have been driving less frequently. According to Rystad Energy, “Chinese road traffic remains well below comparable 2020 and 2021 levels as persistent lockdowns and China’s growth slowdown weigh on road traffic.” If that were to persist, it could limit oil prices in the short term — something to watch as OPEC+ nations meet next week to determine production policy.

2022-12-02,"For the past five months Paul Rizzo, 38, has been delivering food and groceries through the DoorDash app. But he spent the first half of 2022 earning no paycheck at all — reflecting a surprising trend among middle-aged men.
After learning last Christmas that his job as an analyst at a hospital company was being automated, Mr. Rizzo chose to stay at home to care for his two young sons. His wife wanted to go back to work, and he was discouraged in his own career after more than a decade of corporate tumult and repeated disappointment. He thought he might be able to earn enough income on his investments to pull it off financially.
Mr. Rizzo’s decision to step away from employment during his prime working years hints at one of the biggest surprises in today’s job market: Hundreds of thousands of men in their late 30s and early 40s stopped working during the pandemic and have lingered on the labor market’s sidelines since. While Mr. Rizzo has recently returned to earning money, many men his age seem to be staying out of the work force altogether. They are an anomaly, as employment rates have rebounded more fully for women of the same age and for both younger and older men.
About 89.7 percent of men ages 35 to 44 were working or looking for work as of November, down from 90.9 percent before the pandemic. The group’s employment rate showed signs of rebounding last month, but has been unusually depressed on average over the past year.

The decline in labor force participation among middle-aged men has spanned racial groups, but it has been most heavily concentrated among men who — like Mr. Rizzo — do not have a four-year college degree. The pullback comes despite the fact that wages are rising and job openings are plentiful, including in fields like truck driving and construction, where college degrees are not required and men tend to dominate.
Economists have not determined any single factor that is keeping men from returning to work. Instead, they attribute the trend to a cocktail of changing social norms around parenthood and marriage, shifting opportunities, and lingering scars of the 2008 to 2009 downturn — which cost many people in that age group jobs just as they were starting their careers.
“Now, all of a sudden, you’re kind of getting your life together, and if you’re in the wrong industry …” Mr. Rizzo said, trailing off as he discussed his recent labor market experience. “I wasn’t the only one who dropped out. I can tell you that.”

Men have been withdrawing from the labor force for decades. In the years following World War II, more than 97 percent of men in their prime working years — defined by economists as ages 25 to 54 — were working or actively looking for work, according to federal data. But starting in the 1960s, that share began to fall, mirroring the decline in domestic manufacturing jobs.

What is new is that a small demographic slice — men who were early in their careers during the 2008 recession — seems to be most heavily affected.
“I think there’s a lot of very discouraged people out there,” said Jane Oates, a former Labor Department official who now heads WorkingNation, a nonprofit focused on work force development.
Men lost jobs in astonishing numbers during the 2008 financial crisis as the construction and home-building industries contracted. It took years to regain that ground — for men who were then in their 20s and early 30s and just getting started in their careers, employment rates never fully recovered.
Economists came up with a range of explanations for the men’s slow return to the labor force. After the war on crime of the 1980s and 1990s, more men had criminal records that made it difficult to land jobs. The rise of opioid addiction had sidelined others. Video games had improved in quality, so staying home might have become more attractive. And the decline of nuclear family units may have diminished the traditional male role as economic provider.

Now, recent history appears to be repeating itself — but for one specific age group. The question is why 35- to 44-year-old men seem to be staying out of work and job searches more than other demographics.
Patricia Blumenauer, vice president of data and operations at Philadelphia Works, a work force development agency, said she had observed a dip in the number of men in that age range coming in for services. A disproportionately high share of those who do come in leave without taking a job.
Ms. Blumenauer said that age range is a group “that we’re not seeing show up.” She thinks some men who lost their blue-collar jobs early in the pandemic may be looking for something with flexibility and higher pay. “The ability to work from home three days a week, or have a four-day weekend — things that other jobs have figured out — aren’t possible for those types of occupations.”
When men don’t find those flexible jobs or can’t compete for them, they might choose to make ends meet by staying with relatives or doing under-the-table work, Ms. Blumenauer said.
The pandemic has probably also slowed America’s already-weak family formation, giving single or childless men less of an incentive to settle into steady jobs, said the economist Ariel Binder. On the flip side, disruptions to schooling and child care meant that some men who already had families may have stopped doing paid work to take on more household tasks.

“So on the one hand you get these men who are just not expecting to have a stable romantic relationship for most of their lives and are setting their time use accordingly,” Dr. Binder said. “Then there are men who are participating in these family structures, but doing so in nontraditional ways.”
Like labor force experts, government data suggest that a combination of forces are at play.
A growing number of men do seem to be taking on more child care duties, time use and other survey data suggests. But a shift toward being stay-at-home dads is unlikely to be the full story: Employment trends look the same for men in the age group who report having young kids living with them and those who don’t.
What clearly does matter is education. The participation decline is more heavily concentrated among people who have not graduated from college, based on detailed government survey data.

Some economists speculate that the disproportionate decline could be because the age group has been buffeted by repeated crises, making their labor market footing fragile. They lost work early in their careers in 2008, faced a slow recovery after and found their jobs at risk again amid 2020 layoffs and an ongoing shift toward automation.

“This group has been hit by automation, by globalization,” said David Dorn, a Swiss economist who studies labor markets.
That fragility theory makes sense to Mr. Rizzo.
He had seen the Navy as his ticket out of poverty in Louisiana and had expected to have a career in the service until he broke his back during basic training. He retired from the military after a few years. Then he pivoted, earning a two-year degree in Georgia and beginning a bachelor’s degree at Arizona State University — with dreams of one day working to cure cancer.
Then the Great Recession hit. Mr. Rizzo had been working nights in a laboratory to afford rent and tuition, but the job ended abruptly in 2009. Phoenix was ground zero for the financial implosion’s fallout.
Frantic job applications yielded nothing, and Mr. Rizzo had to drop out of school. Worse, he found himself staring down imminent homelessness. His tax refund saved him by allowing him and his wife to move back to Louisiana, where jobs were more plentiful. But after they divorced, he hit a low point.
“I had nothing to show for my life after my 20s,” he explained.
Mr. Rizzo spent the next decade rebuilding. He worked his way through various corporate positions where he taught himself skills in Excel and Microsoft SharePoint, married again, had two sons and bought a house.

Yet he was regularly at risk of losing work to downsizing or technology — including late last year. The company he worked for wanted him to move into a new role, perhaps as a traveling salesperson, when his desk job disappeared. But his sons have special needs and that was not an option.
He quit in January. He watched the kids, posted on his investment-related YouTube channel and watched Netflix. He thought he might be able to live on military payments and dividend income, becoming part of the “Financial Independence, Retire Early,” or FIRE, trend. But then the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and markets gyrated.
“I got FIRE, all right,” he said. “My whole portfolio got set on fire.”

Mr. Rizzo turned to DoorDash, earning his first paycheck on July 4. While he is technically back in the labor market, gig work like his isn’t well measured in jobs data. If many men are taking a similar path but do not work every week, they might be overlooked in surveys, which ask if someone worked for pay in the previous week to determine whether they were employed.
Mr. Rizzo is waiting to see what happens to his DoorDash income in an economic pullback before he rules out corporate work forever. Already, other dashers are complaining that business is slowing as people have spent down pandemic savings.

2022-12-05,"A few months after Microsoft announced plans to acquire the video game maker Activision Blizzard, the tech giant said it would remain neutral if Activision workers sought to unionize once the deal went through. Now, a major union is testing Microsoft’s appetite for organizing at a company it already owns.
A group of more than 300 employees at ZeniMax Media, a Maryland-based video game maker owned by Microsoft, has begun voting on whether to form the company’s only union in the United States.
The vote, among quality assurance employees at ZeniMax, which includes prominent studios like Bethesda Game Studios, is taking place under an informal agreement in which Microsoft is staying neutral. Workers can sign a union authorization card, as some began doing last month, or weigh in anonymously for or against unionization on an electronic platform that opened on Friday.
The process will conclude at the end of the month and is more efficient than a typical union election, which is overseen by the National Labor Relations Board and can involve legal wrangling over the terms of the election.

The same day that voting began at Microsoft, a group of workers in quality assurance, or Q.A., at an Activision-owned studio near Albany, N.Y., won a union vote, 14 to 0. That result followed a successful union vote in May by about two dozen Q.A. workers at an Activision studio in Wisconsin, a first for a major North American video game maker. Activision’s planned acquisition by Microsoft, for about $70 billion, is facing antitrust review by regulators.
The organizing campaigns at both companies have been under the auspices of the Communications Workers of America, which also represents employees at telecom companies like Verizon and media companies like The New York Times.
Together, the developments appear to add momentum to a wave of union organizing over the past year at previously nonunion companies like Amazon, Starbucks and Apple. The recent campaigns also suggest that video game workers, who for years have complained of long hours, low pay, and sexual harassment and discrimination, may be increasingly receptive to unionization.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
A 300-worker union would be “quite groundbreaking” and could propel Q.A. workers, and even other game workers like developers, to unionize at other large studios, said Johanna Weststar, an associate professor at Western University in Ontario who studies labor in the industry.
A Microsoft spokeswoman said that the organizing campaign was “an example of our labor principles in action” and that the company remained “committed to providing employees with an opportunity to freely and fairly make choices about their workplace representation.”

The union campaign at Microsoft would affect Q.A. workers at several gaming studios that are a part of ZeniMax Media, including Bethesda, which makes hit franchises like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout.
Microsoft, which makes the Xbox series of consoles, acquired ZeniMax for $7.5 billion, a splashy pandemic purchase that helped it compete against rival Sony and its PlayStation consoles, as well as broaden the appeal of Xbox Game Pass, its video game subscription service. The deal closed last year.
The first new major, exclusive-to-Xbox game stemming from that purchase, Starfield, is expected to be released next year by Bethesda. Some of the workers who test it may do so as union members.
Three ZeniMax employees said that while helping to make video games was a job they had once dreamed of, their Q.A. roles had taken a toll.

Victoria Banos, who has worked at one of the company’s studios in Maryland for over four years, said many of her co-workers endured a ritual known as “crunch” a few times each year. It involves working shifts longer than 10 hours during the week and several hours on Saturday, sometimes for weeks in a row, to ensure that a game works properly before the company releases it.

“You’re expected to drop whatever you have going on in your life and work whenever they need you to,” said Ms. Banos, who works on The Elder Scrolls Online. She added that ZeniMax had recently made these overtime hours voluntary, but that many employees still felt pressure to work them.
She estimated that her hourly wage of $25.50 left her tens of thousands of dollars below what she would earn annually if she performed a similar job at a different kind of software company — like one that makes financial or security software.
Other gaming industry Q.A. testers have echoed these points, citing crunch as a continuing problem and arguing that the industry gets away with paying them less because of the allure of its products and the idea that they should be happy to earn an income playing games. Workers say the mind-numbing process of repeatedly testing specific actions for glitches is far different from playing a game for fun.
Some ZeniMax workers also said they preferred more liberal policies on working from home, and they complained that the company’s method of allocating training opportunities, additional responsibility and promotions was often arbitrary or opaque. They said they hoped a union would help create more transparent policies.
Andrés Vázquez, who has been based at a ZeniMax studio in the Dallas area for more than seven years, said he had yet to be promoted to the next job level, senior Q.A. tester, even though some co-workers who joined the company around the same time had been promoted beyond that level. Whenever he has raised the issue with managers or human resources officials, he said, “I get corporate lip service.”

The Microsoft spokeswoman said the company was talking to employees to ensure that they were not taking on too much work, but she did not comment on the other concerns.
Still, the workers praised Microsoft for following through on its promise of neutrality. Unlike workers at Starbucks and Amazon, they say, they have not been summoned to meetings in which supervisors seek to dissuade them from unionizing, and they do not feel that the company has retaliated against them for trying to form a union. (Starbucks and Amazon have denied accusations of retaliation.)
“It’s been an incredible weight lifted off our shoulders,” said Autumn Mitchell, another Q.A. employee based in Maryland, who has worked on Starfield, the forthcoming game.
Workers at the studio near Albany also cited concerns over pay and hours in their decision to unionize, as well as accusations of harassment and discrimination at the company.
Amanda Laven, a Q.A. employee involved in the union campaign at the studio, said workers were frustrated that the company had tried to stop their union election on the grounds that it involved only Q.A. workers rather than the whole studio. The National Labor Relations Board had rejected Activision’s attempts to stop the union election at its Wisconsin studio on similar grounds, but the company appealed to the labor board in this case as well.

“It’s just a stall tactic,” Ms. Laven said in an interview before the vote count.
An Activision spokesman said that the company’s operations in New York and Wisconsin were “very different” in their setup and that it believed the entire Albany studio should be eligible to vote. The spokesman said the company was “considering various legal options,” including seeking to overturn the election.
Activision workers seeking to unionize could find the company more receptive in the future.
In June, Microsoft announced an agreement with the Communications Workers of America in which it pledged to stay neutral if any of Activision’s U.S. employees sought to unionize after it completed its acquisition. Activision has about 7,000 employees in the country, most of whom are eligible to unionize.
Microsoft had a motive for seeking the neutrality agreement: The politically powerful communications workers union had raised questions about the acquisition, which regulators were vetting. The union said its concerns about the acquisition had been resolved after it reached the neutrality agreement.
The company hinted at the time that it would extend the neutrality agreement to current Microsoft employees, saying it was prepared to “build on” the deal. The union essentially tested that proposition when it sought to organize Q.A. workers at ZeniMax, and Microsoft followed through.
Microsoft may have had an additional reason to take a neutral stance. Showing that it has a healthy relationship with organized labor could help the company navigate the acquisition under the union-friendly Biden administration as scrutiny of the deal intensifies.

2022-12-06,"In a last-minute attempt to placate antitrust regulators, Microsoft said on Tuesday night that it would bring the blockbuster video game franchise Call of Duty to Nintendo devices if its $69 billion acquisition of the game’s maker, Activision Blizzard, was completed.
Microsoft’s deal to buy Activision — the largest consumer technology deal since AOL bought Time Warner two decades ago — faces reviews by antitrust regulators around the globe.
Many in the video game industry expect the Federal Trade Commission to discuss the acquisition in a closed-door session scheduled for Thursday. The commission could vote on whether to file a lawsuit in an effort to block the deal.
Regulators are primarily focused on concerns that consumers would be harmed if Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, withheld Activision’s games from competitors or unfairly leveraged Activision’s popular titles as more video games were streamed online.

The 10-year deal to bring future releases of Call of Duty to Switch video game devices made by Nintendo, one of Microsoft’s rivals, is part of Microsoft’s efforts to signal that it wouldn’t block the popular game from devices made by other companies.
Microsoft also announced that it would continue its commitment to release Call of Duty with Valve, the maker of the Steam distribution platform, which is popular with gamers who play on personal computers rather than game consoles. Call of Duty’s latest release is already available on Steam.
“There’s been some question about whether what we’re saying is actually how we’re acting, and I think having two major industry partners kind of show that our intent is real and that we can reach agreements is an important thing in this time,” Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft’s gaming business, said in an interview.
Call of Duty is also a key video game for Sony’s PlayStation console, and Microsoft has offered to maintain that relationship for at least another 10 years if the Activision deal goes through. Sony declined to comment on Microsoft’s offer after it was made. Sony has objected to Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, arguing that it would reduce choices for gamers.
“We’re happy that Microsoft wants to continue using Steam to reach customers with Call of Duty when their Activision acquisition closes,” Gabe Newell, the president of Valve, said in a statement. “Microsoft has been on Steam for a long time and we take it as a signal that they are happy with gamers’ reception to that and the work we are doing.”

Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A long-running franchise in which players fight in historical, present-day and futuristic battles, Call of Duty is a crown jewel in Activision’s portfolio. It has earned more than $30 billion in revenue. The latest version, Modern Warfare II, made more than $1 billion in just 10 days.
For Nintendo, adding a violent first-person shooter game like Call of Duty to the host of titles available to play on the Switch would be an uncommon departure. The company has long been protective of the playful, family-friendly branding it has developed over decades through iconic franchises like Mario, Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda, though it does offer some more mature games and other Nintendo devices have hosted Call of Duty.
Sony and Microsoft have sparred often over a similar segment of so-called hard-core gamers, who might be more drawn to dark, story-driven games or challenging and violent combat games.
But Nintendo has built an empire marketing lovable, candy-colored characters, like the squishy pink Kirby and the smiling dinosaur Yoshi. At the beginning of the pandemic, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a tranquil game in which players build virtual islands, became a smash hit.
Nintendo’s newest console, the Switch is significantly cheaper than Sony’s PlayStation 5 or Microsoft’s Xbox Series X, and differs from the more expensive, boxier consoles by being small and portable, so players can game on the go.

The Switch has been a huge success, selling 114 million units as of the end of September. But it has less processing power than the newest Microsoft and Sony consoles, raising questions about what kind of an experience playing Call of Duty would be on a Nintendo device.
“Nintendo has done a great job of creating a family-friendly platform that can be successful for all kinds of creators,” Mr. Spencer said, adding that there was “definitely work” to be done to make Call of Duty run well on the Switch.
Still, Nintendo does already offer some shooter games on the Switch, like Fortnite, and Call of Duty could appeal to Nintendo users who want a “flexible style of gameplay,” said David Gibson, a senior analyst for the Australian-based financial services company MST Financial. The move, he said, would be “good for Nintendo’s platform for sure.”
Gaming has become Microsoft’s most important consumer business, and when it announced the Activision acquisition in January it signaled that getting approval from antitrust regulators could be cumbersome. Microsoft said closing the deal could take a year and a half, and agreed to pay Activision as much as $3 billion if the tie-up falls apart.
In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, wrote about the 10-year offer to Sony and said the company was “open to providing the same commitment to other platforms and making it legally enforceable by regulators in the U.S., U.K. and European Union.”"
2022-12-07,"LOS ANGELES — Steve Ballmer, the owner of the N.B.A.’s Clippers, is known for being a wacky guy. He sits courtside at home games and punches at the air wildly, leaping from his seat, dancing and shouting.
He is intense.
He once said he wanted to put spikes in the seats at the Clippers’ next arena to keep fans up and cheering. But he swears it was just a joke.
What he really wants, and won’t get, is for the seats to vibrate.
“Haptic feedback,” he said. “You know, BRRR.”
If Ballmer had it his way, the whole city would buzz with excitement about the Clippers, the perennially unloved and underachieving little brother to the Lakers. He is spending his considerable energy, and billions of his fortune, to carve out real space for the Clippers in a crowded Los Angeles sports market.

“What does it take to succeed when you’re behind?” Ballmer, 66, said. “Well, it takes a while. You have to be patient. It takes a while to capture people’s loyalties. You have to be successful. You got to build a good product, which means we have to have good teams out there year in and year out. Got to win championships.”
He added: “I have to live a long and full life so we can get there.”
The Lakers have spent decades establishing their identity as one of the N.B.A.’s glamour franchises. They are the team of Showtime, of championships, of the league’s biggest stars, like Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. Hollywood’s elite come to their games to see the show and to be seen.
The Clippers have struggled to define themselves, but since Ballmer bought the team in 2014 its reputation has started to change.
Stars like Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have chosen to join the Clippers. The team is preparing to leave Crypto.com Arena, which it shares with the Lakers and other teams in downtown Los Angeles, for a glittering new arena 11 miles away in Inglewood in 2024. The once-dominant Lakers have made the playoffs just twice since Ballmer bought the Clippers, creating an opportunity for the Clippers to gain ground among local men’s basketball fans.

The Clippers made only four playoff appearances between 1984-85, when they moved to Los Angeles from San Diego, and 2010-11, the season before they traded for the All-Star point guard Chris Paul. The Lakers won eight championships during that period.
“The Clippers always been looked at as the other team,” said Paul Pierce, the Hall of Fame player who grew up in Inglewood and spent the final two years of his 19-year N.B.A. career with the Clippers.
There were moments when the Clippers flashed into the imagination of the basketball world. In the early 2000s, a group of young players — Darius Miles, Lamar Odom and Quentin Richardson among them — earned fans’ adoration with their fun personalities and the playing style of an ultra-talented pickup team. But the Clippers made the playoffs only once in the first decade of the century.
“The Clippers never really had a place, you know what I mean?” said Baron Davis, 43, a retired two-time All-Star guard who grew up in Los Angeles and played for U.C.L.A. “And I knew when I signed with the Clippers, my goals in three years, four years, we wanted to make it another destination in L.A.”
They did not become serious contenders until they traded with New Orleans for Paul in December 2011 and ushered in the so-called Lob City era, named for the way Paul would connect with the high-flying forward Blake Griffin for thrilling dunks to punctuate fast breaks.

That period coincided with a downturn for the Lakers, opening the door for some fans, particularly younger ones, to choose the Clippers.
“The Lakers sucked when I first started watching basketball,” Charlie Muir, a high school senior, said at a recent Clippers game. He added: “I saw the Clippers. They had, like, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin. It was Lob City era so it was really exciting to watch.”
The teams that included Paul and Griffin had their best shot at winning a championship in 2014, but fell short and had to deal with a scandal. During the playoffs that season, TMZ published audio of the team owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks about Black people.

Ballmer, a basketball fanatic who is a former chief executive of Microsoft, lived in Seattle and had grown up in Detroit, so he wasn’t familiar with the dynamics of having two major teams from the same league in the same city.
“The notion that, like, somebody you run into on the street might be against your team, to me, that was like, whoa, zany,” Ballmer said.
For years, Loyola Marymount University published the results of an annual survey that asked Los Angeles County residents which sports team with Los Angeles in its name was their favorite. In 2014, when there were eight such teams, 6.7 percent of respondents chose the Clippers, significantly less than the Lakers (42.9 percent) and Major League Baseball’s Dodgers (33.8 percent) but still more than the five other teams.
By 2021, the Lakers and Clippers had become less favored and the N.F.L.’s Rams, which re-entered the market in 2016 after two decades away, had picked up 6 percent of the vote. There are nine professional men’s teams that have Los Angeles in their name, a W.N.B.A. team, a National Women’s Soccer League team and two colleges with major sports programs — U.C.L.A. and Southern California — that all compete for attention.

The Clippers, Lakers and Kings have shared an arena since 1999, when Staples Center — which was renamed Crypto.com Arena last year — opened in downtown Los Angeles. The W.N.B.A.’s Sparks joined them in 2001. The Clippers have third priority, so they have to build their schedule around the Lakers and Kings. They cover the Lakers’ championship banners with their own signage during home games. There are 10 statues in the plaza in front of the arena: six honoring Laker greats, three featuring Kings and one of the boxer Oscar De La Hoya. Los Angeles is the only city in the United States where multiple pairs of teams in the same sports share buildings.
“I think anyone, to some degree, that is not the Lakers or Dodgers, there’s a challenger status that is a little bit unique,” said Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ chief operating officer.
After 21 seasons in St. Louis, the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016. They won the Super Bowl in the 2021 season, in Inglewood at SoFi Stadium, which they share with the Chargers.
“Winning is the cover charge to getting people to appreciate you, especially if you’re in that challenger status,” Demoff said. But he added: “This is not a city where one championship can change your fortunes for a long time. That is just what’s expected.”
Except for the Clippers, Chargers and the N.W.S.L. team Angel City F.C., which played its first season this year, all of the major professional sports teams in the Los Angeles market have won at least one championship.

Thilo Kunkel, an associate professor at Temple University who studies sports branding, said it is possible, and necessary, for a team to build a brand independent of winning championships. He pointed to London, which has more than a dozen professional soccer teams, many of which have robust fan bases even when they are struggling.
“Winning a championship is really putting all eggs in one basket, and that’s a basket everyone else wants as well,” Kunkel said. “A strategic way to build a brand community is creating a vision — who we are, what we stand for.”
Both Kunkel and Demoff said the Clippers’ move to their own arena will be important to that end.
“They’ve done a really nice job of finding their own lane in the sports brand world in Los Angeles, and now they can fully lean into that rather than having to take down signage from one game in 12 hours and put up something,” Demoff said.
Ballmer’s financial commitment to differentiating the Clippers applies on and off the court. The team said it spent $10 million resurfacing 350 basketball courts in community parks around Los Angeles, and others in Inglewood, Moreno Valley (Leonard’s hometown) and Palmdale (George’s hometown). Ballmer spent $2 billion to buy the team, and he is financing the new arena, the $2 billion Intuit Dome.
As the Clippers studied seating options for the new arena, they built more than 20 sets of small-scale grandstands, and Ballmer sat in all of them. In downtown Los Angeles at the Intuit Dome Experience Center, which includes sample suites and seating options, visitors can test the seats with haptic feedback (not spikes) that the team ultimately decided were too jarring. Ballmer’s goal is personalization: Clippers fans will even have some control over the temperature in their sections.

To help amplify the crowd noise and create the kind of supporters section that is common in soccer stadiums, one side of the arena will have what Ballmer calls the “Wall of Sound”: 4,700 seats lined up without breaks for stairs or aisles.
He has consulted his players and coaches about what to include in their new practice courts and locker rooms.

The players, of course, are the key to the whole revitalization.
There was a time when it would have been unthinkable that superstars would choose the Clippers. Paul, after all, arrived via trade, and the team drafted Griffin No. 1 overall in 2009. But both Leonard and George spurned overtures from the Lakers and have settled in with the Clippers.
“People like Kawhi because he’s soft-spoken — he don’t speak,” said Darrell Bailey, the superfan better known as Clipper Darrell. He added that he loved Leonard’s attitude. “At the end of the day, Kawhi comes and does his job.”

The Clippers have kept a talented supporting cast around their stars, giving them the second-highest payroll in the N.B.A. For Ballmer, that could mean a big luxury tax bill, the financial penalty for the league’s biggest spenders.
“I’ll pay it,” he said with a little sigh and shrug. In September, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $83 billion.
“I’ve been extremely blessed financially,” Ballmer said. “Am I kind of an open checkbook where, you know, nothing’s too big? I don’t know. No one’s tested me on that. But I’m willing to spend.”

The Clippers said they had seen a return on Ballmer’s investment. They hired three sports and consumer research agencies to study their fan base and found that it had more than tripled between 2014 and 2021. The Clippers said ticket sales and sponsorship revenue had also increased during that time.

“You’ve finally got an owner that cares,” Pierce said.
Before the season, Ballmer was asked if he was excited that the Clippers seemed to be healthy. He clapped his hands and the sound boomed as though a large balloon had just popped. Then he grinned and stuck out his tongue, lifting both feet off the ground as he rubbed his hands together.
“Ohhh, yes, I am!” he said. “Yes, I am!”
But Leonard, who missed last season with a knee injury, has played in just six of the team’s 25 games this year because of injuries. George recently missed seven straight games with his injuries. The Clippers are 14-11 — better than the Lakers but below reasonable hopes for a team with such big-name stars.
While they are not resting all of their brand-building hopes on winning championships, they know how important on-court success is. Lest they forget, there are constant reminders of the championship expectations for Los Angeles sports teams. Some have won quickly after joining the fray, while the Clippers have yet to win a title in nearly four decades in Los Angeles.
On Nov. 12, members of Los Angeles F.C., an expansion soccer team that played its first game in 2018, visited the Clippers. They brought along a prop that Ballmer posed with: the M.L.S. Cup trophy — their first — they had won a week before.

After months of detention in Russia, Brittany Griner was finally released in a prisoner exchange.

A U.S. prisoner swap with Russia
Brittney Griner, the American basketball star imprisoned in Russia, was released in an exchange for the convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. President Biden said Griner had landed safely in the United Arab Emirates and would be back in the U.S. within 24 hours.
The trade ended 10 months of captivity for Griner, who was arrested just before Russia invaded Ukraine and found guilty of trying to smuggle illegal narcotics into Russia for carrying vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. She was sentenced to nine years in one of Russia’s most feared penal colonies.
Bout, who earned the nickname “Merchant of Death,” was orldfreed after serving less than half of his 25-year prison sentence. Accused of supplying weapons to Al Qaeda, the Taliban and rebels in Rwanda, Bout was arrested in Thailand in 2008 and convicted in New York in 2011 on charges including conspiring to kill Americans.
Context: The swap may have been an effort by President Vladimir Putin’s government to divert attention from Russia’s flailing war effort in Ukraine. Kremlin supporters greeted the exchange as a notable Russian victory.
Left behind? The U.S. had initially offered to release Bout for two Americans: Griner and Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive, who was arrested at a Moscow hotel in December 2018. Biden says his administration is still working on getting Whelan released.

China courts the Arab world
The Chinese leader Xi Jinping began a visit to Saudi Arabia that showcased the growing ties between Beijing and Riyadh. Leaders from other Gulf and Arab countries are traveling to Saudi Arabia for a series of summits with Xi.
“This will be the largest and highest-level diplomatic event between China and the Arab world since the founding of the People’s Republic of China,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, told reporters.
Xi and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, signed a strategic partnership agreement reflecting their growing alliance on oil, arms, technology and infrastructure.
Saudi Arabia has been a close American ally for more than half a century, and the U.S. remains the kingdom’s main security guarantor. But the Saudi rulers have long sought to strengthen other alliances to prepare for what they see as an emerging multipolar world, with China as a key superpower.

U.S. passes same-sex marriage bill
The House of Representatives gave final approval to the measure, with lawmakers from both parties voting in favor. It now goes to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.
The bill, which mandates federal recognition for same-sex marriages, highlights a significant shift in American politics and culture on an issue that was once considered politically divisive.
Over the past decade, same-sex marriage has become widely accepted by members of both parties, and polls show that more than 70 percent of voters in the U.S. support same-sex marriage.

Harry and Meghan, ‘personal and raw’
The Netflix series “Harry and Meghan” is one of the most anticipated television spectacles of the year — more media event than documentary.
Encouraged by friends to document their dramatic decision to “step back” as senior members of the British royal family, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, shot more than 15 hours of personal video in the early months of 2020 as they finalized their plans to exit Buckingham Palace.
The first three episodes, which were released Thursday, focus on the couple’s complaints about Britain’s news media, reveal details of Meghan’s rocky relationship with her relatives, and claim that some royals viewed harassment as a “rite of passage.” Here are the main takeaways.
Three new episodes will be released on Dec. 15.

A video-game battle for the ages
The Biden administration yesterday took its boldest step yet in challenging the reach of tech giants when the F.T.C. sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard.
The move is meant to prevent Microsoft from consolidating power in the video-game industry, but it also represents something bigger. The F.T.C. under Lina Khan wants to rewrite the nation’s antitrust approach to Big Tech and mergers.
The F.T.C. warned about serious blows to competition. Activision, the publisher of hit games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush, has almost 370 million active users each month. Putting it together with Microsoft, which owns the Xbox platform, would run the risk that popular titles would be withheld from rival platforms, according to the agency.
Microsoft has argued that doing so would not make economic sense, and recently agreed to make Call of Duty available to Nintendo for 10 years. (It has extended a similar offer to Sony.) But the F.T.C. is leery of such promises: It cited Microsoft making two titles exclusive to its platforms, despite pledging to European authorities that it had no incentive to do so.
The lawsuit is Microsoft’s biggest challenge in Washington in two decades, when the Justice Department sued the company over its dominance of personal computing. Since then, Microsoft has sought to paint itself as a good corporate citizen, standing with the government on issues like providing A.I. to the Pentagon and arguing against other companies’ closed app ecosystems.
Microsoft pledged to fight this case. “While we believed in giving peace a chance, we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court,” Brad Smith, its president, said in a statement.

The Biden administration has made reining in big tech companies a priority. Perhaps the strongest signal was the government’s pick for the top antitrust enforcers: Jonathan Kanter, head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, and Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
Both are progressives who want to toughen enforcement and stretch antitrust doctrine. Under Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. has aggressively challenged acquisitions — a quick-strike tool in the antitrust arsenal to prevent the tech industry’s giants from getter bigger.

On Thursday, the agency filed suit to block Microsoft’s $69 billion purchase of video game maker Activision Blizzard, which would be the largest technology deal in decades. And on the same day, it deployed a novel argument to stop a relatively tiny acquisition by Meta, arguing in a California court that the $400 million deal by Facebook’s parent company would harm future competition in the emerging market for virtual reality apps.
Stopping a corporate purchase is one thing. But the larger agenda for the Biden administration’s antitrust enforcers involves major cases that accuse Big Tech of being bullying monopolists. Those cases involve long periods of document collection, deposition taking and courtroom wrangling.
For example, the Justice Department has for over a year been investigating whether Google abuses its dominance of online ad technology to stifle competition. No final decision has been made, but if the lawsuit moves ahead in the coming months it could very likely take years for the case to work its way through the courts. The risk is not only that the ad technology at issue may be obsolete, but also that current and would-be rivals will have abandoned or avoided the market.
The stately pace of traditional antitrust action is also evident in the Justice Department’s first salvo against Google. The suit challenging the company’s behavior in the search market was filed two years ago. It is not expected to go to trial for another year, and even then, with appeals that could go all the way to the Supreme Court, the case may not be resolved till 2027 or later, legal experts say.
If the government wins these cases, a court could order breaking up a company or lasting changes in its behavior. But they are costly, high-stakes legal ventures.

There’s another way to ensure giant tech companies do not abuse their market power, say some antitrust experts and lawmakers. The largest American banks are classified as “systemically important financial institutions” by federal regulators and subject to more stringent scrutiny. And the big telecommunications corporations are designated “common carriers” with obligations to allow access to their networks to other companies. A similar approach could work for Big Tech, they say.
Instead of relying only on antitrust laws and the courts, new rules that apply specifically to tech giants could prevent them from unfairly using their market power to steer users to their products and services. For example, such rules could require the companies to offer open and fair access to their platforms, enable data sharing with new entrants and offer data portability to consumers.
In Congress, there has been some momentum for adopting new rules and regulations. “It is past time to update our competition laws for the digital era,” Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said.
The E.U. and Britain are taking the lead
A bill introduced by Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa last year singled out four tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, which is owned by Alphabet — and aimed to ban them from prioritizing their services over competitors. The bill gained bipartisan support and was endorsed by the Justice Department. But the legislation stalled in the Senate, after the companies spent millions lobbying against the law.

Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, introduced legislation to create a Digital Platform Commission — similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission for finance and the Federal Communications Commission for telecom — that would be able to designate “systemically important digital platforms” subject to additional oversight.

In the European Union and Britain, lawmakers have been more successful in passing legislation to limit the power of Big Tech. The European Parliament’s Digital Markets Act went into force last month. It includes a list of rules and obligations that will apply to companies it deems “gatekeepers” and leaves it up to those companies to figure out how to comply. By 2024, if regulators find the steps a company proposes to be insufficient, it could be fined up to 10 percent of its worldwide revenue or even face a breakup order. (Europe’s antitrust officials are also scrutinizing the Microsoft-Activision deal.)
Britain has a different model that gives big tech companies more of a role in determining their commitments. It set up a Digital Markets Unit to oversee a code of conduct, developing rules tailored for each company. Rishi Sunak, the new prime minister, was a supporter of the regulatory concept as chancellor of the Exchequer, and legislation describing the nondiscrimination rules and the enforcement duties of the digital markets unit is expected in the current session of parliament.
The regulatory experiments in the E.U. member states and in Britain could help to inform American policy and court-ordered remedies, said Fiona Scott Morton, an economist at the Yale School of Management.
“We can pick and choose what seems to be working,” said Ms. Scott Morton, who was an antitrust official in the Obama administration.
‘A window for the big tech players’
Mandated data sharing and interoperability, proponents say, could bring more competition and new offerings for consumers. For example, shoppers could take their past purchase history from Amazon and use it to improve their recommendations from another store. Or a new social network, catering to privacy-conscious users, could connect a person to their Facebook friends without giving Facebook their personal information. More generally, proponents say, seamless interconnection to the big digital platforms could be a boon to entrepreneurs building products and services on top of the platforms — and foster more competition among the tech giants.

And the designations of dominant companies could be fluid. “You want a system where, after shifts in the market and technology, companies and services can come off the list,” said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former senior official in the Justice Department’s antitrust division in the Obama administration.
Even if the government prevails in court against Big Tech, the chances of Google being unseated in search or Amazon becoming an also-ran in e-commerce are slight, said Gene Kimmelman, who was also a senior official in the antitrust division under President Barack Obama. “But you can create more competitive tension in these markets and more openings for mix-and-match technologies.”
Tech companies warn that overly broad regulation can slow innovation, reduce investment and hamper product development, making their products and services harder to use and less useful. They also say there may be unintended consequences if regulators do not carefully weigh trade-offs involving competition, privacy and content moderation. For example, mandated data sharing could undermine privacy if security is less stringent at organizations receiving a person’s information.
In the European Union and Britain, the companies have no choice but to embark on the path of regulation. Better to engage than resist. Even the Digital Markets Act has a provision for “regulatory dialogue,” leaving some room to tweak how the law is carried out.
The potential payoff for big tech companies is that they would have competition rules for the future — a code of conduct that the companies can live with and government regulators worldwide can accept.

Philip Verveer, a Washington lawyer who served in four administrations as an antitrust official and telecommunications regulator, said that more regulation might actually be a relief to big tech companies.

2022-12-11,"LOS ANGELES — Karen Bass was sworn in as the first female mayor of Los Angeles on Sunday and vowed to build consensus among elected leaders as Angelenos contend with racial tensions, surging homelessness and a new rise in coronavirus cases.
Vice President Kamala Harris swore in Ms. Bass in a ceremony that celebrated her historic win but also underscored the obstacles she will face. Ms. Bass said that her first act as mayor on Monday would be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness.
“If we are going to bring Angelenos inside and move our city in a new direction,” Ms. Bass said during her inaugural speech, which was interrupted by protesters at one point, “we must have a single strategy to unite our city and county and engage the state, the federal government, the private sector and every other stakeholder.”
Ms. Bass, a former Democratic congresswoman who was on the shortlist to be President Biden’s 2020 running mate, won election against Rick Caruso, a billionaire real estate developer, in a hard-fought race that remained too close to call until a week after the election.

Los Angeles, a city of four million people, has been rocked by a surge in post-pandemic homelessness and violent crime, prompting an outcry from citizens who say their quality of life has spiraled in recent years. A citywide poll conducted early this year by the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University found that for the first time since 2012, a majority of Angelenos felt the city was going in the wrong direction.
The coronavirus itself also remains a scourge: Officials at the event required attendees to wear masks amid an alarming rise in case numbers in the city.
Homelessness in America
New York City: An annual count by the city found more than 4,100 people sleeping on streets and in subways. It was the most since the city began keeping track nearly two decades ago.
A New Type of Care: Programs are sprouting across the country to provide nursing home and rehabilitation services to homeless people who would otherwise shuttle between hospitals and the street.
Making Music: Therapists from the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music have found that teaching homeless children to make beats and write songs is a way to heal trauma.
What Would Jesus Do?: The “Yes in God’s Backyard” movement to build affordable housing on faith organizations’ properties is gaining steam in California and elsewhere.
Ms. Bass, 69, said she entered the race because the heightened racial divisions and civic unease reminded her of the unrest that preceded the riots that tore the city apart in 1992. In September, her home was burglarized. Ms. Bass, who has long been an advocate for liberal crime prevention policies, promised during her campaign to put more police officers on the streets.
She has also promised to declare a state of emergency on homelessness and find homes for 17,000 homeless people in her first year. In practice, she will have to rely on a broad coalition of city and county officials to enact any sweeping plans to bolster social service programs. According to a September report from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, some 69,000 people are experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County.
Fesia Davenport, the chief executive of Los Angeles County, attended Ms. Bass’s swearing-in ceremony. She said she was hopeful that the new mayor would collaborate with the county to help address homelessness.

Ms. Davenport said she did not usually attend political events but made an exception this time.
“I wanted to help celebrate and commemorate this momentous occasion,” Ms. Davenport said. “I really feel like she has signaled that she’s willing to tackle the really tough issues, not just manage them.”
Though voters have said they are frustrated and cynical about whether a course correction is possible, thousands gathered at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday to celebrate the election of the first woman to lead the city and the second Black mayor after Tom Bradley, who retired in 1993 as the longest-tenured executive in Los Angeles history. Ms. Bass is the latest in a growing number of women who have been elected to local leadership positions.
The ceremony featured musicians including Stevie Wonder — whose performance of “Living for the City” brought the new mayor to her feet — Chloe Bailey and the duo Mary Mary. The event also featured a reading from the poet Amanda Gorman, who ended with a line that drew a standing ovation: “Where there’s a will, there is women, and where there’s women, there’s forever a way.”
Attendees wore rain jackets and carried umbrellas as they waited to go through security. Some were decked out in suits, others in sequins and Santa hats. While the lines wound through the L.A. Live complex, guests held out their phones to snap selfies in front of the theater’s marquee, showing Ms. Bass’s smiling face and her motto: “A New Day for Los Angeles.”
Earle Charles, a professor at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, Calif., approached the front of the line for his first mayoral inauguration in Los Angeles, where he has lived for almost four decades. He said he is a longtime supporter of Ms. Bass and trusts her to carry through on her campaign promises.

“One of the first things, of course, is to take care of the homeless situation,” said Mr. Charles, 69, who lives in Granada Hills in the San Fernando Valley. “To me, that’s the primary issue.”
Other attendees agreed that homelessness should be at the top of the new mayor’s agenda. Bertha Scott-Smith, 54, said she felt as though Ms. Bass’s predecessor, Eric Garcetti, had not had the easiest time making real progress on the issue.
“I hope she doesn’t meet that same pushback,” said Ms. Scott-Smith, who lives in the historically Black neighborhood of Leimert Park.
She said that Ms. Bass’s inauguration felt like a historic moment, particularly with the vice president attending.
Ms. Harris — the first female vice president, the first woman of color to hold her job, a former California attorney general and a former senator — flew to Los Angeles for the occasion with a planeload of Democrats. The roster included Delegate Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands and Representatives Frederica S. Wilson of Florida, Bobby L. Rush of Illinois, Nanette Barragán of California and Tony Cárdenas of California.

Kirsten Allen, the vice president’s spokeswoman, said that Ms. Bass had asked Ms. Harris to swear her in, and the vice president obliged.
“The vice president is invested in her success and knows what she’s up against,” Ms. Allen said, “and will do what she needs to do to make sure she’s successful.”
At the ceremony, Tamaqua Jackson, wrapped in a beret and a scarf, said she believed in Ms. Bass’s ability to tackle homelessness and also help heal a splintered city.
“She seems like she can bring Los Angeles together as one,” Ms. Jackson said, adding that she would like to see Ms. Bass “clean up” the City Council, which has been besieged by controversy in recent months.
Ms. Jackson, 48, has lived in Los Angeles all her life, but this was her first mayoral inauguration, she said. She said the vice president’s appearance added to the appeal of attending in person.

Elon Musk divulges his preferred pronouns.

Why Elon Musk might be taking on Anthony Fauci
Since taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has shown a willingness, and sometimes a relish, to pick public fights with an array of targets, including advertisers, tech giants, employees and more.
But over the weekend, Musk publicly attacked two figures, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, in ways that may resonate with far-right audiences and gin up user engagement — but are likely to deter wary advertisers from flocking back to the social network anytime soon.
“My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,” Musk tweeted on Sunday, scoring points with both critics of the use of nonbinary pronouns and of Mr. Fauci, America’s top immunologist, who disagreed with President Donald Trump on how to reopen the country in 2020. Mr. Musk has previously criticized pandemic lockdowns, having defied one that affected Tesla’s factory in California, and remote work. (Mr. Fauci himself wrote in a Times Opinion guest essay how political divisiveness has hampered public health campaigns.)
Musk’s tweet drew predictable responses, including support from far-right figures like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and rebukes from Democratic lawmakers like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Some on Twitter noted that Musk’s own predictions about the pandemic fell drastically short of reality.

Mr. Musk also spread misinformation about Mr. Roth, misleadingly suggesting that the former Twitter executive’s doctoral thesis advocated for child sexualization. The move opened up Mr. Roth — whom Mr. Musk had publicly supported in the first days of his Twitter ownership, before Mr. Roth quit — to online abuse.
Musk says that he has focused relentlessly on improving public safety on Twitter, and accused previous management of failing to do so. But Jack Dorsey, the company’s co-founder and former C.E.O., disputed that assertion. And three members of Twitter’s Trust & Safety Council announced their resignation last week, citing the company’s increased reliance on automated content moderation.
Is Musk banking on conservative engagement to help Twitter’s business? Musk has pointed to some metrics showing that user engagement is up since he took over. The billionaire may well be politically conservative, but evidence of his actual positions isn’t very clear. In any case, his actions — which also include leaking internal Twitter correspondence about topics like Hunter Biden to sympathetic journalists including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss — have certainly succeeded in winning over right-leaning users and conservative politicians.
But Mr. Musk’s shock tactics don’t seem to be designed to bring back advertisers who paused spending on Twitter amid the chaos during his takeover. (Apple, which was the target of a brief Musk campaign but which hasn’t halted ads on the platform, declined to comment to DealBook on Musk’s latest tweets.) That puts additional importance on Twitter’s efforts to expand revenue beyond ads, including the revamped Twitter Blue subscription service that is set to debut today.
Nor do they seem likely to endear the company to prospective recruits who may already be wary of workplace culture changes that Mr. Musk has wrought. Insider noted that employees had warned prospective hires via the anonymous employer-rating site Blind to stay away from the company and its “toxic” environment.
Mr. Musk certainly didn’t win over the crowd at a Dave Chappelle comedy show on Sunday in San Francisco: He was heavily booed after making a surprise appearance onstage.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Microsoft buys a 4 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange Group. The American software giant acquired the stake from a group led by Thomson Reuters and Blackstone, as part of a $2.8 billion deal that will have the exchange rely on Microsoft’s cloud services. It follows similar business partnerships by other exchanges, including Nasdaq (with Amazon) and CME Group (with Alphabet).
Amgen agrees to buy Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion. The all-cash deal for Horizon, which produces treatments for autoimmune diseases, is the biggest health care transaction of the year. In beating out rivals like Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, Amgen is paying a nearly 20 percent premium to Horizon’s stock price on Friday.
European lawmakers grapple with a Qatar bribery scandal. Over the weekend, the Belgian authorities charged four people with corruption in connection with an investigation into suspected bribes by the Gulf state to current and former members of the European Parliament.

Stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai closed lower on Monday as concerns grow over the rate of Covid infections in major Chinese cities, after Beijing suddenly eased many of its zero-Covid restrictions. That is feeding into global slowdown fears, which are affecting energy prices. As of 7 a.m. Eastern, Brent crude was down roughly 0.7 percent.
The S&P 500 Index has fallen in nine of the past 11 trading sessions, as recession and inflation fears mount, pushing investors to pare their stock holdings. The benchmark index slumped 3.4 percent last week, its worst weekly performance since September, according to Deutsche Bank equities analysts.

And on Wednesday, the Fed will announce what is expected to be a 0.5 percentage point interest rate increase. That same afternoon, the Fed chair, Jay Powell, will deliver his latest assessment of the economy, and is expected to signal the central bank’s policy moves for next year.
It’s a similar picture in Europe. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England will also deliver rates decisions this week, and similarly sized increases are expected. And investors will be tracking consumer price data releases from France, Germany and the U.K., where soaring energy and food prices have pushed core inflation to multidecade highs.

As two congressional committees gear up to scrutinize the multibillion-dollar collapse of crypto empire FTX this week, its fallen founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, still seems to believe in the future of the company, and in his role as a business leader.
Mr. Bankman-Fried hopes to start a new venture, he told the BBC on Saturday, explaining that the goal would be to repay FTX investors. The comments were made a day after he weighed in on a proposal to revive FTX by issuing a new version of the exchange’s token, FTT, writing on Twitter that it would be “a productive path for parties to explore!” The price of FTT rose on his tweet, but the statements would have come as little consolation to FTX’s million creditors.
“I won’t be as helpful as I’d like,” Bankman-Fried warned. He is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, but the former FTX chief executive said there were limits on what he would be able to say because he does not have access to all of his personal or professional data.
It’s not clear whether Mr. Bankman-Fried, who is known as S.B.F., will appear in person. He has also not yet accepted a request to talk to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.

Staying silent may be difficult. The hearing will pit Mr. Bankman-Fried against John Ray, the restructuring expert and current FTX C.E.O. who is managing the bankruptcy and labeled FTX the worst case of corporate failure he had ever seen. S.B.F. has pushed back against that characterization, claiming Mr. Ray made “false” statements in court filings about FTX’s failure.
Mr. Ray reportedly met with Manhattan prosecutors last week. They are apparently looking into suspicious transfers to the Bahamas on the eve of FTX filing for bankruptcy, among other aspects of the collapse.

Other executives are being more circumspect. At least in public. Caroline Ellison, the former C.E.O. of Alameda Research, FTX’s sister trading firm that allegedly used FTX customer funds to back its very risky bets, has stayed quiet — even as Bankman-Fried has tried to shift blame on to her.  Ms. Ellison has reportedly hired a former S.E.C. official steeped in crypto cases, Stephanie Avakian, as her lawyer. Last week, Ms. Ellison was reportedly spotted in a coffee shop not far from the offices of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, giving rise to speculation that she may be cooperating with their investigation.
Here’s what else is happening in crypto today:
South Korean prosecutors believe that the crypto fugitive Do Kwon, who is wanted in the $60 billion collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna tokens, is hiding in Serbia.
Investors are pulling record amounts from crypto coins following the collapse of FTX. And most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are trading lower this morning.
“There’s a risk of a recession. But … it certainly isn’t, in my view, something that is necessary to bring inflation down.”
— Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen believes inflation will fall considerably in 2023. The less-good news: she acknowledges that a downturn in the U.S. economy is a possibility.

Three major central banks — the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England — will set interest rates this week. And there is fresh inflation data coming from the U.S. and Europe.

2022-12-14,"WASHINGTON — President Biden sought to revitalize America’s listless relationship with Africa on Wednesday, promising a grab bag of economic initiatives to make up for a predecessor who had denigrated the continent and catch up with strategic competitors like China that have expanded their influence.
Assembling most of Africa’s leaders in Washington for the first time since 2014, Mr. Biden vowed to invest what aides calculated will be $55 billion on the continent over the next three years while supporting its ambitions for greater global leadership and bolstering efforts to transform it into a more prosperous, healthier and technologically advanced region.
“The United States is all in on Africa’s future,” Mr. Biden declared in an address to the delegations of 49 nations attending the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. Adapting a line he often uses to pitch domestic priorities, the president added, “Together, we want to build a future of opportunity where no one, no one, is left behind.”
The three-day gathering may go a long way toward emphasizing American support for Africa, with concrete pledges on issues of great importance. At the same time, it did not include a sweeping, inspirational initiative like President George W. Bush’s PEPFAR program to combat AIDS or President Barack Obama’s Power Africa drive to electrify tens of millions of homes. Unclear was whether Mr. Biden’s less splashy commitments would have an effect that would be noticed and positively shape perceptions of America.

The United States is widely seen as lagging behind China in cultivating Africa, a geopolitical contest that in recent years has expanded to include powers like Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated food shortages in Africa while Covid-19 has disrupted supply chains, multiplying challenges in a region with no shortage of them to begin with.
American influence in Africa dwindled under Mr. Biden’s predecessor, Donald J. Trump, who paid little attention to the continent except to deride some of its 54 nations with an expletive and to complain that after immigrants from Nigeria saw the United States, they would never “go back to their huts.” Mr. Trump spoke of Africa as if the entire continent were a single country, and once confused the name of an African nation.
Without mentioning any of that history, Mr. Biden sought to demonstrate affection for the region, celebrating the visiting African leaders and their spouses at a gala dinner at the White House featuring Gladys Knight on Wednesday night and honoring Morocco’s success as the first African nation to make the final four in the World Cup.
“I know you’re saying to yourselves, ‘Make it short, Biden, there’s a semifinal game coming up,’” he joked as he opened his speech just 13 minutes before game time. (Morocco fell to France, 2-0.)
At the dinner in the White House East Room, Mr. Biden raised the more painful history of slavery. “We remember the stolen men and women and children who were brought to our shores in chains, subjected to unimaginable cruelty — my nation’s original sin was that period,” he said. Their descendants, he added, “have helped build this country and propel it to higher heights, leading the charge, blazing new trails and forging a better future for everyone in America.”

In the course of his interactions with African leaders, the president unveiled a series of initiatives, including an agreement meant to encourage the formation of a continentwide free-trade zone that has stalled over the last few years. He vowed to help African countries do more to transition to clean energy and plug into the digital economy, a contrast to China, which has focused much of its investment in Africa on building roads, bridges, airports and other physical infrastructure.
Mr. Biden said in his keynote address that the goal was not to “create political obligation or foster dependence” but to “spur shared success,” a phrase he said characterized his approach. “Because when Africa succeeds, the United States succeeds,” he said. “Quite frankly, the whole world succeeds as well.”
The Biden administration has sought to deflect the perception that its efforts this week were aimed at competing with China, which has surpassed the United States in trade and economic cooperation with Africa.
But the emphasis put on Africa was an implicit recognition that the United States has little choice but to commit to the continent, which is projected to account for one in four people by 2050 and is rich in the resources needed to combat climate change and transition to clean energy, like vast forests and rare minerals used to power electric vehicles.

Mr. Biden’s challenge was to convince the African leaders that he was serious about wanting to trade with them. Many were openly skeptical. At a side event in Washington hours before Mr. Biden spoke, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda shrugged when asked if anything had come out of the inaugural U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit hosted by Mr. Obama in 2014.

“Well, at least we had a good meeting,” he replied, drawing laughter from the crowd.
Mr. Biden planned to return to the summit at the Washington Convention Center on Thursday for a session on the African Union’s strategic vision for the continent. Vice President Kamala Harris will host a working lunch, and Mr. Biden will close the gathering with a discussion of food security.
The Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine provided Mr. Biden with an entry point for his pitch to Africa’s leaders, reminding them that the United States delivered 231 million vaccines to 49 African countries.
Yet the war in Ukraine also underscored the scale of American priorities. A mistake by Mr. Biden in his speech underscored the context. He described a digital economy initiative for Africa as a $350 billion investment, when in fact it will be $350 million, as noted in the official White House transcript correcting the president’s error. By contrast, the Biden administration and Congress have committed $66 billion to the war in Ukraine and the White House has just asked Congress for another $37.7 billion.
Some analysts wondered whether the roster of projects ticked off by the president and his aides this week would be more effective than a single broad initiative like those introduced by Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama.
“When I hear a laundry list, a long list of investments, that’s just showing what the U.S. is doing,” said Aubrey Hruby of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council. “But I don’t know if that sinks in very well. Whereas with Power Africa it was simpler, perhaps more memorable. It drew on the power of the podium.”

“The key,” she added, “will be what people remember one month from now. Or one year from now. What becomes real.”
The digital economy project includes a partnership with Microsoft and programs to train African entrepreneurs to write code. “American big tech recognizes that the demographic future of this world is African,” Ms. Hruby said. “A million Africans turn 18 every month. This is the future.”
As ever in this week’s summit, China was the unspoken factor. When Mr. Biden announced $800 million in new contracts for Cisco Systems and a smaller company named Cybastion “to protect African countries from cyberthreats,” it offered a counterpoint to the dominance of Huawei, the Chinese technology firm whose cellphones and computers systems are ubiquitous across Africa, stoking fears that Beijing could use them for cyberespionage.
The Biden administration this week announced its support for an initiative to use minerals mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo to make batteries for electric vehicles in factories in neighboring Zambia. That deal meets the African goal of keeping supply chains for one of the world’s hottest new businesses on the continent.
It also meets an American strategic objective, countering worries in Washington that China is obtaining a stranglehold on rare minerals in countries like Congo.

The administration also signed a memorandum of understanding to support the African Continental Free Trade Area, which was started in 2019 and promises to unlock the enormous economic potential of a continent of 1.3 billion people and a total market of $3.4 trillion by easing trade barriers between individual countries.
Africa’s mostly colonial-era borders are further heightened by protectionist policies, poor transport links and other measures that hinder trade. The free-trade area could increase intra-Africa trade by up to one-quarter, or $70 billion, by 2040, helping to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty, according to the United Nations and the World Bank. But implementation has been slow, and experts say that assistance from the United States and other foreign powers is needed to bolster its chances of success.
Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said the current administration has been working hard to restore ties to Africa over the nearly two years since Mr. Trump left office.
“Look, any time an administration chooses not to put as much energy or emphasis into a place, it obviously has some ramifications,” he told reporters this week. But “we believe that we are not coming into this summit from a standing start. We’re coming into this summit with a head of steam around a set of issues that this summit, I think, is going to kick into a higher gear.”"
2022-12-15,"Color spills into the lobby of the Museum of Modern Art, radiating from a 3-D animation of sloshing, puffy liquid fizzing in ectoplasmic earth-tones and rancid pastels. This is Refik Anadol’s “Unsupervised,” and the roiling shapes greeting visitors from a 24-foot-high wall of LEDs are the museum’s collection of art, design and photography — analyzed, digitized, fed to an algorithm and returned as spectacular slurry.
Anadol, 37, is a digital artist known for using A.I. to turn piles of data into spectral, abstract visuals, often at huge scale. To do this, he has partnered with the likes of Microsoft, MIT and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 2018, for example, with Google’s help, Anadol projected mind-bending pictures based on the complete archive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic onto the exterior of Disney Hall. An upcoming show at Jeffrey Deitch in Los Angeles promises wavelike imagery stirred by observations of the Pacific Ocean.

This time, it’s MoMA’s collection behind the globs and blobs. Informed by nearly every object in the museum’s collection, “Unsupervised” automates a modernist notion of progress: input art history, output the next avant-garde. This context draws out some of the most interesting questions around “big data,” A.I. and creativity. How should we process the past? How can MoMA, the mausoleum of yesterday’s radical art, stay relevant? Not least, the impulse to make computers do something “artistic” speaks to our anxiety around what makes us human — if software can create art, then what’s left for us?

It’s a fearsome question. Anadol doesn’t answer it here. In his positivist vision, both progress and existential doubt have the breathless optimism of a TED Talk. Anadol describes his work as machine “hallucinations” and “dreams,” which is apt — the software interpolates the images it’s been given in a way that seems extra-real, vertiginous and wrong. In the argot of A.I. engineers, a program “hallucinates” when it generates falsehoods.
“Unsupervised” belongs to a burgeoning class of software known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), where one part of the code tries to trick another part with imitations of whatever it’s been trained on, whether profile pictures or “Seinfeld” episodes. Here, software weaned on images and metadata — names, dimensions, materials — of MoMA’s holdings generates what it determines are new works of art. These creations are tweaked using real-time data like local weather and the motion of visitors, and displayed on the media wall in one of three morphing styles (officially, three distinct works): mottled blooms, skittering rays or molten Floam. A cosmic, swishing soundtrack issues from a pair of speakers.

In the last few years, as GAN-based programs like OpenAI’s Dall-E (get it?) and Google’s Deep Dream have become public, many users have tested the apps’ ability to reproduce or revise the greatest hits of art history, usually in the oversimplified way that “immersive experiences” riff on van Gogh or Kahlo.

The photographer Torbjørn Rødland, meanwhile, has used Dall-E to recreate masterpieces of photography and photohistory —from Henri Cartier-Bresson to William Eggleston — that reside at MoMA, but with a more critical eye.
His experiments don’t celebrate the technology, but demonstrate its shortcomings and sullenness. Try asking a text-to-image A.I. for “the decisive moment.” Whatever the technology sutures together will include the unsatisfying shadow of Cartier-Bresson, the street photographer who coined the concept — just as the contours of popular works appear when you type “Picasso” or “Kusama”; “trail cam” or “fisheye skateboard video.”

MoMA’s founding director Alfred Barr and first photo curator Beaumont Newhall started acquiring and exhibiting photography before the technical medium’s status as fine art was settled. The museum is doing the same with digital media, even as similar skepticism toward machine-made imagery echoes around A.I.-generated work. (Anadol and MoMA’s curators alluded to this reprise of history in a public conversation.)
This September, MoMA announced the sale of masterworks by Francis Bacon, Pierre Bonnard and others, under its care since 1990 (though not strictly in its collection), in order to endow its expansion into digital art. They’ve also dipped a toe into NFTs with alternate versions of “Unsupervised.”

Traces of the museum’s 82-year-old photo department are churning in Anadol’s data, including pictures by Rødland. Video games like “Myst” and “The Sims,” which Paola Antonelli, a senior curator, started accessioning in 2012 are represented there too (several are currently on view in a sharp collection show of interactive design), as are the succession of modernist paintings that used to hang where “Unsupervised” now mesmerizes patrons and their children.

Presumably, the project also incorporates provocative subjects — sex, violence, racism — the long and torturous 20th century as recorded by its artists. But “Unsupervised” is so abstract you’d never know that Faith Ringgold’s “American People Series #20: Die,” a bloody tableau of a 1960s uprising, may have provided shades of yellow, brown and red. In fact, MoMA says the software is designed not to produce recognizable figures. (Other public-facing GAN products similarly avoid potentially sensitive material.) It could be anything. The work’s enveloping abstraction scuttles the possibility of conceptual dignity offered by an institution founded to embrace challenging new art.
Then, every few minutes, the big screen flickers, as if straining, and the soothing colors turn into an array of charts tracking things like “energy difference” and the “current latent noise field.” Under “GAN video analysis” there are thumbnails of the jade lumps, gold lozenges and coal-colored squares “dreamed up” by the software. It’s like the way hacking is portrayed in a Hollywood film like “Jurassic Park,” with slick but simulated interfaces, so as not to bore audiences with the reality of coding.

At MoMA, home to some of the smartest art in recent history, these theatrical peeks under the machine’s hood feel patronizing. Does it really need to flicker? Is it working that hard?
On the contrary, “Unsupervised” suggests that creating the next avant-garde should be easy, if you have enough computing power. It’s as if A.I. can do our hallucinating and dreaming for us, minus the bad trips and nightmares. But the bad trips and nightmares are still there. “Unsupervised” is only a screen saver.

2022-12-18,"In a recent speech, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo suggested an incremental shift in how the United States approaches “competitiveness and the China challenge.” She recognized the serious threat from China, explaining that the United States “will continue to press China to address its nonmarket economic practices that result in an uneven playing field.” She noted, though, that “we are not seeking the decoupling of our economy from that of China’s.”
America’s China policy does need to change. The ruthless repression of its Covid-policy protesters is the latest proof of that, but the greater urgency is that the status quo has things moving to the disadvantages of the United States as well as to the benefit of China. An incremental shift is not enough.
In order to truly ensure that economic relations between the two countries continue to be beneficial to America, it is time to adopt an explicit policy of strategic decoupling of our economy from theirs — not a total decoupling, but one that should be done over time and in an organized way.
There are two fronts in any contest with China: the economic front and the national security front. They are not entirely separate. One affects the other. And for policymakers, that is the point.

We must prepare in both spheres — economic and military — because the best way to avoid a military crisis is to maintain our economic superiority.
The purpose of strategic decoupling would be to benefit America, not to punish China or to hold it back. It has become clear that China is not a friend or a partner in development, but rather an adversary bent on world dominance.

In our economic competition, China is winning. We transfer well over $300 billion to the country annually in trade deficits, and China uses it to build its military, improve its competitiveness and buy our assets — increasingly our technology companies and even our farms. A recent report concluded that Chinese firms and investors own a controlling interest in almost 2,400 U.S. companies. China engages in technology theft, espionage and mercantilism to build what Chinese leaders believe will be the world’s dominant economy.
On the national security front, China is a big and rapidly expanding military power, and its objective is to have not just the largest but also the most sophisticated military in the world in the next decade. It is arming the South China Sea at a rate not seen since the Second World War and building military outposts in Africa and elsewhere. It is vastly increasing its nuclear arsenal and asserting territorial claims in India, the Philippines and Vietnam. It is threatening Taiwan. It has executed an agreement of friendship with “no limits” with Russia and is cooperating with the invasion of Ukraine. It has a vast campaign to influence our country, and it is responsible directly or indirectly for much of the fentanyl that is destroying many of our communities.
China’s enterprises have purchased strategic assets in Asia, Europe and South America. The country is monopolizing crucial strategic materials like rare earths, lithium and cobalt.

As if China’s aggressive turn was not clear, candid translations of proceedings at the Communist Party’s 20th National Congress in October show that they de-emphasized phrases like “peace and development” and adopted phrases like “preparing for the storm” and “the spirit of struggle.”
The U.S. objective should be to continue trade and economic activity beneficial to us and to discourage any part that is not. For example, trade in agricultural products, raw material and some consumer and pharmaceutical goods can be mutually beneficial. Importing to the United States computers, automobiles and telecommunications equipment is not.
The objective of this strategic decoupling is simple — reciprocity. It is precisely what China does to us. China has always denied us equal access to its market and has for decades pursued a policy of technological independence. China’s “indigenous innovation” policy began in 2006, and “Made in China 2025” was announced in 2015. The report of the recent 20th National Congress called for China to “increase the security and resilience of China’s own industrial supply chains.”
Strategic decoupling has several aspects. First, we should progressively impose tariffs on all of China’s imports into the United States until we have balanced trade.
Second, we should disentangle our technology. Specifically, we must enhance our export controls to further limit the kinds of technology allowed to be exported and to whom it can go. We need to stop the integration of our advanced industries by discouraging U.S. high-tech manufacturing in China and enact more policies like the CHIPS Act (which authorizes billions of dollars to help companies pay for building or expanding American computer chip factories and for research and worker training) and smart tax and regulatory policies to ensure that advanced technology stays at home or with our allies.

We should support American companies that have begun to recognize the burdens of relying on Chinese manufacturing. For example, Apple has reportedly decided to shift some of its production outside China. The company said it will look to other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, to assemble some Apple products. Likewise Microsoft and Google are moving some or all of their Xbox console and Pixel phone production. Amazon is getting many of its FireTV devices from India.
We should shut down TikTok and other social media platforms that mine our citizens’ data and serve as propaganda organs to influence our public discourse.
China has some of the strictest technology regulations in the world. It is impossible to invest in China at scale without government approval; the Chinese government almost certainly approves all outbound investment to the United States. The country’s policy is what the former Australian prime minister and China expert Kevin Rudd calls “decoupling with Chinese characteristics.”
Finally, we should limit U.S. investment going to China and China’s investment into our industries. Our investment there strengthens its economy and its military, and leads to offshoring of sometimes critical supply chains; its investment in the United States often leads to the loss of technology and sensitive data. This will prevent further economic integration and increase the availability of capital at home and in the West. No investment should be permitted in either direction unless it will strengthen America, not merely enrich a few Americans.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States — a regulatory unit in the Treasury Department — needs to be greatly expanded so that it is not limited to national security concerns but can consider other economic consequences. Last year, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission recommended in its annual report to Congress that the United States pass a similar interagency review screening program for outbound investment to China. Senators Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, have introduced legislation to this effect. It is needed.

In the Trump administration, we began the decoupling process by imposing billions of dollars of Section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports — a legal provision that allows a president to restrict foreign commerce that unfairly burdens the United States — and the expansion of export controls. We recognized the threat and acted.
That policy has been extended under President Biden: His administration kept the tariffs and further expanded export controls and is carrying out provisions of the CHIPS Act. Neither the tariffs nor the export controls have had an appreciable negative effect on our economy.
But they have begun the process of bringing manufacturing back to America and of decoupling our economies. We should do all we can to avoid a military confrontation, and we must continue to talk to and work with China in areas of mutual advantage.
But we must also act alone to begin this strategic decoupling. We cannot hide from the truth about China. Failure to act decisively now is no longer forgivable. It is dereliction.

2022-12-19,"When Epic Games released Fortnite five years ago, the video game quickly became a cultural sensation among millions of teenagers and children. It was easy to sign up and start playing and talking or text chatting with strangers through the game.
Some children also racked up hundreds of dollars on their parents’ credit cards as they bought digital items like colorful outfits for their game characters. Those purchases, along with branded merchandise like action figures, helped make Fortnite a billion-dollar blockbuster for Epic Games, with more than 400 million users.
On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of illegally collecting children’s personal information, of harming young players by matching them with strangers on Fortnite while enabling live communications and, separately, of using manipulative techniques, called “dark patterns,” to trick millions of players into making unintentional purchases. In a historic deal that puts the entire video game industry on notice, Epic agreed to pay a record $520 million in fines and refunds to settle the F.T.C.’s accusations.
The F.T.C. acted at a moment of heightened public concern over the mental health, safety and privacy risks that some popular social media networks and multiplayer video games may pose to children and teenagers.

The crackdown is also the latest indication that the agency is following through on pledges by Lina M. Khan, its chair, to take a more assertive stance toward regulating the tech industry. Earlier this month, the agency made an aggressive move to stop consolidation among video game makers when it filed a lawsuit to try to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company behind the popular Call of Duty franchise.
“Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the commission,” Ms. Khan said in a statement on Monday about the Fortnite case. “These enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the F.T.C. is cracking down on these unlawful practices.”
Epic Games said in a statement that it had instituted multiple children’s privacy and purchasing safeguards over the years and that “the practices referenced in the F.T.C.’s complaints are not how Fortnite operates.”
The company’s proposed settlement agreements with the F.T.C. involve record amounts in two separate cases as well as novel legal remedies.
Epic agreed to pay $275 million to settle regulators’ accusations that it violated a federal law, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, by collecting personal information from children under 13 who played Fortnite without obtaining verifiable consent from a parent.

In addition, the company made parents “jump through hoops” to have their children’s data deleted and sometimes failed to honor parents’ deletion requests, the agency said in a legal complaint filed on Monday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, where Epic is based.
The amount dwarfs the $170 million penalty — the previous record for child privacy violations — that Google agreed to pay in 2019 over accusations that it illegally harvested data from children on YouTube and used it to target them with ads.
Regulators and lawmakers around the world are intensifying their scrutiny of the ways popular social networks and video game companies deal with young people. In September, California enacted a sweeping online children’s safety law that will require companies to turn on the highest privacy settings for children by default and turn off certain features, like precise location tracking, that might expose them to risk.
That law is scheduled to take effect in 2024. Last week, a tech industry trade group sued the State of California in an effort to block it.
The California law came one year after Britain instituted comprehensive online protections for minors. Last year, as British regulators were developing that effort, Google, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snap, Epic Games and other major platforms announced new safeguards for younger users worldwide.

Congress is also working to boost online safety for young people.
Last year, Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, introduced a bill that would expand the federal children’s online privacy law to cover ages 13 to 16. Last week, the senator, together with several prominent children’s advocacy groups, urged members of Congress to include provisions from that children and teen privacy bill in end-of-the-year omnibus spending legislation.
“An entire generation of young people is being targeted, tracked and traumatized, as popular platforms rake in profits every day,” Mr. Markey said in a statement on Monday commending the F.T.C. for taking action against Epic Games. “Congress must meet this moment in history by stepping up and stepping in for the well-being of young people across America.”
In the privacy complaint filed on Monday, the F.T.C. said Epic had caused “substantial” injury to children by matching children and teenagers with adult strangers to play Fortnite while enabling live voice and text chats by default.
Children and teenagers had been “bullied, threatened and harassed within Fortnite, including sexually,” the complaint said, adding that some had also been exposed to traumatizing issues like suicide and self-harm through the game. Epic Games was aware of such harms, the complaint said, noting that the company’s user experience director sent an email to executives in 2017 seeking “basic toxicity prevention” for children on Fortnite and asking them to turn off voice chat.
Although Fortnite introduced some relevant privacy and parental controls over the years, regulators said the changes “have not meaningfully alleviated these harms or empowered players to avoid them.”

As part of the proposed settlement, Epic Games is required to adopt high-privacy default settings for children and teenagers, including turning off live text and voice chats by default for younger users — the first time the F.T.C. has imposed such a remedy. The company said it had already done so.
This month, Epic Games said it was introducing a new type of account for young users, called “cabined accounts,” in which features like live chat and in-app purchases are disabled by default. The company said it would default players who indicated they were under 13, or the digital age of consent in their countries, to cabined accounts and ask them to provide a parent’s email address before they could gain access to features like live voice chats.
Epic also agreed to pay $245 million to refund consumers over accusations that it used manipulative online practices to trick players of all ages into making unintended purchases. The F.T.C. announced last year that it intended to crack down on such “illegal dark patterns” that can manipulate consumers.
The amount dwarfs previous refunds in such F.T.C. cases, including a settlement last month in which Vonage, the internet phone service provider, agreed to refund $100 million to consumers over accusations that it used dark patterns to make it difficult for consumers to cancel their service.
In a separate dark patterns complaint against Epic Games, regulators said Fortnite’s user interface had a counterintuitive, inconsistent and confusing layout that led users to incur charges with the press of a single button. Players could be charged while trying to activate the game from sleep mode or while the game was loading a screen, the complaint said. Children ended up racking up charges without their parents’ knowledge.

Despite a range of complaints from players and pleas from employees, the company used manipulative tactics to deter consumers from canceling unauthorized charges or requesting refunds, regulators said. These dark-pattern techniques resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted charges for users, the agency said.
In a statement, Epic said that, in a fast-moving video game industry, longstanding industry standards were no longer enough to protect players.
“No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here,” the company said in a statement. “We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.”
Well before the F.T.C. action on Monday, British legislators pushed for stronger safeguards for children on propulsive, multiplayer video games. In a parliamentary hearing on immersive and potentially addictive technologies in 2019, members of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee grilled video game company officials about children signing up for accounts and racking up purchases without parental knowledge or consent.
“So there is no age verification at all to start with?” Ian C. Lucas, then a member of Parliament for the Labor Party, asked during the hearing about users who start playing Fortnite.

“No. We don’t collect that information,” Matthew Weissinger, the vice president of marketing at Epic Games replied.
Epic Games instituted age verification for children in Britain last year, requiring users under 13 to obtain verified consent from a parent before they could use Fortnite."

On March 10, two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the White House convened a Zoom call with 30 prominent TikTok creators. Jen Psaki, then the White House press secretary, and members of the National Security Council staff briefed the creators, who together had tens of millions of followers, on the latest news from the conflict and the White House’s goals and priorities. The meeting followed a similar effort the previous summer, in which the White House recruited dozens of TikTokers to help encourage young people to get vaccinated against Covid.
The app had only become more popular in the intervening months. “We recognize this is a critically important avenue in the way the American public is finding out about the latest,” the White House director of digital strategy, Rob Flaherty, told the assembled group. “So we wanted to make sure you had the latest information from an authoritative source.” Yet at the same time, the Biden administration was more than a year into negotiations with ByteDance, the Chinese company that created and owns TikTok, about national security concerns surrounding the app. In fact, the White House staff members who organized and briefed the TikTok creators were barred from downloading the app on their work phones.
The administration’s contradictory approach to TikTok — its embrace of the app as a vital conduit to the public, and its fear of the app as a potential tool of foreign influence — is perhaps a fitting response to the utterly unique problem that TikTok poses. Seemingly overnight, TikTok has managed to remake American culture both low and high, from media and music to memes and celebrity, in its own image. TikTok turned Olivia Rodrigo into a household name and propelled the author Colleen Hoover to the top of the best-seller list, with more copies sold this year than the Bible. TikTok coined “quiet quitting,” one of the hallmark phrases of 2022, and introduced a whole new dialect of algospeak — “seggs,” “unalive,” “le dollar bean” — that is now spreading across pop culture. Corporations and brands, from Goldfish crackers to Prada, have redirected billions of dollars worth of advertising to the platform in recognition of its all-encompassing reach, which can, at seemingly any moment, turn even a decades-old product into a must-have item. Last year, TikTok had more site visits than Google, and more watch minutes in the United States than YouTube. Facebook took almost nine years to reach one billion users; TikTok did it in five.
The app’s extraordinary success is made even more remarkable by the fact that it is a product of America’s greatest geopolitical rival. Despite decades of trying, no Chinese company has ever conquered American society like TikTok. It’s difficult to imagine a Russian or Iranian company — or, increasingly, even another Chinese company — pulling off a similar feat. TikTok’s provenance has stoked persistent and longstanding worries about its vulnerability to exploitation and manipulation by the Chinese government. Over the last year in particular, TikTok has faced an unceasing stream of bad press, with each week seeming to bring a fresh revelation about the company’s questionable data practices and spotty internal safeguards. In just the last six months, TikTok and ByteDance have been accused of lying about the access of China-based employees to American user data, using a news app to push pro-Beijing content abroad and allowing Chinese state media accounts to run unchecked and unlabeled as they criticized the American political process.
If TikTok’s popularity has thus far provided it some insulation against government action, the app’s time may be running out. In November, Brendan Carr, a commissioner of the F.C.C., said it should be banned outright. Senator Mark Warner, co-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said of a ban, “The sooner we bite the bullet, the better.” Christopher Wray, director of the F.B.I., told Congress he was “extremely concerned” about TikTok’s operations in the United States. Earlier this month, Senator Marco Rubio introduced legislation that would effectively prevent TikTok from operating in the United States by banning all apps “subject to substantial influence” by China, Russia and other foreign adversaries.
The Biden administration, meanwhile, is said to be nearing a deal with TikTok. Speaking at a conference of tech leaders, Kemba Walden, the principal deputy national cyber director, said that the White House had not made any final decision on a ban, but voiced support for “any measure that will raise security.” Maryland, South Dakota, South Carolina, Nebraska, Texas, Alabama and Utah have already banned use of the app on state devices. A bill passed by the U.S. Senate last week would do the same at the federal level. The military has also barred the app from government devices.

2022-12-22,"Early this month, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, met with Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, to push for regulatory approval of Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of the video game company Activision Blizzard.
Mr. Smith’s gambit — which included offering to keep Activision’s blockbuster game Call of Duty widely available to satisfy competitive concerns — failed. A day after their meeting, Ms. Khan’s agency sued to prevent the blockbuster deal.
But in an interview this week, Mr. Smith was sanguine. “She did not take me up on my offer, but when I said give peace a chance, she smiled at least a little,” he said of Ms. Khan. “So any time somebody can end a meeting by smiling even a little, there’s always a little hope that we can sit down together in the future.”
Mr. Smith’s peacemaking comments reflect how Microsoft intends to approach the next phase of its deal for Activision. Far from giving up on the acquisition, he said, the company intends to gamble that its “nice guy” strategy could still work.

In one plan, Microsoft hopes to win over regulators in Europe, people familiar with the approach said. European approval of the Activision deal could force U.S. officials to reach a settlement allowing for the acquisition to move forward or for a faster, more favorable court to hear the case, the people said.
Microsoft filed its response to the F.T.C. lawsuit on Thursday, arguing that the deal would expand access for gamers. “Giving consumers high-quality content in more ways and at lower prices is what the antitrust laws are supposed to promote, not prevent,” the filing said.
John Newman, the deputy director of the F.T.C.’s competition bureau, said in a Thursday night statement that it was “confident in our case and look forward to presenting it at trial.”
The F.T.C. has said the deal should be stopped because it would harm consumers. It said Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, could use Call of Duty and other popular Activision titles to lure gamers from rivals, especially Sony, which makes the PlayStation console.
Microsoft’s seemingly conciliatory approach is part of a nearly complete cultural transformation by the company since the 1990s, when it was known as the “Evil Empire” because of its strong-arm tactics to block out competitors. But under Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in 2014, and Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft’s top lawyer, the company has bent over backward in recent years to show it has grown up.

Pushing the Activision deal through has implications for more than just Microsoft. The F.T.C. lawsuit is a landmark in a new era of government scrutiny of the biggest tech companies. Ms. Khan has staked an aggressive trustbusting agenda on the case, which legal experts said might be difficult to win. If Microsoft cannot get the deal approved, other tech behemoths will be less likely to be able to force a megadeal through.
“They will fight it,” said Sid Parakh, a portfolio manager at Becker Capital, which invests in Microsoft. “It’s a bit more above and beyond this deal. It’s also a statement to the F.T.C.”
With Microsoft sitting on more than $100 billion to spend, he added, “they don’t want to back down now and then have every acquisition shot down.”
The acquisition of Activision must close by mid-July or Microsoft must pay as much as $3 billion in a breakup fee. Many hurdles remain, including approval from other global regulators, notably in Britain and in the European Union. If Microsoft can reach a formal settlement with them, it would leave the F.T.C. at a critical juncture.
The F.T.C. sued Microsoft in administrative court, which does not have the power to stop the deal from closing while the case is pending. If other regulators approved the deal, the F.T.C. would need to decide whether to file an injunction against the acquisition in federal court to stop it. The injunction process could move quickly, potentially handing Microsoft a swift legal victory.

“There is no sensible, legitimate reason for our transaction to be prevented from closing,” the chief executive of Activision, Bobby Kotick, said in a statement on Wednesday. “We believe we will prevail on the merits of the case.”
The F.T.C. declined to comment on Microsoft’s strategy or Mr. Smith’s conversation with Ms. Khan. Holly Vedova, the director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Competition, said the agency is always willing to consider proposals from companies looking to settle antitrust concerns.

Microsoft is trying to strike a balance between, on the one hand, seeming open to a settlement and, on the other, preparing to destroy the F.T.C.’s case in court. It has hired Beth Wilkinson, who prosecuted the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case before becoming one of America’s premier corporate litigators, to argue on its behalf before the F.T.C. in-house court.
Mr. Smith said he was optimistic that the case could avoid a messy trial, in part because of Microsoft’s previous experiences with antitrust enforcement.

In the 1990s, the company was known for its scorched-earth business tactics, bundling software products together to edge out competitors. In 1992, as regulators investigated the company, the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates dismissed the scrutiny, saying, “The worst that could come of this is that I could fall down on the steps of the F.T.C., hit my head and kill myself.”
Two years later, Microsoft agreed to a federal consent degree allowing personal computer makers more freedom to install programs from other companies. It staved off being broken up after a 1998 antitrust trial, and finally settled with the George W. Bush administration in 2001.
“The trial forced Microsoft to grow up, particularly in terms of its relationships with regulators and institutions beyond the tech industry,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who researches the history of tech companies.
In 2001, Mr. Smith walked into interviews to be Microsoft’s top lawyer with a message: It was time to make peace with regulators and competitors. He got the job. Over the next several years, he reached legal settlements over competition concerns with governments around the world and other industry players.
It was not always smooth sailing. Negotiations between the company and Sun Microsystems, a server company that made the popular Java programming language, fell apart and took a year to get back on track. In 2004, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive at the time, was on a plane to Brussels to announce a deal with the European Commission when Mr. Smith got news that the commission instead was going to sue Microsoft for unfair competition. It took five years to secure a deal.

Since Mr. Nadella took over, Microsoft has embraced an even more open stance. His first acquisition was the studio that makes Minecraft, a game in which children learn and socialize in an expansive virtual world. He also spent $7.5 billion to buy GitHub, a software platform that supports open-source code.
Microsoft is now the world’s second-most valuable public company, largely driven by its strong cloud computing offerings. The enterprise business at the heart of its growth generally attracts less government attention than social media or other consumer-facing ventures.
Globally, Mr. Smith has presented Microsoft as a friendly giant willing to work with skeptical lawmakers. He has proposed middle-ground rules on contentious issues like app stores and supported bipartisan interests like the expansion of broadband.
Mr. Smith maintains powerful relationships in Washington. A bundler for President Biden’s campaign, he attended a White House state dinner for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, just days before the F.T.C. sued to block the Activision deal.
After the deal was announced in January, Microsoft went to great lengths to soothe the fears of regulators. Mr. Smith and Mr. Nadella traveled to Washington in February to promote the deal’s benefits. The company also made peace with an agitating labor union, which in turn lobbied the F.T.C. on the deal. And it promised Sony that it would keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for years, and signed a deal to put the game on Nintendo’s Switch.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Smith said that “things moved quickly” in the final weeks before Microsoft was sued. When F.T.C. staff met with Microsoft’s team, it became clear that the agency had serious concerns, he said.
“Our team asked, ‘Could we discuss a settlement proposal?’ And the staff said, ‘Not with us,’” he said. Later discussions with the leadership of the agency’s antitrust bureau failed to bear fruit, he added.
On Dec. 6, Microsoft drafted a formal settlement proposal for the agency. Mr. Smith declined to say exactly what it contained but said it addressed “all the issues relating to Call of Duty,” referring to fears that Microsoft could pull the title from rival consoles. Mr. Smith spoke to each of the agency’s four commissioners, virtually, for an hour the next day.
A day after that, the F.T.C. commissioners voted 3 to 1 to sue.
But Mr. Smith said he refused to think of the situation as an us-versus-them situation.
“I will always start by asking myself, could I have done more?” he said. “What I do know is that January brings a new year.”

Re “Growing Network of Conservative Groups Is Fueling Book Bans” (front page, Dec. 13):
Do these parents really believe that the moral code they teach to their children is so fragile that the presence of a book on a library shelf will threaten it? Do they take no responsibility for talking with their children about the diversity of life and how their personal morals fit in?
A personal moral code is complex, and the most powerful influence is from the home. But even then no one can force anyone to believe something that does not fit their values or sense of self.
A book alone cannot force someone to behave in a manner that contradicts their morals. And banning books will not eliminate the ideas and voices of the people who wrote them. The ideas are out there in the conversations young people have every day.
The world is a diverse place. And eventually these “innocent children” will leave home and form their own moral code, sometimes despite what they may have been taught at home.

No one can protect their children from everything. And that is a good thing. Children need to be prepared to deal with a complicated world, and they can’t do that if they are shielded by fear and hate from ideas with which they disagree.

As a young boy growing up in Los Angeles in the 1950s, I was fascinated by the New York gangsters I read about in a book called “Murder, Inc.” But my father, who had grown up in Brooklyn in the 1920s and had gone to school with some of the most infamous characters in the book, was not amused.
He made me return the book to the library. He did not, however, demand that the library get rid of the book, nor did he launch a campaign to ban all books about organized crime.
A changing climate, a changing world
Card 1 of 4
Climate change around the world: In “Postcards From a World on Fire,” 193 stories from individual countries show how climate change is reshaping reality everywhere, from dying coral reefs in Fiji to disappearing oases in Morocco and far, far beyond.
The role of our leaders: Writing at the end of 2020, Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, found reasons for optimism in the Biden presidency, a feeling perhaps borne out by the passing of major climate legislation. That doesn’t mean there haven’t been criticisms. For example, Charles Harvey and Kurt House argue that subsidies for climate capture technology will ultimately be a waste.
The worst climate risks, mapped: In this feature, select a country, and we'll break down the climate hazards it faces. In the case of America, our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths.
What people can do: Justin Gillis and Hal Harvey describe the types of local activism that might be needed, while Saul Griffith points to how Australia shows the way on rooftop solar. Meanwhile, small changes at the office might be one good way to cut significant emissions, writes Carlos Gamarra.
My father was exercising his parental rights, trying to protect his children from material he considered inappropriate. Activist groups like Florida Citizens Alliance are more interested in imposing their personal beliefs on other people’s children.
Their next step may well be into the grown-up world, attempting to ban all books that do not align with their strict agenda. It wouldn’t be the first time in history.

I was born in a country where state worship is the national sport, uniting left and right, government and opposition.

What they apparently did not anticipate, I am now discovering, is the tyranny of the periphery. The government’s power to decree what books students should and should not read in my native Turkey is replaced here with local yahoos decreeing what students should and should not read.
Add to that local boards’ capricious decisions not to certify elections, local legislatures’ power to gerrymander electoral districts, and the authority recently given to private individuals to discriminate against others based on their loosely defined “religious beliefs,” and I am beginning to wonder if this great bastion of democracy is anything but that!

To the Editor:
I find it hard to take comments like “this is not about banning books, it’s about protecting the innocence of our children” seriously.
Our children learn shelter-in-place and active-shooter drills from kindergarten onward, and these same parents are not rallying around bans on assault rifles.
Allowing children to browse through the thousands of library books available and expand their minds does not destroy their innocence. Yet knowing that their school could be next, and that they could become the next victim, shatters not just innocence but lives as well.
These conservative groups are specifically targeting books by or about Black and L.G.B.T.Q. people. Calling it parental rights to shield their children is a poor excuse to hide their bigotry.

Representative Ro Khanna of California’s comments about Big Oil’s role in prolonging the climate crisis are timely and necessary. These companies should be held accountable. But Congress’s approach is allowing a vast number of companies that use huge amounts of energy to pass the buck.
ADVERTISEMENT

For the past 10 years, Big Oil has recognized the need for fundamental research and has provided significant funding to universities to develop radically new energy technologies. These efforts have often been criticized as greenwashing. But what have the other giants of American industry done? They have largely passed the buck, continue to do so and remain out of the line of sight of Congress.
When tech giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft make net-zero promises, who are they expecting to create the necessary technologies? Just buying some carbon credits won’t cut it.
We need investment in clean energy research from the demand-side companies generating significant emissions from fossil fuels. To address the climate crisis, we need everybody at the table and held accountable, not just Big Oil.

2022-12-29,"Each year, I look ahead at what’s new in technology to predict the tech that may affect your life in a big way — and the tech that will most likely be a fad.
Before we get into that, though, let’s take a quick look back at 2022.
Hardware was very “meh.” This year’s iPhone, with mostly unnoticeable improvements, was an even more incremental upgrade than last year’s model. Separately, Meta released a $1,500 virtual-reality headset that Mark Zuckerberg envisioned would change the way that people worked — though with two hours of battery life, most people will probably use it only to play games.
Social media became very weird. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, bought Twitter for $44 billion, gutted the staff and suspended the accounts of some journalists and techies, which sent droves of Twitter users to seek alternative sites.
And the fate of TikTok is in jeopardy, as more than a dozen states, citing national security concerns, have banned the app’s use on government-issued devices.

Microsoft’s $69 billion bid for the video game company Activision Blizzard was the year’s biggest deal.

Jae C. Hong/Associated Press
Heading into 2022, Wall Street’s deal-makers thought it would be hard to maintain last year’s record-breaking pace for mergers and acquisitions. Still, few thought their businesses would fall by too much.
But the M.&A. business hit turbulence in the middle of the year and hasn’t recovered.
Activity held up compared with historical trends, with about 53,863 deals worth $3.6 trillion announced in 2022, according to Refinitiv, but dropped sharply in the second half of the year. And while the yearly total pales in comparison with 2021’s $5.7 trillion worth of transactions, it’s in line with the value and number of takeovers announced in the previous six years.
“I would sum it up as significantly less activity than in 2021,” said Marco Caggiano, the head of North American M.&A. at JPMorgan Chase. “But because 2021 was historically at such a high level, 2022 looks like a more normalized level of volume.”
Perhaps the bigger question is how things look for next year. Bankers, lawyers and private equity executives suggest that, for all the challenges they faced this year, there are reasons to be optimistic about 2023.

Economic headwinds intensified
Deal-makers like to say that the mergers business is built on corporate confidence. At the start of 2022, the rising markets, strong corporate profits and cheap debt that powered last year’s surge in transactions appeared likely to stick around. Microsoft’s $69 billion bid for the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, the biggest takeover of 2022, was unveiled just a few weeks into the year. (That deal now faces challenges from the United States; more on that below.) Indeed, four of the five biggest deals this year, including Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter, were announced before May.
All that was before a potent combination of economic developments — volatile markets, rising inflation, climbing interest rates and geopolitical instability spurred by factors such as the war in Ukraine — shook company boards’ willingness to take risks.
Financing became more complicated
Rattled nerves didn’t only affect corporate directors and management teams. Banks that helped finance takeovers were increasingly unable to sell on the debt to other investors, leaving them with billions of dollars stuck on their books. (Lenders to Mr. Musk for his Twitter deal have had to hold on to about $12.5 billion worth of loans, hoping to avoid booking huge losses by selling them now.)
That jolt to a crucial part of deal-making unnerved would-be buyers and sellers. “We don’t need low interest rates for a robust M.&A. market, but we need a predictable, stable financing market,” said Stephan Feldgoise, a co-head of global M.&A. at Goldman Sachs.
David Sambur, a co-head of private equity at the investment giant Apollo Global Management, added that while many had anticipated more difficulties in obtaining financing this year, “the speed of it, I think, surprised a lot of people.”
Harder-to-get financing had a pronounced effect on private equity firms, which historically rely on cheap debt to power their transactions. About 11,405 deals backed by the sector, worth about $780.5 billion, were announced this year, down 24.6 percent by volume compared with 2021.
Uncertainty over financing, coupled with choppy markets and economic uncertainty, introduced another hurdle: valuation, as buyers and sellers disagreed over how much target companies were worth. In some instances, those disputes froze deal-making altogether. “For companies that are well funded, there’s no need or imperative to do anything,” Mr. Feldgoise said.

Government challenges grew louder

Not all obstacles arose from economic factors. Government regulators have taken a tougher line against big deals, particularly in the United States. Both Lina Khan of the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter at the Justice Department’s antitrust division have sought to widen the grounds on which they could challenge transactions — even if they lose some cases along the way.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
In some ways, that more interventionist approach catches up to the attitude of regulators in Britain and the European Union.
That shift in philosophy led the F.T.C. to sue to block Microsoft’s takeover of Activision, a deal that under prevailing antitrust standards probably wouldn’t be seen to substantially harm competition. But Ms. Khan has argued that approach ignores the effects of big mergers on issues like innovation, particularly as corporate titans become bigger.
Still, some deal-makers played down the risks that heightened antitrust scrutiny would have for boards and executives looking to do an acquisition, since most will still get done — it just might take longer.
“People will need to adjust their strategy,” said Antonio Bavasso, a partner and antitrust specialist at the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. “Are they willing to litigate to take their deals through?”

SPACs had a rough year
One part of the M.&A. market suffered an especially sharp decline: special purpose acquisition companies, known as SPACs or blank-check funds, which raise money in the public markets to buy privately held companies.
Just as quickly as SPACs surged in popularity in 2020 and 2021, so they fell out of favor this year: 170 such funds were raised, a 75 percent decline from last year, according to Refinitiv. Perhaps more important, the number of announced SPAC mergers fell 22 percent, to 226, while the number of canceled SPAC combinations more than doubled, to 55.
The reasons for the cooling off, experts say, include closer scrutiny of blank-check funds’ governance, as well as the relatively poor performance of companies that have gone public by merging with SPACs. Investors in these funds have also increasingly demanded to get their money back, reducing the overall amount of capital available to the companies that combine with SPACs.
“Redemptions and post-close trading performance are real headwinds to continued M.&A. volume in the sector,” said Mr. Caggiano of JPMorgan. “I think people look at that and say, ‘If I go down that route, the SPAC isn’t really going to bring much capital to the table.’”

What lies ahead?
Despite all those challenges, M.&A. advisers (who tend to be a largely optimistic lot) believe there’s reason to hope for a respectable 2023. Among them is the fact that many companies want to expand or shift their business strategies, and doing a deal is often the best or easiest way of doing so.
That doesn’t necessarily mean a uniform pace of deal-making. Mr. Caggiano expects 2023 to start off slowly before ratcheting up, in a reverse of 2022. But he and others believe that mergers activity should remain fairly robust.
“The strategic imperatives that came out of Covid — repositioning, scale, onshoring — none of those have changed,” said Mr. Feldgoise of Goldman. “Boards are saying, ‘I want to fortress my company.’”

And even the challenges that 2022 has presented shouldn’t be, well, deal breakers. Take higher financing costs: “The cost of money now is essentially normal. The world we were living in previously, that was abnormal,” said Mr. Sambur of Apollo. “It’s not like deals can’t work with financing costs where they are.”
Or consider antitrust enforcement. Mr. Bavasso of Simpson Thacher said regulators were unlikely to let up, particularly in the United States, as the likes of Ms. Khan continue trying to rewrite the rules of antitrust by challenging deals.
But Mr. Feldgoise predicted many companies would weigh the risks of antitrust action against a host of other considerations. “It’s been a factor in every administration, but it’s one of several factors as it always has been,” he said.
Ultimately, companies and private equity firms intent on doing deals are going to carry on hunting — and the turbulence of today’s landscape may even yield bargains. “In our experience, our best performing funds are funds that we deploy during recessions and market downturns,” said Matt Nord, Apollo’s other co-head of private equity. “The more stress there is in the system, the bigger the pipeline of opportunities there are for us.”

2022-12-31,"At 19, when I began drafting my webcomic, I had just been flung into adulthood. I felt a little awkward, a little displaced. The glittering veneer of social media, which back then was mostly Facebook, told me that everyone around me had their lives together while I felt like a withering ball of mediocrity. But surely, I believed, I could not be the only one who felt that life was mostly an uphill battle of difficult moments and missed social cues.
I started my webcomic back in 2011, before “relatable” humor was as ubiquitous online as it is today. At the time, the comics were overtly simple, often drawn shakily in Microsoft Paint or poorly scanned sketchbook pages. The jokes were less punchline-oriented and more of a question: Do you feel this way too? I wrote about the small daily struggles of missed clock alarms, ill-fitting clothes and cringe-worthy moments.
I had hoped, at most, for a small, niche following, but to my elation, I had viral success. My first comic to reach a sizable audience was about simply not wanting to get up in the morning, and it was met with a chorus of “this is so me.” I felt as if I had my finger on the pulse of the collective underdog. To have found this way of communicating with others and to make it my work was, and remains, among the greatest gifts and privileges of my life.
But the attention was not all positive. In late 2016, I caught the eye of someone on the 4chan board /pol/. There was no particular incident that prompted the harassment, but in hindsight, I was a typical target for such groups. I am a woman, the messaging in the comics is feminist leaning, and importantly, the simplicity of my work makes it easy to edit and mimic. People on the forum began reproducing my work and editing it to reflect violently racist messages advocating genocide and Holocaust denial, complete with swastikas and the introduction of people getting pushed into ovens. The images proliferated online, with sites like Twitter and Reddit rarely taking them down.

A recent example of my work
Image
For my comics, I keep things simple — punchy drawings, minimal text — because I like my ideas to be immediately accessible. I write a lot about day-to-day life. My pets, their personality quirks and my love for them are common themes.
The ways my images were altered were crude, but a few were convincing. Through the bombardment of my social media with these images, the alt-right created a shadow version of me, a version that advocated neo-Nazi ideology. At times people fell for it. I received outraged messages and had to contact my publisher to make my stance against this ultraclear. I started receiving late-night calls and had to change my number, and I got the distinct impression that the alt-right wanted a public meltdown.

At one point, someone appeared to have made a typeface, or a font, out of my handwriting. Something about the mimicking of my handwriting, streamlined into an easily accessible typeface, felt particularly violating. Handwriting is personal and intimate to me, a detail that defines me as much other unique traits like the color of my eyes or my name. I can easily recognize the handwriting of my family members and friends — it is literally their signature. Something about this new typeface made me feel as if the person who had created it was trying to program a piece of my soul.
One of the images created by the alt-right
Image
In this comic, only the text was edited. The drawings are mine (though they are a bit dated as my style has evolved since 2017). I found the typeface to be a convincing imitation of my handwriting. Had the text been fitted into the speech bubbles more elegantly, I’d find this almost indistinguishable from my work.
The harassment shocked the naïveté out of my system. A shadow me hung over my head constantly, years after the harassment campaign ended. I had been writing differently, always trying to stay one step ahead of how my drawings could be twisted. Every deranged image the alt-right created required someone sitting down and physically editing or drawing it, and this took time and effort, allowing me to outpace them and salvage my career.
And then along comes artificial intelligence. In October, I was sent via Twitter an image generated by A.I. from a random fan who had used my name as a prompt. It wasn’t perfect, but the contours of my style were there. The notion that someone could type my name into a generator and produce an image in my style immediately disturbed me. This was not a human creating fan art or even a malicious troll copying my style; this was a generator that could spit out several images in seconds. With some technical improvement, I could see how the process of imitating my work would soon become fast and streamlined, and the many dark potentials bubbled to the forefront of my mind.
I felt violated. The way I draw is the complex culmination of my education, the comics I devoured as a child and the many small choices that make up the sum of my life. The details are often more personal than people realize — the striped shirt my character wears, for instance, is a direct nod to the protagonist of “Calvin and Hobbes,” my favorite newspaper comic. Even when a person copies me, the many variations and nuances in things like line weight make exact reproductions difficult. Humans cannot help bringing their own humanity into art. Art is deeply personal, and A.I. had just erased the humanity from it by reducing my life’s work to an algorithm.
A.I. text-to-image generators such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DALL-E exploded onto the scene this year and in mere months have become widely used to create all sorts of images, ranging from digital art pieces to character designs. Stable Diffusion alone has more than 10 million daily users. These A.I. products are built on collections of images known as “data sets,” from which a detailed map of the data set’s contents, the “model,” is formed by finding the connections among images and between images and words. Images and text are linked in the data set, so the model learns how to associate words with images. It can then make a new image based on the words you type in.

when I used my name as a prompt

It’s not perfect — but it has captured the signature elements of my drawing style. The black bangs, striped shirt and wide eyes are immediately recognizable. As A.I. gets increasingly sophisticated, I am growing more concerned about what’s possible.
The data set for Stable Diffusion is called LAION 5b and was built by collecting close to six billion images from the internet in a practice called data scraping. Most, if not all, A.I. generators have my work in their data sets.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Legally, it appears as though LAION was able to scour what seems like the entire internet because it deems itself a nonprofit organization engaging in academic research. While it was funded at least in part by Stability AI, the company that created Stable Diffusion, it is technically a separate entity. Stability AI then used its nonprofit research arm to create A.I. generators first via Stable Diffusion and then commercialized in a new model called DreamStudio.
So what makes up these data sets? Well, pretty much everything. For artists, many of us had what amounted to our entire portfolios fed into the data set without our consent. This means that A.I. generators were built on the backs of our copyrighted work, and through a legal loophole, they were able to produce copies of varying levels of sophistication. When I checked the website haveibeentrained.com, a site created to allow people to search LAION data sets, so much of my work was on there that it filled up my entire desktop screen.
Many artists are not completely against the technology but felt blindsided by the lack of consideration for our craft. Being able to imitate a living artist has obvious implications for our careers, and some artists are already dealing with real challenges to their livelihood. Concept artists create works for films, video games, character designs and more. Greg Rutkowski, a hugely popular concept artist, has been used in a prompt for Stable Diffusion upward of 100,000 times. Now, his name is no longer attached to just his own work, but it also summons a slew of imitations of varying quality that he hasn’t approved. This could confuse clients, and it muddies the consistent and precise output he usually produces. When I saw what was happening to him, I thought of my battle with my shadow self. We were each fighting a version of ourself that looked similar but that was uncanny, twisted in a way to which we didn’t consent.
It gets darker. The LAION data sets have also been found to include photos of extreme violence, medical records and nonconsensual pornography. There’s a chance that somewhere in there lurks a photo of you. There are some guardrails for the more well-known A.I. generators, such as limiting certain search terms, but that doesn’t change the fact that the data set is still rife with disturbing material, and that users can find ways around the term limitations. Furthermore, because LAION is open source, people are creating new A.I. generators that don’t have these same guardrails and that are often used to make pornography.
In theory, everyone is at risk for their work or image to become a vulgarity with A.I., but I suspect those who will be the most hurt are those who are already facing the consequences of improving technology, namely members of marginalized groups. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, has an entire saga of deep-fake nonconsensual pornography attached to her image. I can only imagine that some of her more malicious detractors would be more than happy to use A.I. to harass her further. In the future, with A.I. technology, many more people will have a shadow self with whom they must reckon. Once the features that we consider personal and unique — our facial structure, our handwriting, the way we draw — can be programmed and contorted at the click of a mouse, the possibilities for violations are endless.

I’ve been playing around with several generators, and so far none have mimicked my style in a way that can directly threaten my career, a fact that will almost certainly change as A.I. continues to improve. It’s undeniable; the A.I.s know me. Most have captured the outlines and signatures of my comics — black hair, bangs, striped T-shirts. To others, it may look like a drawing taking shape.

2023-01-03,"Organized labor claimed one of its biggest victories at a U.S. tech company on Tuesday, gaining a foothold among about 300 employees at a video game maker owned by Microsoft.
The Communications Workers of America, which will represent the employees, announced the result, and Microsoft issued a statement recognizing the outcome.
“We look forward to engaging in good faith negotiations as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement,” the company said. Microsoft has no other unionized workers.
The unionization move at the video game maker, ZeniMax Media, which Microsoft acquired for about $7.5 billion in a deal that closed in 2021, did not involve a conventional union election run by the National Labor Relations Board.

Instead, the company allowed workers to express their preferences in two ways: They could sign a union authorization card, which some began doing in November, or they could vote anonymously through an online platform that was open during most of December.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
The process was more efficient and less contentious than the run-up to a typical labor board election, which can involve extensive legal wrangling.
Microsoft agreed to remain neutral throughout the union campaign, avoiding the anti-union meetings and messaging that many companies engage in. The concessions came as the company has been trying to placate antitrust regulators who are scrutinizing its roughly $70 billion proposed acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard.
“This is an empowering victory that allows us to protect ourselves and each other in a way we never could without a union,” Skylar Hinnant, a worker involved in the organizing campaign, said in a statement.

When workers at a vast Amazon warehouse on Staten Island pushed to organize last year, the company fought the effort aggressively. The union prevailed in April, but Amazon has challenged the results. Apple has also sought to persuade retail workers against unionizing, though workers at two stores have voted to do so.

ZeniMax employees involved in the campaign, which included only quality assurance, or Q.A., workers, said Microsoft’s neutral stance came as a relief. “It was nothing short of an absolute gift,” Autumn Mitchell, a worker active in the union effort, said during an interview last month.

In a further sign that unionization is gaining traction across the gaming industry, workers at a Boston studio owned by Activision announced last week that they had filed a petition to hold a union election.
Two other Activision studios have already voted to unionize — one in Wisconsin and the other near Albany, N.Y. But unlike those studios, the proposed union at the Boston studio, known as Proletariat, includes a variety of workers, such as animators, designers and engineers, not just Q.A. workers. A formal union with broader membership would appear to be a first at a major U.S. game maker.
The Communications Workers of America represents workers at the two Activision studios that have already unionized and would represent the Boston-based workers.

At ZeniMax, which includes the high-profile Bethesda Game Studios, maker of such hits as The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, workers said they hoped a union would improve their pay and hours. Q.A. testers and other workers in the industry have long complained that they must endure grueling stretches of work shortly before a title is released.
Microsoft has said it consults with employees to ensure they don’t take on too much work.
Those seeking to unionize at ZeniMax also said that they hoped to change the company’s approach to promoting workers and to assigning them more responsibility, which they said seemed arbitrary at times, and that they hoped to be able to negotiate more flexible policies on remote work.
In June, Microsoft announced a deal with the communications workers union in which it promised to stay neutral if any of Activision’s U.S. employees sought to unionize after Microsoft acquired the company. The video game maker has about 7,000 U.S. employees, most of whom are eligible to unionize.
Officially, the labor deal applied only to employees who joined Microsoft through the Activision purchase. But the tech giant indicated that it would be open to extending the terms of the labor deal to current employees as well.
The politically powerful communications workers union had voiced reservations about Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, but it said the neutrality agreement addressed its concerns, and the union’s president later met with the chair of the Federal Trade Commission to urge support for the deal.
But regulators have not been appeased. The agency filed suit to block the Activision transaction in December, just as ZeniMax workers were deciding whether to unionize."

Elon Musk faces a “reality check” as Tesla sinks
With its stock in free fall and competition mounting on all sides, Tesla appears to be losing its most bullish supporters on a daily basis.
Shares in the electric car maker sank 12 percent on Tuesday, shaving roughly $47 billion (or, the equivalent of Ford’s entire market valuation) off its market cap as investors worry about growth in the year ahead. Zooming out, the Elon Musk-led company has lost more than $850 billion in market value since its peak in November 2020.
Image
Wall Street is growing pessimistic. Analysts at Goldman Sachs and Cowen cut their price targets after Tesla disclosed on Monday that it had missed its 2022 year-end goal for new deliveries despite offering steep discounts on some models. Adam Jonas, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley who has long championed the company, is now forecasting a decline in earnings over the next year.

“2023 will definitely be a reality check, because electric car makers will have to swim more on their own,” Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst, told DealBook. “And Tesla will feel it.”
Tesla shareholders could face more disappointment this year. Schmidt sees four challenges for Tesla:
Soaring interest rates will make car loans pricier, potentially sapping consumer demand.
Consumer incentives are also evaporating in markets like Britain, Germany and Sweden. (The opposite is happening in the U.S. under the Inflation Reduction Act.)
Protectionist policies in countries like China and Japan will increasingly favor domestic players.
Consumers now have more choice in electric vehicles, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Volkswagen ID3. In Europe, the world’s second biggest E.V. market behind China, Tesla’s market share of new electric vehicles sold has fallen from 33 percent in 2019 to about 15 percent, Mr. Schmidt calculates.
Mr. Musk himself has blamed the Fed’s aggressive interest rate rises for the sinking share price. But Tesla investors including Ross Gerber, a co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki, think he is too distracted by the travails of running Twitter to focus on righting the ship at Tesla.
Following Tuesday’s stock price drop, a nostalgic Mr. Musk tweeted, “12 months ago, I was Person of the Year.” Mr. Gerber responded, “easy come, easy go …”
Do investors have reason for hope? Reuters reports that Tom Zhu, Tesla’s China chief, will now oversee U.S. plant operations and sales in North America and Europe. “That’s a huge admission from Musk he needs help,” Mr. Schmidt said.

Beijing vows to fight back over Covid restrictions on Chinese travelers. New testing requirements by several countries — including Australia, Canada and the United States — were political acts that merit retaliation, a government official said. It’s the latest sign that the coronavirus remains politically sensitive for Beijing, as the dismantling of its zero-Covid policies lead to a surge in new cases.
Apple’s market valuation falls below $2 trillion. Shares fell on Tuesday as investors worry about slowing sales of iPhones, AirPods and MacBooks. Apple was the last company to hold onto a $2 trillion market cap; Microsoft lost that status last year.
Microsoft workers form a union. Employees of ZeniMax, a video game studio that the tech giant bought last year, voted to organize. Unlike other tech companies, Microsoft — which is trying to get its $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard approved — stayed neutral throughout the organizing campaign and recognized the union.

Sam Bankman-Fried prepares for a legal battle
The FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to fraud charges related to the collapse of his crypto exchange. (His trial is set to begin on Oct. 2.) The back-and-forth on Tuesday between his lawyers and federal prosecutors in a Manhattan courtroom suggests that he is gearing up for a potentially titanic legal fight.
Here are the highlights from Tuesday’s hearing:
Prosecutors asked the presiding judge for a new bail condition that would block Mr. Bankman-Fried from transferring any funds from FTX or its trading affiliate, Alameda Research. (The judge authorized the request.)
Mr. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers requested that the names of two other co-signers for his bond, aside from his parents, remain sealed to protect their privacy. (This was also approved.)
Prosecutors also described what they said was a growing body of evidence, including documents provided by banks, employees, political campaigns, internet service providers and FTX’s new leaders.

A fight over frozen crypto assets
The fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire is still reverberating across the crypto sector as it confronts angry investors and new lawsuits, and executives turn on each other. Cameron Winklevoss, a co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini, has blamed Barry Silbert, the founder of Digital Currency Group, the crypto conglomerate, for his own customers’ troubles.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“This mess is entirely of your own making,” Mr. Winklevoss wrote in an open letter published on Twitter. He said that 340,000 customers were owed a total of about $900 million on Gemini Earn, a product that allowed customers to earn up to 8 percent interest on their digital coins by lending them to Genesis Global Capital, a DCG subsidiary. Genesis, which has about $175 million frozen on FTX, halted withdrawals in November following FTX’s collapse, ultimately leaving Earn users out of pocket.
Mr. Winklevoss accused Mr. Silbert of borrowing from Gemini customers. “You hide behind lawyers, investment bankers and process,” he wrote, and accused him of “bad faith stalling tactics.” Mr. Silbert fired back that Gemini had not responded to its latest resolution offer and denied claims about DCG’s finances.
Late last month, Earn investors filed a proposed class action in New York federal court, naming Gemini and its founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The lawyers behind the suit, Hee-Jean Kim and James Serritella, told DealBook that they regard the Winklevoss letter as an attempt to shift the blame for investor losses in Earn, which Gemini had marketed as risk-free and akin to a “crypto savings bank.”
Gemini faces one of crypto’s existential questions: When is a crypto product a security? The suit alleges that Gemini failed to register Earn with the S.E.C. and didn’t disclose material information to investors. (In previous cases, BlockFi, the bankrupt crypto lender, settled charges with the regulator last year after failing to register a similar product, and the agency blocked a proposed interest offering from the crypto exchange Coinbase in 2021.)
Gary Gensler, chair of the S.E.C., told DealBook in a recent interview that the products are all securities “whether you call it rewards, yield or staking,” and that the crypto industry is beset by conflicts of interest when “providing an earn, yield or staking service and an exchange function.”

The N.F.L.’s latest crisis
The N.F.L. is a financial juggernaut that generated $11 billion in revenue in 2021 and just signed a seven-year streaming deal with YouTube that could be worth $2.5 billion a year — an indication of professional football’s continued pull.
But the league is now facing one of its biggest crises in decades, writes The Times Ken Belson, as the Buffalo Bills defender Damar Hamlin remains in critical condition after he suffered cardiac arrest in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Questions persist over how the N.F.L. handled the incident. Joe Buck, the ESPN broadcaster, initially said the players had been told they would have about five minutes to get ready to resume the game (it was ultimately postponed and the N.F.L. denied that it had given any consideration to a restart). ESPN said it had been in constant communication with the N.F.L. during the broadcast and “we reported what we were told in the moment.”
Violence is increasingly the focus as football participation rates fall. The N.F.L., which has set an annual revenue goal of $25 billion by 2027, has spent millions trying to shift the narrative from the more violent aspects of the game amid a string of high-profile player injuries. The league recently opened an investigation into the handling of a concussion suffered by the Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa; Hamlin’s teammate, the Bills cornerback Dane Jackson, was immobilized after hurting his neck in a game.
The next big decision is whether to finish the Bengals-Bills game. Both teams are vying for a bye in the first round of the playoffs heading into the last weekend of the regular season. But it’s unclear whether the players are mentally prepared to play while Hamlin remains hospitalized, or if the public will want a time out, too.

2023-01-05,"In a far-reaching move that could raise wages and increase competition among businesses, the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday unveiled a rule that would block companies from limiting their employees’ ability to work for a rival.
The proposed rule would ban provisions of labor contracts known as noncompete agreements, which prevent workers from leaving for a competitor or starting a competing business for months or years after their employment, often within a certain geographic area. The agreements have applied to workers as varied as sandwich makers, hairstylists, doctors and software engineers.
Studies show that noncompetes, which appear to directly affect roughly 20 percent to 45 percent of U.S. workers in the private sector, hold down pay because job switching is one of the more reliable ways of securing a raise. Many economists believe they help explain why pay for middle-income workers has stagnated in recent decades.
Other studies show that noncompetes protect established companies from start-ups, reducing competition within industries. The arrangements may also harm productivity by making it hard for companies to hire workers who best fit their needs.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The F.T.C. proposal is the latest in a series of aggressive and sometimes unorthodox moves to rein in the power of large companies under the agency’s chair, Lina Khan.
President Biden hailed the proposal on Thursday, saying that noncompete clauses “are designed simply to lower people’s wages.”
“These agreements block millions of retail workers, construction workers and other working folks from taking a better job, getting better pay and benefits, in the same field,” he said at a cabinet meeting.
The public will be allowed to submit comments on the proposal for 60 days, at which point the agency will move to make it final. An F.T.C. document said the rule would take effect 180 days after the final version was published, but experts said it could face legal challenges.
The agency estimated that the rule could increase wages by nearly $300 billion a year across the economy. Evan Starr, an economist at the University of Maryland who has studied noncompetes, said that was a plausible wage increase after their elimination.

Dr. Starr said noncompetes appeared to lower wages both for workers directly covered by them and for other workers, partly by making the hiring process more costly for employers, who must spend time figuring out whom they can hire and whom they can’t.
He pointed to research showing that wages tended to be higher in states that restrict noncompetes. One study found that wages for newly hired tech workers in Hawaii increased by about 4 percent after the state banned noncompetes for those workers. In Oregon, where new noncompetes became unenforceable for low-wage workers in 2008, the change appeared to raise the wages of hourly workers by 2 percent to 3 percent.
Although noncompetes appear to be more common among more highly paid and more educated workers, many companies have used them for low-wage hourly workers and even interns.
About half of states significantly constrain the use of noncompetes, and a small number have deemed them largely unenforceable, including California.
But even in such states, companies often include noncompetes in employment contracts, and many workers in these states report turning down job offers partly as a result of the provisions, suggesting that these state regulations may have limited effects. Many workers in those states are not necessarily aware that the provisions are unenforceable, experts say.

“Research shows that employers’ use of noncompetes to restrict workers’ mobility significantly suppresses workers’ wages — even for those not subject to noncompetes, or subject to noncompetes that are unenforceable under state law,” Elizabeth Wilkins, the director of the F.T.C.’s office of policy planning, said in a statement.
The commission’s proposal appears to address this issue by requiring employers to withdraw existing noncompetes and to inform workers that they no longer apply. The proposal would also make it illegal for an employer to enter into a noncompete with a worker or to try to do so, or to suggest that a worker is bound by a noncompete when he or she is not.
The proposal covers not just employees but also independent contractors, interns, volunteers and other workers.

Defenders of noncompetes argue that employees are free to turn down a job if they want to preserve their ability to join another company, or that they can bargain for higher pay in return for accepting the restriction. Proponents also argue that noncompetes make employers more likely to invest in training and to share sensitive information with workers, which they might withhold if they feared that a worker might quickly leave.

A ban “ignores the fact that, when appropriately used, noncompete agreements are an important tool in fostering innovation,” Sean Heather, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
At least one study has found that greater enforcement of noncompetes leads to an increase in job creation by start-ups, though some of its conclusions are at odds with other research.
Dr. Starr said that noncompetes did appear to encourage businesses to invest more in training, but that there was little evidence that most employees entered into them voluntarily or that they were able to bargain over them. One study found that only 10 percent of workers sought to bargain for concessions in return for signing a noncompete. About one-third became aware of the noncompete only after accepting a job offer.
Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said that while there were good reasons to scale back noncompetes for lower-wage workers, the rationale was less clear for better-paid workers with specialized knowledge or skills.
“If your job is to make minor tweaks to the formula for Coca-Cola and you’re one of 25 people on earth who knows the formula,” Dr. Strain said, speaking hypothetically, “it makes total sense that Coca-Cola might say, ‘We don’t want you to go work for Pepsi.’”

He said that it might be possible to satisfy an employer’s concerns with a less blunt tool, like a nondisclosure agreement, but that the evidence for this was lacking.
In a video call with reporters on Wednesday, Ms. Khan said she believed the F.T.C. had clear authority to issue the rule, noting that federal law empowers the agency to prohibit “unfair methods of competition.”
But Kristen Limarzi, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who previously served as a senior official in the antitrust division of the Justice Department, said she believed such a rule could be vulnerable to a legal challenge. Opponents would probably argue that the relevant federal statute is too vague to guide the agency in putting forth a rule banning noncompetes, she said, and that the evidence the agency has on their effects is still too limited to support a rule.
At the helm of the F.T.C. since last year, Ms. Khan has tried to use the agency’s authority in untested ways to rein in the power and influence of corporate giants. In doing so, she and her allies hope to reverse a turn in recent decades toward more conservative antitrust law — a shift that they say enabled runaway concentration, limited options for consumers and squeezed small businesses.
Ms. Khan has brought lawsuits in recent months to block Meta, Facebook’s parent company, from buying a virtual reality start-up and Microsoft from buying the video game publisher Activision Blizzard. Both cases employ less common legal arguments that are likely to face heavy scrutiny from courts. But Ms. Khan has indicated she is willing to lose cases if the agency ends up taking more risks.

Ms. Khan and her counterpart at the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Jonathan Kanter, have also said they want to increase the focus of the nation’s antitrust agencies on empowering workers. Last year, the Justice Department successfully blocked Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster using the argument that the deal would lower compensation for authors.
One question looming over the discussion of noncompetes is what effect banning them may have on prices during a period of high inflation, given that limiting noncompetes tends to raise wages.
But the experience of the past two years, when rates of quitting and job-hopping have been unusually high, suggests that noncompetes may not currently be as big an obstacle to worker mobility as they have traditionally been. Partly as a result, banning them may not have much of a short-term effect on wages.
Instead, some economists say, the more pronounced effect of a ban may come in the intermediate and long term, once the job market softens and workers no longer have as much leverage. At that point, noncompetes could begin to weigh more heavily on job switching and wages again.
“Doing something like this is a way to help sustain the increase in worker power over the last couple of years,” said Heidi Shierholz, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, who was chief economist at the Labor Department during the Obama administration.

Bed Bath & Beyond is suffering from a huge debt load.

John Taggart for The New York Times
Bed Bath & Beyond’s time is running out
In 2021, Bed Bath & Beyond joined the list of meme stocks whose share prices surged amid sudden interest from online retail investors. But the home furnishings retailer’s future is uncertain after a disappointing holiday sales season failed to help solve its worsening financial woes.
Bed Bath & Beyond is now weighing a variety of options, including raising cash by selling parts of its business or all of the company. But if those efforts fail, its only option may be to file for bankruptcy.
The retailer’s holiday season was exceedingly grim. Bed Bath & Beyond forecast a potential $386 million loss for its latest quarter, down 40 percent from the same time in 2021. The company also had a negative cash flow of $340 million last year and paid $65 million in interest. As of March, it had about $3 billion in debt. While the retailer is working on an ambitious turnaround plan, that requires time and money it may not have.
Raising money is getting harder for troubled companies. Thanks to rising interest rates, new loans are much more expensive, while institutional investors who were happy to buy the debt of riskier businesses during boom times are now picking only safe bets. Meanwhile, volatile stock markets have made issuing new equity difficult for many companies, an especially big problem for meme-stock companies that relied heavily on issuing new shares to finance their growth.

All of this is bad news for Bed Bath & Beyond:
The retailer took out a $375 million loan from Sixth Street in August, and it’s unclear whether the investment firm is interested in lending more.
The company had also tried to exchange some of its bonds for new equity, but that offer expired on Wednesday. That the retailer still has a huge debt load suggests that its creditors favor owning the company’s bonds to have a higher priority in a Chapter 11 case than if they had swapped their holdings for equity.
Bed Bath & Beyond isn’t the only meme-stock name in trouble. The movie theater chain AMC has seen its shares tumble 85 percent over the past year, while the video game retailer GameStop has fallen 50 percent.
The companies all face similar problems, according to David Trainer, the C.E.O. of the investment research firm New Constructs: “They don’t have enough pretax profit to pay their interest payments,” he told DealBook, adding that they have negative cash flow and no more than 24 months of cash-flow runway.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Representative Kevin McCarthy redoubles his efforts to win over right-wing holdouts. As the Republican leader lost an 11th ballot for speaker yesterday, he negotiated with dissidents on a potential deal that could drastically weaken his authority if he’s eventually elected. There may be movement toward an agreement, but it’s unclear whether or when one can be reached.
U.S. jobs data may show slowing growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the December employment data at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that roughly 200,000 jobs were added last month, keeping the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent. Investors and the Fed will be watching average hourly earnings growth, an inflationary indicator.

Tesla cuts prices in China for a second time in less than three months. The move came after the carmaker reported a sharp fall in sales in its second-biggest market last month, behind only the United States, as it faces tougher competition from Chinese rivals like BYD. Tesla also lowered some prices in Australia, Japan and South Korea.
Samsung profits fall to an eight-year low. The electronics giant said its operating profit fell 69 percent in its most recent quarter, battered by curbed demand for semiconductors and other tech goods like smartphones and TVs. Samsung also suffered from a glut in the computer chip market, particularly memory chips, which analysts say will probably persist.
The N.F.L. cancels the game postponed after Damar Hamlin collapsed.

The F.T.C.’s new war on noncompetes
Since becoming chair of the F.T.C., Lina Khan has embarked on a series of aggressive moves to expand federal competition oversight, including by suing to block prominent mergers.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But Ms. Khan is taking on one of her most ambitious challenges yet: calling for an end to noncompete agreements that limit workers’ ability to join rival companies or start a competitive businesses. The effort could lift workers’ wages, Ms. Khan argues, but opponents say that the agency is overreaching.
The use of noncompetes has swelled over the years. Often regarded as more commonly applying to highly paid workers like software engineers, the contract provisions appear to affect up to 45 percent of private sector workers, including sandwich makers, hairstylists and interns.
The F.T.C. and supporters of its effort say such clauses limit workers’ pay because they prevent people from switching jobs and make hiring more costly for employers who have to figure out whom they can and can’t hire. Banning them, the agency contends, could lift wages by nearly $300 billion a year; some academic research shows that wages have risen in states that have limited their use.
But defenders of noncompetes argue that they make employers more likely to invest in worker training and share sensitive information. They also contend that workers could turn down jobs that require noncompetes or ask for higher pay in return.
Expect a battle over the F.T.C.’s jurisdiction. Ms. Khan — who isn’t afraid of picking fights she may lose if they lead to expansions of regulatory power — told reporters that federal law empowers the agency to prohibit unfair methods of competition. (At least one Republican commissioner at the F.T.C., however, appears to favor a narrower approach.)

Corporate trade groups argue that the legal grounds for such a rule are questionable. “Congress has never delegated the F.T.C. anything close to the authority it would need to promulgate such a competition rule,” a top official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said yesterday. Legal experts expect lawsuits to challenge any final rule that’s approved.
A widening crisis in crypto
The fallout from the collapse of FTX is expanding as a growing number of crypto businesses face regulatory scrutiny or report that they’re struggling financially. Here’s a roundup of the latest news:
Silvergate’s shares plunged after a run on the bank. The crypto-focused bank’s stock fell nearly 43 percent yesterday after disclosing $8.1 billion in deposit withdrawals last quarter, forcing it to sell assets at a loss. It also wrote down $196 million spent buying technology from Diem Group, the blockchain payments project created by Facebook, and halted plans to release its own digital currency.
A founder of Celsius is accused of defrauding investors. New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, sued Alex Mashinsky, the failed crypto lender’s former C.E.O., accusing him of trying to defraud hundreds of thousands of investors by falsely claiming that his company’s platform was as safe as a traditional bank. Celsius filed for bankruptcy over the summer, leaving its customers with billions of dollars in lost deposits; the company said Mr. Mashinsky is no longer involved in its management.
Genesis laid off about a third of its workers and is contemplating bankruptcy. The embattled brokerage took steep losses from loans it made to Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research and the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Meanwhile, its parent company, Digital Currency Group, is trying to raise capital to pay back creditors, and its founder, Barry Silbert, is also feuding publicly with the crypto exchange Gemini.

The layoff contagion
Tech giants are cutting their workforces, and Wall Street banks are preparing to lay off thousands in the coming weeks. The companies blame overhiring during the pandemic, economic headwinds and the end of a deal-making and fund-raising boom.
Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, has another theory: copycat behavior. “Why would you expect, in a world in which we know from a ton of research for a variety of behaviors that that behavior is imitated, that this is the one behavior that would not be imitated and socially influenced?” he told DealBook.
Layoffs are expensive, Pfeffer said. Decades of research also show that layoffs aren’t always effective. But Mr. Pfeffer says companies imitate what their peers are doing rather than making evidence-based decisions. This is happening in the tech sector, he adds, where companies are insisting they need to cut costs despite having a lot of money.
If companies cut staff — say, because of a dip in deal flow or advertising revenue — they’ll most likely have to make hefty severance payments. But they will also eventually have to hire again, spending on recruiting fees, hiring bonuses and onboarding costs. And they often employ laid-off workers as contractors as well.

When companies in a sector carry out layoffs and then go on hiring sprees in sync, recruitment becomes more competitive, too. “It’s like buying high and selling low, which never struck me as a smart thing to do,” Mr. Pfeffer said.
And downsizing doesn’t necessarily bolster the bottom line. A 2015 analysis of 55 studies on how layoffs affect financial performance found that “downsizing often does not yield anticipated beneﬁts and that there is limited consensus among researchers on whether employee downsizing creates value.”

2023-01-10,"On a recent afternoon Jonas Thiel, a socioeconomics major at a college in northern Germany, spent more than an hour chatting online with some of the left-wing political philosophers he had been studying. These were not the actual philosophers but virtual recreations, brought to conversation, if not quite life, by sophisticated chatbots on a website called Character.AI.
Mr. Thiel’s favorite was a bot that imitated Karl Kautsky, a Czech-Austrian socialist who died before World War Two. When Mr. Thiel asked Kautsky’s digital avatar to provide some advice for modern-day socialists struggling to rebuild the worker’s movement in Germany, Kautsky-bot suggested that they launch a newspaper. “They can use it not only as a means of spreading socialist propaganda, which is in short supply in Germany for the time being, but also to organize working class people,” the bot said.
Kautsky-bot went on to argue that the working classes would eventually “come to their senses” and embrace a modern-day Marxist revolution. “The proletariat is at a low point in their history right now,” it wrote. “They will eventually realize the flaws in capitalism, especially because of climate change.”
Over the course of several days, Mr. Thiel met with other virtual scholars, including G.A. Cohen and Adolph Reed Jr. But he could have picked almost anyone, live or dead, real or imagined. At Character.AI, which emerged this summer, users can chat with reasonable facsimiles of everyone from Queen Elizabeth or William Shakespeare to Billie Eilish or Elon Musk (there are several versions). Anyone you want to invoke, or concoct, is available for conversation. The company and site, founded by Daniel De Freitas and Noam Shazeer, two former Google researchers, is among the many efforts to build a new kind of chatbot. These bots cannot chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to.
In late November, OpenAI, a San Francisco artificial intelligence lab, unveiled a bot called ChatGPT that left more than a million people feeling as if they were chatting with another human being. Similar technologies are under development at Google, Meta and other tech giants. Some companies have been reluctant to share the technology with the wider public. Because these bots learn their skills from data posted to the internet by real people, they often generate untruths, hate speech and language that is biased against women and people of color. If misused, they could become a more efficient way of running the kind of misinformation campaign that has become commonplace in recent years.
“Without any additional guardrails in place, they are just going to end up reflecting all the biases and toxic information that is already on the web,” said Margaret Mitchell, a former A.I. researcher at Microsoft and Google, where she helped start its Ethical A.I. team. She is now with the A.I. start-up Hugging Face.

2023-01-12,"The analysts who forecast the fortunes of corporate America have rarely been more pessimistic at the start of a year than they are in 2023.
The country’s largest companies are about to start publicly reporting their quarterly financial results, when analysts will pepper company management with questions about profits and losses and try to glean hints about what to expect in the months ahead. Coming after the S&P 500-stock index fell nearly 20 percent last year, these reports could help buoy the market if things aren’t as bad as they seem, or drag it down further.
On Friday, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and others will set the tone, providing a window on the state of the economy, consumer confidence and business activity in their financial releases.
Wall Street’s prognosticators predict that companies in the S&P 500 are about to reveal an aggregate fall in profit of about 4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, versus the same period a year ago, according to FactSet, the first decline since the early days of the pandemic. They also expect earnings to continue falling in the first half before rebounding to finish up 4 percent for the full year, according to data collected by Goldman Sachs going back to 1986.

That may not sound so bad, yet it stands out as the lowest forecast in recent history. That’s worse than was expected at the beginning of 2009, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and worse than at the start of 2002, as the dot-com bubble was rapidly deflating.
Analysts are balancing soaring inflation and interest rates against a resilient economy and some signs that inflation has peaked. They also tend to be a preternaturally optimistic bunch, so their not-so-great expectations are still cause for alarm for those who parse earnings forecasts, price targets and other ephemera produced by market watchers on Wall Street.
“It tells you expectations are already low,” said Ben Snider, an equity analyst at Goldman Sachs. “I don’t want to paint a picture that analysts are overly pessimistic. I think the estimates are reflecting what is a mediocre growth environment.”
For months, investors have been waiting for the bottom to fall out for corporate America. The rising costs of everything from energy to raw materials and labor stoked fears that profitability would plummet. However, many companies have been able to pass on higher costs to consumers without denting their sales, propping up profit margins and generating cash to spend on operations or dividends and share buybacks, which directly benefit investors.
That may be about to change.
Amazon is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings that are almost 50 percent less than the year before. Expectations for profits at Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, which have an outsize impact on stock indexes because of their size, have also dropped, according to the FactSet. Big technology firms have laid off tens of thousands of workers in recent weeks.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
However, all that information is immediately reflected in stock prices, or so the theory goes. That’s why investors and analysts pay such close attention to comments by corporate executives about how they see the future panning out, even if earnings calls are ostensibly held to talk about the past.
On these calls, analysts mix praise of management with pointed questions about the feasibility of their strategies. The discussion this quarter will probably focus on the effects of high inflation and interest rates, the likelihood of recession, and layoffs. Investors will also been listening for signals about the effect of China’s reopening as well as the impact of new taxes on corporate income.
And investors are wise to the common practice of executives talking down their companies’ prospects, giving themselves wiggle room for underperformance or simply a lower bar to beat and boost to their company’s stock price.
“Recent client conversations indicate some skeptical investors are wary that managements might low-ball” their latest results and the outlook for 2023, Goldman’s analysts wrote in a recent research note.
Yet there is also reason to be genuinely cautious.
Inflation remains stubbornly high, so the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising interest rates, tightening the screws on the economy. Central bank officials have been adamant that the economy needs to soften in order to bring down inflation, and that implies more layoffs and weaker consumer demand, which makes it harder for companies to raise prices.

This week, the Walt Disney Company announced changes to its pricing policy at theme parks, an acknowledgment that it may have pushed too hard in pursuit of profit, while FedEx said it would further pare back some weekend delivery services as demand waned for its services.
“Big picture, we care about what is happening with demand and what is happening to companies’ costs,” said Ron Temple, the chief market strategist at Lazard.
Goldman’s analysts don’t expect earnings of companies in the S&P 500 to grow at all this year, a more downbeat forecast than the average. The bank itself laid off up to 3,200 people this week.
The biggest risk for companies and the stock market remains the Fed’s campaign to constrain the economy and lower inflation, potentially pushing the economy into recession. Goldman’s analysts see a potential earnings decline of more than 10 percent this year in that scenario.
“What worries me is that there is this sense that we may still come through this period with very little going wrong,” Mr. Temple said. “There is too much complacency.”"

Global crises are weighing on the World Economic Forum.

Hand-wringing in Davos
Andrew here. I’m attending the World Economic Forum with DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and a team from The Times to capture the mood and behind-the-scenes action among the world leaders and the C.E.O.s who’ve made their annual pilgrimage to the Swiss Alps.
Speaking of which: Davos is normally full of hand-wringing over the state of the world, but it feels especially pronounced this year. (That isn’t necessarily reflected in the crowd of corporate pop-ups on the Promenade, one of the town’s main thoroughfares, nor in the cocktail party schedule.)
The word of the event is “polycrisis,” a term we’ve been hearing in countless meetings and gatherings. The word — apparently coined in the 1990s, then used in 2016 by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission’s president at the time — now refers to the swirl of global emergencies that include economic slowdowns and rising inflation, the war in Ukraine and more.
The World Economic Forum itself has embraced the term in its annual report, citing the challenges that globalization, the beating heart of the conference, was meant to solve. Among them is climate change, a topic whose relevance is perhaps best reinforced by the barely snow-touched streets of Davos itself. Executives here told DealBook that they were frustrated with a lack of progress on issues like a global framework to tackle things like climate-risk disclosures.

Is Davos becoming more and more of a giant business conference despite its high-minded mission statement? This year, many of the world’s most influential heads of state aren’t here: The only Group of 7 leader present is Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany. The highest-ranking Biden administration official set to attend is Marty Walsh, the labor secretary, though lawmakers like Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are present.
But C.E.O.s are well-represented, including Amazon’s Andy Jassy, JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Pfizer’s Albert Bourla and countless others. Many aren’t participating in public panels, either; they’re holding private meetings with existing and prospective clients at hotels scattered across town. One C.E.O. said he was in back-to-back 30-minute meetings every day from 7:30 a.m. through 7 p.m., before heading to countless dinners.
Criticism of Davos is high this year. Bill Browder, the financier and anti-Putin activist, has drawn outsize attention after Semafor reported that the World Economic Forum had asked him to pay $250,000 to attend after charging him $70,000 in previous years. (He’s still attending private events to raise attention for his anti-Russian advocacy.)
Meanwhile, the comedian Russell Brand is seemingly devoting his talk show to criticizing the conference and how it’s tackling global problems. Greenpeace mocked Davos’s environmental aims by noting the enormous flock of private jets taken to the gathering. And the hedge fund mogul Dan Loeb, a onetime fixture of the Davos scene who stopped coming a few years ago, joked in a reply to Mr. Browder, “I remember when going to #Davos was prestigious and elite. I’m sure it’s still fun however.”

Alibaba draws a meme stock activist. Ryan Cohen, whose investments in GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond helped stoke rallies in their shares, amassed a stake in the Chinese e-commerce group last year, The Wall Street Journal reports. Mr. Cohen has been pushing Alibaba for bigger stock buybacks; more broadly, he appears to be interested in investing in Chinese companies.

The E.U. reportedly plans to warn Microsoft about its Activision Blizzard deal. The European Commission will soon present the tech giant with its objections to the $69 billion takeover, according to Reuters. While it’s unclear whether the antitrust watchdog will move to block the transaction, this is the latest sign of the growing regulatory pushback for Microsoft.
China builds a lead in A.I. research. Chinese researchers in 2021 published roughly twice as many academic papers on the topic as their American counterparts did, and were also cited more frequently by other researchers, according to a study by Nikkei and the scientific publisher Elsevier. That underlines the growing tensions between the two countries over what they view as a vital technology.
Wyoming lawmakers propose a ban on electric cars. A group of state legislators are seeking to end sales of new electric vehicles there by 2035 in an effort to protect Wyoming’s oil and gas industries. The bill is the inverse of efforts by other states to eventually ban gas-powered cars, and comes as electric vehicle sales are becoming a bigger part of overall global car sales.

China’s double dose of bad news
China disclosed today that its population shrank last year — in what experts warn may herald an irreversible decline — while its economy just delivered one of its worst performances in decades.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The developments show that China, for decades the engine of global growth, is now entering a demographic crisis as some of the key drivers of its economy are under threat.
More people died in China last year than were born for the first time since Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward, an experiment that caused widespread famine and death, despite efforts to bolster the birthrate. Meanwhile, the country’s economy grew 3 percent last year — well short of Beijing’s 5.5 percent target — as lockdowns under a “zero Covid” policy hit manufacturing and consumer spending.
The end of “zero Covid” is stoking hopes for a global rebound. China’s economy performed better than analysts had expected in the fourth quarter — though many economists think official data was exaggerated — and is forecast to bounce back this year. Chinese consumers, free to travel again, are set to resume spending at home and abroad. As the world’s biggest consumer of commodities, China’s reopening will most likely bolster the businesses of metals and energy exporters. And as it is the world’s largest exporter of manufactured goods, global supply chain disruptions are expected to ease.
But bigger problems hang over any recovery. The declining population aggravates China’s long-term structural challenges, including the costs of managing an aging population while not producing enough new workers; Beijing’s growing scrutiny of private enterprise; a crisis in the property sector, a longtime pillar of growth; and rising pressure from the U.S. and the West on matters like semiconductors and A.I.

Is Beijing doing enough? Michael Pettis, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that Beijing faces unbalanced economic growth: Wealthier eastern provinces are thriving, but larger, more rural areas are being hit by economic decline and rising emigration. “For me the really big question marks concern the political implications of the ‘two’ diverging Chinas, and how Beijing decides to resolve them,” he tweeted.
Musk’s latest legal fight is set to begin
Elon Musk has his hands full these days, including with running Twitter after taking the company private last fall and with Tesla having to discount prices to fend off rivals. But starting today in a San Francisco federal courtroom, he will be occupied with something else: a trial over his 2018 plan to take Tesla private.
The legal battle, brought by disaffected Tesla shareholders, is the latest involving a tweet in which Mr. Musk said he was weighing a buyout of the company with “funding secured.” He ultimately didn’t go through with a deal, but that tweet led to a lengthy battle with the S.E.C. Now, if he loses, he could be forced to pony up billions of dollars in damages.
Mr. Musk has long argued that he did nothing wrong. The Tesla C.E.O. has consistently said he believed that he had the backing of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund when he posted his now-infamous tweet. (The fund’s chief told Mr. Musk that it hadn’t committed to such a deal, according to texts that emerged in court filings.) The S.E.C. and the litigious Tesla investors said that was a reckless and untrue tweet, something this trial’s judge has already said he agreed with in another case.

This trial revolves around the question of whether investors lost money trading Tesla shares as a result of statements by Mr. Musk that courts found false. Legal experts say that could be tricky. As of Friday’s close, Tesla shares are up more than sixfold since Mr. Musk’s August 2018 “funding secured” tweet, but it’s worth remembering that shortly after the post, Tesla shares whipsawed for several weeks, falling by more than 10 percent at one point.
Mr. Musk’s prospects of victory may have been undermined by Twitter. News reports describing his leadership of the social network as erratic — and the ill will that has stirred up among sectors of the public — have “saturated” the Bay Area, his lawyers argued in court. That made it hard to find an unbiased jury for the trial, they argued, though the presiding judge rejected their request to move proceedings to Texas.
Expect a cavalcade of prominent witnesses. Among those set to testify are Larry Ellison of Oracle, a former Tesla board member, and James Murdoch, a current one.

Oliver Stone’s latest film played to a packed audience in Davos.

A film provocateur meets the global elite
Amid the crowd gathered at the World Economic Forum, Oliver Stone — an unexpected attendee — easily stands out. The filmmaker behind “Wall Street” and “Platoon” has a history of jabbing the political, business and social elite with projects that advance controversial ideas: Think about his films focused on Vladimir Putin, Edward Snowden, John F. Kennedy and more.
Mr. Stone came to Davos with another provocative movie, which advocates for an issue long whispered about here but rarely said aloud: nuclear power as a force for good. In “Nuclear Now!,” which premiered at the Venice Film Festival, he argues that nuclear has been unfairly maligned by oil companies and others to make the public fearful about its safety.
For Mr. Stone, nuclear is the only existing technology that could help meaningfully bring down carbon emissions from energy, and its danger has been drastically overstated, even in light of disasters like the failure of the Fukushima power plant in 2011.
The Davos crowd appeared eager to listen. The theater screening “Nuclear Now!” here was packed — to the point of attendees sitting on the floor. The film was financed in part by two Davos veterans: Roksana Ciurysek-Gedir, a financier, and Zachary Bogue, a venture capitalist and the husband of the former Yahoo C.E.O. Marissa Mayer.

The appetite for the film may be because of people’s eagerness to find realistic solutions for climate change, according to Mr. Stone. “Despite our investments in renewables, it’s not improving our carbon emissions because we haven’t tackled the core issue — eliminating fossil fuels,” he told DealBook. “Climate change has forced us to take a new look at nuclear power.”
Seen and heard at Davos: India’s power minister, Raj Kumar Singh, defended his country’s imports of Russian oil and gas during a panel on the food and energy crises, moderated by The Times’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. And executives are debating the short-term impacts of China’s reopening, including whether a burst in spending could exacerbate inflation, or if supply chain easing will be enough to offset that, DealBook hears. Meanwhile, “green hushing” has been a hot topic, with one P.R. adviser telling DealBook he’s recommending that companies stay out of politics and not talk about climate initiatives.

Why a crypto rebound is a big deal
Crypto bulls are extending one of the most unlikely rallies of the year so far, pushing Bitcoin above $21,000 for a second day. That means the digital currency has now recouped all its losses since the collapse of FTX in November.

The rising tide has lifted most crypto boats. Even some beaten-down tokens — including FTX’s in-house token, FTT — have rebounded as investors bet the Fed will slow its pace of interest rate increases, leading to a broad rally of risky assets. Shares in Coinbase, the publicly traded crypto exchange, have also jumped over the past week.
But crypto analysts are divided on whether the rally is sustainable. Skeptics argue that the fundamentals for a long-term rise are missing, making the recent jump a risky bet for investors.
Meanwhile there’s some good news for FTX creditors. Lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm advising on the bankruptcy of the fallen crypto exchange, disclosed on Tuesday that the company’s assets were worth roughly $5.5 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash and $3.5 billion in crypto assets. That makes this wider crypto rally significant for FTX creditors — if it lasts.

The revelation could be a cornerstone of prosecutors’ fraud case against Bankman-Fried, who will stand trial in October.

Japan sticks to its outlier approach
The Bank of Japan maintained its policy of aggressively buying up sovereign bonds and keeping interest rates in negative territory this morning, after weeks of market speculation that it would change tack. The decision, which followed a two-day meeting, sent the yen to its lowest level against the dollar in almost three years and pushed Japanese stocks higher, as the country remains firmly in stimulus mode.
Japan stands out among G7 nations. The B.O.J. has kept its monetary policy loose, in sharp contrast to its central bank peers, which have moved in the opposite direction: raising borrowing costs and offloading trillions in securities from their balance sheets as they try to bring down decades-high inflation.
Japan’s economic problems are very different. The country has been mired in a cycle of prolonged stagflation — the B.O.J. is forecasting inflation at 1.6 percent this year — and has been trying to boost investment. In December, the B.O.J. changed its policy on sovereign bond purchases — known as “yield curve control” — to lure Japanese investors back into the market for treasury notes. That caused yields on government bonds to surge.
That policy has been costly. The B.O.J. said it had spent $265 billion on sovereign bonds since Dec. 20 to try and keep bond yields within its target range — “a whopping 6 percent of annual G.D.P.!”, Deutsche Bank pointed out in a note to clients this morning. But Haruhiko Kuroda, the bank’s governor, defended the policy as “sustainable,” saying it would take time for the yield-curve decision to play out.

Investors looking for a pivot may have to wait for the next B.O.J. governor. Mr. Kuroda, the B.O.J.’s longest serving governor, will step down in April, and his last meeting will be in March. Analysts expect little change in policy until a successor is named.
“It’s playing a game with the U.S. economy and people’s lives that I think is irresponsible.”

Corporate America braces for more activism
After years of declines, the business of shaking up companies for profit returned with a vengeance in 2022, according to Lazard’s latest annual report on shareholder activism. Data compiled by the investment bank showed that the strategy was increasingly popular worldwide, and across industry sectors.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
And 2023 looks likely to continue that pace, as evidenced by new campaigns like Nelson Peltz’s against Disney.
Last year was the biggest for activism since 2018. According to Lazard, 235 campaigns were executed last year. Nontraditional activists — including institutional firms, private equity shops and individual investors — were responsible for 23 percent of campaigns, nearly double the historical average.
That has big ramifications for corporate boards, who need to worry about an ever-growing range of potential activists. “The big headline-grabbing activist funds, they are not really driving the biggest level of activity anymore,” Rich Thomas, a Lazard managing director, told DealBook. “It’s really a broader group of hedge funds engaging in activism and institutional investors that occasionally engage in this or haven’t engaged in this.”
Companies are no longer getting a reprieve for external events. Investors were willing to give corporate boards a break in 2020 and 2021, given shocks to the system like the pandemic and the supply-chain crisis. But that’s changing as stock underperformance rattles investors. The S&P 500 fell more than 19 percent in 2022, its worst year since 2008 during the height of the global financial crisis.
To bolster a lagging stock, activists focused this year on pushing companies to sell themselves or divest divisions, as opposed to revamping operations. (M.&A.-focused demands represented 41 percent of all campaigns last year, according to Lazard.) “Where the real money is is around those strategic and transactional activism theses, as opposed to operational ones,” Thomas said.

No company is too big to avoid activism. It isn’t just Disney facing restive shareholders: Last year investors took on giants like BlackRock, Danone and Salesforce. But even a relatively small or unknown activist can still shake up a corporate titan, given the growing trend of activists “swarming” on a company once it has become a target.
“When a branch breaks, it brings down many others with it,” Thomas said.

Gambling companies have dreamed for decades of operating full-scale, Las Vegas-style casinos in New York City. Now, state authorities are on the brink of opening up the city, the country’s last major untapped gambling market, and a flurry of extravagant proposals are competing for a handful of coveted licenses.
Imagine roulette wheels perched above the women’s wear department at Saks Fifth Avenue. Blackjack by the boardwalk at Coney Island. Card games within spitting distance of the United Nations. Or maybe even a Caesars Entertainment casino steps from the lights of Broadway.
It is easy to understand why so many gambling companies are interested. Greater New York City is home to close to 23 million people and a destination for many millions more tourists each year. “For gambling companies, New York is their Mecca. It’s the last big prize in the United States,” my colleague Dana Rubinstein, who is covering the casino competition, told me.
But until recently, state law and a wall of local opposition short-circuited any serious planning for downstate casinos. What changed? A mix of economic and political factors accelerated by the pandemic. They made casinos in New York City or its suburbs not just palatable but desirable to state leaders, though locals will still have a say.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Today’s newsletter will explain how New York City casinos developed from a notion into a serious prospect.
A decade in the making
There is a long history of politicians from Nevada to Louisiana using legalized gambling to try to stimulate the economy and boost public revenues. The idea has been to push gambling that was once done on the black market onto the tax rolls, and more recently, to keep residents from crossing state lines to gamble.
New York voters first approved a constitutional amendment to allow major casinos in 2013, in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Native American tribes were already operating casinos in New York. But politicians from both parties — many of whom received generous contributions from the gambling industry — said that new casino sites could help create jobs, attract tourists and generate much-needed tax revenue.
To try to maximize the economic impact, New York’s plan stipulated that the companies only be licensed at first to operate in areas most in need of revitalization, well outside of New York City. In the years that followed, casinos opened in the Catskills; outside of Albany; and elsewhere in upstate New York. Some have struggled to meet economic projections.
New York’s gambling plan did provide for the possibility of as many as three downstate casinos, but only after a lengthy delay. And it did not guarantee that the licenses would be granted.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A pandemic-era shift
Now, state leaders are using the same logic that they applied to upstate casinos to try to accelerate and all but ensure the expansion of gambling in and around New York City. Gambling revenue nationwide hit record highs in 2022. In essence, New York is looking for a bigger piece of the action.
The pandemic only made that desire more urgent. Covid hit New York City, the state’s main economic engine, especially hard. Midtown office towers remain only partially full, some wealthy individuals have left for lower-tax states and tourism has yet to rebound to prepandemic levels. The result has been less reliable revenue in city and state coffers, particularly as one-time federal aid sources dry up.
Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams, both Democrats, hope that the new casinos can help offset those financial losses and spark other beneficial development. Lawmakers have projected billions more dollars in licensing fees and regular tax revenues. Analysts, though, caution that those projections may be overly optimistic, and skeptics of the plans say the East Coast gambling market has already grown oversaturated.
There is also another, less obvious but still powerful driving force: New York’s hyper-influential hotel workers union. When the pandemic hit the city’s tourism sector hard, the group said as many as 95 percent of its members were out of work. Now, union leaders see gambling projects as one of their biggest opportunities to create more jobs for their members. The shift has been so important, it is reflected in the union’s recent decision to add “gaming” to its name, the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council.
The group has made itself a useful political weapon for Democrats in recent years, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars and providing scores of campaign volunteers. In exchange, the union has exerted considerable pressure on state leaders to fast-track casinos around New York City, often working closely with gambling companies themselves.

Older paintings used to dominate the art industry. Now they account for a tiny percentage of major auction sales. Contemporary artists with a strong Instagram presence are commanding a market once ruled by European masters.
One example: In 2019, the British artist Flora Yukhnovich’s paintings were selling for about $40,000 each. Then her work spread on Instagram, transforming her into one of the most sought-after young stars in the art world. Her paintings now attract international demand from collectors and sell for as much as $3.6 million.
That’s the same price paid for a 1735 canvas at a Christie’s auction last month. Some young buyers are valuing contemporary art as highly as old master paintings, which many regard as irrelevant and difficult to authenticate and maintain.

Reed Hastings will become executive chairman.
Credit...
Winnie Au for The New York Times
A streaming pioneer steps back
For 25 years, Reed Hastings was not only Netflix’s co-founder, but also its most visible cheerleader and advocate. Yesterday he announced that he would relinquish his co-C.E.O. title to a top deputy and become executive chairman.
The change comes as the streaming giant grapples with one of the most challenging moments in its history: Competitors are coming on strong, and Wall Street is keeping a close eye on its bottom line.
Mr. Hastings’s move had long been in the works. “Our board has been discussing succession planning for many years,” he wrote in a corporate blog post, comparing the move to the changing of the guard at other tech companies — think Jeff Bezos at Amazon last year, or Bill Gates at Microsoft — to give way to the next generation of leadership. (It’s hard not to compare the relative smoothness of this transition to, say, that of a key Netflix rival, Disney.)
Who’s stepping up? Picking up the co-C.E.O. role is Greg Peters, an architect of Netflix’s much-anticipated ad-supported subscription offering, who’ll share the title with the longtime Hastings lieutenant Ted Sarandos. (Setting tongues wagging in Hollywood was the additional news that Bela Bajaria, the company’s head of television who was recently profiled in The New Yorker, was promoted to chief content officer.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Does Mr. Hastings’s move signal anything about Netflix’s prospects? Over the past year, the company has sought to reassure investors about a number of issues, including:
Slowing subscriber growth, plus an actual drop in subscriber numbers last year, which drove a sharp slide in its stock.
Advances by rivals like Disney and Amazon, a tough thing to swallow for a company that regularly says its main competition includes sleep.
Its own multibillion-dollar debt-financed binging on content production, without a clear sense of the return on that investment.
Those challenges prompted Mr. Hastings, who said he had been largely delegating day-to-day management over the past two-and-a-half years, to become more hands-on again. (His reasserted presence was also seen as important as Netflix began taking steps it had long dismissed as unnecessary, like launching the cheaper, ad-supported service and cracking down on password sharing.) Recode’s Peter Kafka surmises that Mr. Hastings’s willingness to change roles might mean he believes Netflix has put the worst behind it. And investors sent shares higher in premarket trading.
Of course, it helped that Netflix had good financial news to report alongside its leadership transition, including better-than-expected subscriber and revenue growth. The question now is whether Netflix is truly in the clear, and whether Mr. Hastings will truly step back as Bezos has thus far — or find that he has to reassert himself again.

Mr. Racine spoke with DealBook about expected developments. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
What’s next in the E.S.G. wars?
We’ve seen governors and treasurers go out and seek to pull money out of certain pension funds because they claim that investment managers are using E.S.G. inappropriately. Well, one can foresee that beneficiaries — having seen the record of returns of the investment managers who are being penalized for using E.S.G. — could organize and tell those states to keep politics out of the investment world.
Can businesses push back?
The Kentucky Bankers Association recently sued the attorney general there to enjoin his investigation into financial institutions’ use of E.S.G. That is significant litigation, and I think that you’re gonna see more and more of this.
What else are you watching?
The area of covenants not to compete is very striking and important, and we saw the F.T.C. move into that arena pretty broadly. The noncompete historically has been used to really restrict and limit hourly wage workers just working to make ends meet. Once you start banning noncompetes all across the board, you’ve got to be really attentive as to what the impacts are and why companies devote time, energy and resources to recruiting and training and promoting people.
What big theme do you see emerging in 2023?
The whole idea of government increasingly playing a role in business and the politicization of how businesses choose to operate. I think you’re going to see a lot around that subject matter, namely about government intrusion into the workings of business.

But the projects could also alter regional weather patterns, and there’s a danger that some countries may act unilaterally before the effects are well understood.
Pre-emptive corporate decoupling from China may accelerate. As tensions between the West and China escalate, wary corporations that fled Russia last year may shift away from China before they’re forced to do so. Notably, Apple is reportedly trying to shift some iPhone production to India, and Alphabet might move some Google Pixel phone manufacturing to Vietnam.
Two key U.S. allies could reconcile and shake up the Indo-Pacific. Japan and South Korea have been at loggerheads for years over grievances that date back to World War II. But there are signs that the neighbors — which each host tens of thousands of American troops — could overcome their differences, a move that would bolster the U.S.’s efforts to present a united front against a more assertive China, North Korea and Russia.
Platform workers are organizing worldwide. Non-contract workers who provide delivery, driving and other services through online platforms are fighting for better conditions and pay, with strikes and protests in Brazil, Britain and the Philippines an indication of a rising movement. Those efforts could lead to more government protections for many in the informal economy.

2023-01-22,"Deepfake technology — software that allows people to swap faces, voices and other characteristics to create digital forgeries — has been used in recent years to make a synthetic substitute of Elon Musk that shilled a cryptocurrency scam, to digitally “undress” more than 100,000 women on Telegram and to steal millions of dollars from companies by mimicking their executives’ voices on the phone.
In most of the world, the authorities can’t do much about it. Even as the software grows more sophisticated and accessible, few laws exist to manage its spread.
China hopes to be the exception. This month, the country adopted expansive rules requiring that manipulated material have the subject’s consent and bear digital signatures or watermarks, and that deepfake service providers offer ways to “refute rumors.”
But China faces the same hurdles that have stymied other efforts to govern deepfakes: The worst abusers of the technology tend to be the hardest to catch, operating anonymously, adapting quickly and sharing their synthetic creations through borderless online platforms. China’s move has also highlighted another reason that few countries have adopted rules: Many people worry that the government could use the rules to curtail free speech.

But simply by forging ahead with its mandates, tech experts said, Beijing could influence how other governments deal with the machine learning and artificial intelligence that power deepfake technology. With limited precedent in the field, lawmakers around the world are looking for test cases to mimic or reject.
“The A.I. scene is an interesting place for global politics, because countries are competing with one another on who’s going to set the tone,” said Ravit Dotan, a postdoctoral researcher who runs the Collaborative A.I. Responsibility Lab at the University of Pittsburgh. “We know that laws are coming, but we don’t know what they are yet, so there’s a lot of unpredictability.”
Deepfakes hold great promise in many industries. Last year, the Dutch police revived a 2003 cold case by creating a digital avatar of the 13-year-old murder victim and publicizing footage of him walking through a group of his family and friends in the present day. The technology is also used for parody and satire, for online shoppers trying on clothes in virtual fitting rooms, for dynamic museum dioramas and for actors hoping to speak multiple languages in international movie releases. Researchers at the M.I.T. Media Lab and UNICEF used similar techniques to study empathy by transforming images of North American and European cities into the battle-scarred landscapes caused by the Syrian war.

But problematic applications are also plentiful. Legal experts worry that deepfakes could be misused to erode trust in surveillance videos, body cameras and other evidence. (A doctored recording submitted in a British child custody case in 2019 appeared to show a parent making violent threats, according to the parent’s lawyer.) Digital forgeries could discredit or incite violence against police officers, or send them on wild goose chases. The Department of Homeland Security has also identified risks including cyberbullying, blackmail, stock manipulation and political instability.

Some experts predict that as much as 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated within a few years.
The increasing volume of deepfakes could lead to a situation where “citizens no longer have a shared reality, or could create societal confusion about which information sources are reliable; a situation sometimes referred to as ‘information apocalypse’ or ‘reality apathy,’” the European law enforcement agency Europol wrote in a report last year.
British officials last year cited threats such as a website that “virtually strips women naked” and that was visited 38 million times in the first eight months of 2021. But there and in the European Union, proposals to set guardrails for the technology have yet to become law.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Attempts in the United States to create a federal task force to examine deepfake technology have stalled. Representative Yvette D. Clarke, a New York Democrat, proposed a bill in 2019 and again in 2021 — the Defending Each and Every Person From False Appearances by Keeping Exploitation Subject to Accountability Act — that has yet to come to a vote. She said she planned to reintroduce the bill this year.

Ms. Clarke said her bill, which would require deepfakes to bear watermarks or identifying labels, was “a protective measure.” By contrast, she described the new Chinese rules as “more of a control mechanism.”
“Many of the sophisticated civil societies recognize how this can be weaponized and destructive,” she said, adding that the United States should be bolder in setting its own standards rather than trailing another front-runner.
“We don’t want the Chinese eating our lunch in the tech space at all,” Ms. Clarke said. “We want to be able to set the baseline for our expectations around the tech industry, around consumer protections in that space.”
But law enforcement officials have said the industry is still unable to detect deepfakes and struggles to manage malicious uses of the technology. A lawyer in California wrote in a law journal in 2021 that certain deepfake rules had “an almost insurmountable feasibility problem” and were “functionally unenforceable” because (usually anonymous) abusers can easily cover their tracks.
The rules that do exist in the United States are largely aimed at political or pornographic deepfakes. Marc Berman, a Democrat in California’s State Assembly who represents parts of Silicon Valley and has sponsored such legislation, said he was unaware of any efforts to enforce his laws via lawsuits or fines. But he said that, in deference to one of his laws, a deepfaking app had removed the ability to mimic President Donald J. Trump before the 2020 election.

Only a handful of other states, including New York, restrict deepfake pornography. While running for re-election in 2019, Houston’s mayor said a critical ad from a fellow candidate broke a Texas law that bans certain misleading political deepfakes.
“Half of the value is causing more people to be a little bit more skeptical about what they’re seeing on a social media platforms and encourage folks not to take everything at face value,” Mr. Berman said.

But even as technology experts, lawmakers and victims call for stronger protections, they also urge caution. Deepfake laws, they said, risk being both overreaching but also toothless. Forcing labels or disclaimers onto deepfakes designed as valid commentary on politics or culture could also make the content appear less trustworthy, they added.
Digital rights groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation are pushing legislators to relinquish deepfake policing to tech companies, or to use an existing legal framework that addresses issues such as fraud, copyright infringement, obscenity and defamation.

“That’s the best remedy against harms, rather than the governmental interference, which in its implementation is almost always going to capture material that is not harmful, that chills people from legitimate, productive speech,” said David Greene, a civil liberties lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Several months ago, Google began prohibiting people from using its Colaboratory platform, a data analysis tool, to train A.I. systems to generate deepfakes. In the fall, the company behind Stable Diffusion, an image-generating tool, launched an update that hamstrings users trying to create nude and pornographic content, according to The Verge. Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit ban deepfakes that are intended to be misleading.
But laws or bans may struggle to contain a technology that is designed to continually adapt and improve. Last year, researchers from the RAND Corporation demonstrated how difficult deepfakes can be to identify when they showed a set of videos to more than 3,000 test subjects and asked them to identify the ones that were manipulated (such as a deepfake of the climate activist Greta Thunberg disavowing the existence of climate change).
The group was wrong more than a third of the time. Even a subset of several dozen students studying machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University were wrong more than 20 percent of the time.
Initiatives from companies such as Microsoft and Adobe now try to authenticate media and train moderation technology to recognize the inconsistencies that mark synthetic content. But they are in a constant struggle to outpace deepfake creators who often discover new ways to fix defects, remove watermarks and alter metadata to cover their tracks.

“There is a technological arms race between deepfake creators and deepfake detectors,” said Jared Mondschein, a physical scientist at RAND. “Until we start coming up with ways to better detect deepfakes, it’ll be really hard for any amount of legislation to have any teeth.”"

Another activist takes on Marc Benioff
Salesforce has been through a lot of turbulence lately, including a huge round of layoffs and a shake-up in its top ranks. Now it faces a big new threat in Elliott Management, the $55 billion hedge fund that has taken a significant stake in the company.
Elliott’s intervention will only add to the pressure on Salesforce’s co-founder and soon-to-be sole C.E.O., Marc Benioff, to bolster the software giant’s performance as it deals with an already challenging economic environment.
It isn’t clear what Elliott wants. The hedge fund, whose multibillion-dollar stake was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by DealBook, is known for shaking up huge companies, with demands that have included cost cuts, replacing executives and selling off businesses.
For now, Elliott is taking a cordial public approach. “We look forward to working constructively with Salesforce to realize the value befitting a company of its stature,” Jesse Cohn, managing partner at the hedge fund, said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Salesforce is already battling another big activist: Starboard Value announced in October that it had built a stake and noted that the company has been underperforming its peers, but hasn’t publicly called for specific measures.
Mr. Benioff faces a number of challenges. Salesforce has seen its market value drop by roughly half since its peak in 2021, to $150 billion. It laid off 10 percent of its work force in the fall, after what Benioff said was excessive hiring in the tech market boom during the pandemic. Its co-C.E.O., Bret Taylor, is expected to step down this month, after what The Journal said was tension with Benioff. And Salesforce has been criticized for a multibillion-dollar acquisition spree that skeptics say hasn’t paid off.
That’s on top of a tough economic environment, which has driven companies to spend less on services like the software tools that Salesforce sells.
What’s next? Potential moves include more cost cuts — Salesforce still employs 71,000, more than it did before the pandemic — and a higher bar for doing takeovers. But Elliott hasn’t shied away from demanding a shake-up in executive ranks or selling off divisions, and its voice carries a lot of weight with other investors.
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Ken Griffin sets a record for hedge fund profits. His Citadel earned $16 billion last year, according to LCH Investments, beating the $15.6 billion that John Paulson collected in 2007 by betting against subprime mortgages in what was once called the “greatest trade ever.” But the picture was grimmer for hedge funds as a whole: The industry lost $208 billion last year.

The Biden administration dismisses a popular suggestion for ending the debt ceiling standoff. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the Fed is unlikely to accept a $1 trillion platinum coin that the U.S. would mint and then deposit at the central bank to provide funds to pay its debts, The Wall Street Journal reports. That removes the prospect of an easy solution for helping the country avoid a default later this year.
Brazil and Argentina begin talks on creating a common currency. The move by South America’s biggest economies could eventually grow to include other countries. It could eventually make the continent one of the world’s biggest currency blocs and reduce global reliance on the U.S. dollar.
Elizabeth Holmes may have tried to flee the U.S. In a court filing, prosecutors said the Theranos founder bought a one-way plane ticket to Mexico shortly after being convicted on fraud charges last January. She didn’t go on the trip, but they argue she has demonstrated a flight risk.

A new White House C.O.O.
With the departure of his chief of staff, Ron Klain, President Biden is losing his top lieutenant, and Corporate America is losing an ally. But they may find another in his replacement, Jeffrey Zients, who, as a former entrepreneur and management executive, has strong business credentials of his own. A drawback: He’s perceived to lack the political savvy of the highly influential Klain.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Zients won’t go it alone. As former coronavirus response coordinator, Mr. Zients oversaw a highly successful vaccination campaign despite no public health experience.
Still, the administration plans to spread out Mr. Klain’s responsibilities to several officials, including Anita Dunn, a senior Biden adviser and political and communications strategist whose former clients include AT&T, Lyft, Pfizer, Salesforce and Reddit; Steven Ricchetti, White House counselor and a former lobbyist, who like Mr. Klain is known to field calls from Wall Street; and Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, a deputy chief of staff and a co-founder of a consulting firm that advised Gates Ventures and other corporate clients.
Washington will be losing a communicator. Mr. Klain is reportedly always on and available to talk, whether with people on Wall Street; in the wee hours on the phone with the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer; or over a glass of wine on the houseboat of Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia.
Mr. Klain has deep connections throughout Washington: He previously served as chief of staff for Vice President Al Gore; worked as a lobbyist at the law firm O’Melveny & Myers, for clients like Cigna, Fannie Mae, Time Warner and US Airways; and worked at Revolution LLC, a tech investment firm started by Steve Case, the billionaire co-founder of AOL
Mr. Klain has been one of Biden’s primary negotiators. He has been a reliable interlocutor in fraught times, said Chris Lehane of the crypto investment firm Haun Ventures, who worked for Mr. Klain when he was chief of staff to Gore. “One of the things on the business side people always worry about, or think about, is, ‘Who is in the room that matters when big things are going down?’”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
With Mr. Klain, Corporate America knew that someone very high up “would ask the right questions and consider all the issues,” Mr. Lehane told DealBook, likening the role of chief of staff to that of “C.O.O. of the federal government.” (Republicans called Klain “Prime Minister Klain.”)
Crypto’s spreading collapse
Traditional financial institutions are cooling on crypto. Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, said yesterday that one of its partners, Signature Bank, was reducing its exposure to digital assets and would only handle dollar transactions for customers of the company worth more than $100,000.
Regulators have warned banks about “safety and soundness.” The Fed, the F.D.I.C. and Office of the Comptroller of Currency issued a joint statement this month outlining the risks for institutions handling crypto. These included fraud, potential runs on assets and contagion.
The industry’s big players are deeply entwined. The crypto lender Genesis, which says its collapse was set off by the fall of FTX, will have its first bankruptcy hearing today. Genesis froze hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets in November that it lent out via a yield product on the crypto exchange Gemini, leaving the latter’s customers in the lurch and the two companies facing charges of offering a nonregistered security by the S.E.C. But even as Genesis was struggling, former executives named in the filing were trying to woo investors to a new crypto hedge fund.

Lawyers may be the only winners in crypto right now. After objections from senators, creditor representatives and the founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, a Delaware bankruptcy court on Friday ruled that the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell could continue to work on the case. Bankman-Fried has accused the firm of conflicts of interest based on previous work it had done for his companies.

Investors see big returns in pro tennis
The stunners at the Australian Open keep coming, with No. 1 seed Iga Swiatek going down to defeat on Monday. The drama is growing off the court, too. A coterie of billionaires, deep-pocketed companies and star players are engaged in a high-stakes battle to remake the tennis business, report The Times Mathew Futterman and DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch.

Professional tennis has roughly one billion fans worldwide, and estimated annual revenues of $2.5 billion — a fraction of the N.F.L.’s $18 billion juggernaut business. Tennis players receive a much smaller percentage of the pot, and, critics say, poor management, excess bureaucracy and matches that go long into the night are capping the sport’s potential.
The private equity firm CVC Capital Partners believes the game is ripe for disruption. In seeking to buy a 20 percent stake in the Women’s Tennis Association, the firm wants to increase prize money for players and ensure it’s more equitably distributed between men and women. CVC also wants to gain a foothold with the Association of Tennis Professionals, the men’s tennis league, possibly opening up a path to investment there as well.
“This is definitely the time to go long on tennis, 100 percent,” the billionaire investor Bill Ackman told The Times. Mr. Ackman is funding a fledgling players’ organization led by the Serbian star Novak Djokovic. That group is searching for ways to grow the sport’s financial pie and the size of the players’ slice. One idea they’re mulling: a player-run fifth Grand Slam tournament.
The week ahead
A parade of tech earnings and economic data releases will give investors plenty to ponder. Major markets in China will be closed this week for the Lunar New Year festivities. Here’s what’s happening:

Taylor Swift will be much discussed at today’s Senate hearing.

Ticketmaster in the hot seat
Two months after Ticketmaster canceled sales for Taylor Swift’s upcoming Eras tour, a top executive from its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, will appear at the Senate on Tuesday to defend the company. (Ms. Swift herself is not scheduled to show up.)
Expect lawmakers to pepper Live Nation’s president and C.F.O., Joe Berchtold, with questions about whether its grip on ticket sales for the concert and events industry — it controls about 70 percent, by some critics’ reckoning — is too tight.
“However you look at it, that’s a monopoly,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, told Rolling Stone. Critics have accused Live Nation of using its market dominance to charge high fees and of threatening to ice out venues from Live Nation events if they don’t use Ticketmaster. (The Times reported in November that the Justice Department was looking into the company.)
Taking on Ticketmaster is a bipartisan affair: Standing beside Ms. Klobuchar in announcing a hearing on concert ticketing last fall was Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. “It strikes me as being kind of problematic that they’re the only game in town,” Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, told The New Republic.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ticketmaster is no stranger to criticism over its dominance. In 2019, Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, urged the Justice Department to investigate the “broken” ticket industry.
Artists have long complained about Ticketmaster’s role. The band Lawrence, whose co-founder, Clyde Lawrence, wrote a Times Opinion essay on the topic last year, included the line “Live Nation is a monopoly” in its 2021 song “False Alarms.” Perhaps most famously, Pearl Jam filed an antitrust complaint against Ticketmaster in 1994 — 16 years before it merged with Live Nation — kicking off a federal investigation that ultimately fizzled.
Live Nation strongly denies breaking antitrust law. After the Swift fiasco, it attributed Ticketmaster’s dominance to “the large gap that exists between the quality of the Ticketmaster system and the next best primary ticketing system.” It also argues that Ticketmaster is far from having a monopoly in the secondary market. (Jack Groetzinger, the C.E.O. of SeatGeek, is scheduled to testify on Tuesday as well.)
Still, according to written testimony released ahead of Tuesday’s hearing, Mr. Berchtold of Live Nation will say that “there are several things we could have done better.” He will also seek to blame scalpers’ bots swarming Ticketmaster’s site for ultimately denying fans the ability to buy tickets for the Swift tour, and he has a letter from the country star Garth Brooks calling on Congress to make scalping illegal.

The Justice Department will reportedly sue Google over its digital ad dominance. Prosecutors may file a lawsuit as soon as this week, according to Bloomberg. It would be the department’s second antitrust suit against Google in recent years, and part of a broader crackdown on tech giants.
Another activist investor reportedly emerges at Salesforce. Jeff Ubben of Inclusive Capital has taken a stake in the business software giant and spoken with its co-founder, Marc Benioff, according to CNBC. That would make the third activist to invest in Salesforce, after Starboard Value and Elliott Management.
Elon Musk says he could have secured funding to take Tesla private. At a trial over his 2018 effort to buy the carmaker, Mr. Musk said that his “funding secured” tweet referred not only to his belief that Saudi Arabia would help finance the deal, but also to his stake in SpaceX, which he could theoretically have borrowed against. Under questioning, he acknowledged he hadn’t mentioned the SpaceX stake in a 2021 deposition.

It’s a rare accusation against a senior F.B.I. official.

Microsoft’s A.I. bet may be more bad news for Salesforce
Microsoft’s decision to invest another $10 billion in the company behind ChatGPT could add to the troubles at Salesforce, which is already dealing with activist investors, a leadership shake-up and laying off thousands of workers. Microsoft plans to integrate ChatGPT technology across products like email, slide shows and spreadsheets.
But DealBook has learned that Microsoft expects this technology to improve its software that manages a company’s interactions with customers — Salesforce’s main business.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Microsoft is doubling down on customer relations software. Last year, Microsoft launched an app called Viva Sales that automates some customer relationship management, or C.R.M., functions across its products, including Teams and Outlook. The app can, for example, automatically write a meeting summary, which it then uses to track progress on goals discussed.
ChatGPT boosts this sector’s revenue potential for Microsoft. The product “will only get better with GPT,” Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, said, adding that the technology could also help curate content ideas or automate repetitive tasks like email.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Guggenheim Partners analyst John DiFucci estimates that C.R.M. could eventually be a $7 billion opportunity for Microsoft, up from the roughly $3 billion it brings in today. “I always wondered why Microsoft wasn’t a more major player — especially given that they have Outlook, which is sort of a C.R.M. system,” he said.
But Salesforce has a strong incumbent position. The company has been experimenting with its own artificial intelligence; its C.E.O., Marc Benioff, is a declared fan of ChatGPT. And for companies that use Salesforce, the costs of switching providers are high. Still, Microsoft is a formidable competitor and its products are already ubiquitous in corporations.
The addition of A.I. to that arsenal could make its products “more intelligent than what Salesforce has today,” according to Sid Nag, an analyst at Gartner. “And Salesforce has to tell the world how they will respond to that.”
Scenes from Alphabet’s layoff-focused all-hands
After Google’s parent, Alphabet, announced the biggest round of job cuts in its history, senior executives of the tech giant spoke before restive employees to explain why the company had laid off 12,000 of their colleagues so abruptly — and why those who remain shouldn’t lose heart.

Highlights from Monday’s town hall meeting, according to news reports:
It was impossible to give managers more warning about the cuts, Alphabet’s chief people officer, Fiona Cicconi, said: “In an ideal world, we would have given managers a heads-up, but we have over 30,000 managers at Google.”
Top executives will have their bonuses cut by an unspecified amount.
Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s C.F.O., denied that investors — including the activist shareholder TCI, which disclosed a stake in the company and demanded cost cuts — had driven the layoff decisions.
Laid-off workers saw their access to internal systems cut immediately out of an abundance of caution, according to Royal Hansen, Google’s vice president of security. The move irked some employees.
Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s C.E.O., reminded employees that 2023 would be pivotal as the company confronts a host of business challenges. “It will be an important year given the rapid advancements in A.I.,” he said, echoing the company’s “code-red” warnings about threats like ChatGPT.
“Redditors, thank you so much for helping create the best pipeline we’ve ever had.”

The tech stock rally faces a dose of reality
Sweeping layoffs, looming regulatory trouble, the prospect of upstarts like ChatGPT causing a “code red” disruption at tech giants — none of these challenges appear to bother investors.
The Nasdaq Composite has gained 8.6 percent so far this year. Investors have been buying tech stocks in the belief that inflation is easing enough for the Fed to begin slowing the pace of its interest rate increases.

Tech titans are among the best-performing stocks in 2023, with the FANG+ Index — which includes such tech giants as Amazon, Apple, Meta and Netflix — up 14.8 percent in 2023, on pace for its best month since August 2020.
Image
But the rally could hit trouble as soon as Tuesday. Microsoft will report earnings after markets close, the first of the big tech companies to do so. Investors will be paying close attention to its full-year outlook for any signs of a pickup in customers’ I.T. spending. Before the recent rally, analysts had been cutting their earnings forecasts for tech companies, speculating that a slowing economy would crimp revenues and profits.
Some warn that the January rebound could fade — and fast. “Investors should not assume that the easy times in the market are coming back,” David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, a wealth management firm, wrote in an investor note on Monday. “We expect enhanced volatility” as the prospect of a recession still looms.

2023-01-25,"Microsoft restored access to its email and video conferencing tools on Wednesday after thousands of users were unable to connect to the services for hours.
The outage, which affected Microsoft 365 products including Outlook and Microsoft Teams, began shortly after 2 a.m. Eastern time. The company said on Twitter around 5 a.m. Eastern time that it had “isolated the problem to a networking configuration issue.”
At 7:45 a.m., the company said all of its services were available.
The programs are crucial for many businesses, who were temporarily left without key communication services. The company did not say how many users were affected, but thousands of people reported outages, with some people grousing on social media.
Microsoft announced its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday, reporting its slowest growth in six years, with profit falling 12 percent and revenue rising 2 percent from a year earlier; both figures fell below Wall Street expectations. The earnings report came after the tech giant said it was making a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar” investment in OpenAI, the start-up that designed the chatbot ChatGPT, as Microsoft seeks to push artificial intelligence technology further and compete with rivals like Amazon, Apple and Google.
The company announced last week that it would lay off 10,000 employees, less than five percent of its payroll."
2023-01-26,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, the fast-casual food chain, said on Thursday that it planned to hire 15,000 workers ahead of its busiest time of year, a sharp contrast to the other large companies that are laying off employees because of pandemic overexpansion and worries about the economy.
The company said in a statement that it was preparing for what it described as “burrito season,” from March to May, when it typically has most of its business.
“We will continue bringing in new crew to support Chipotle’s aggressive growth plans,” Scott Boatwright, Chipotle’s chief restaurant officer, said in a statement. The company employs more than 100,000 people at more than 3,000 restaurants across North America. Its long-term plan calls for eventually running 7,000 outlets.
Unlike Chipotle, many companies are shedding staff and cutting costs. Tech companies in particular have recently announced layoffs, with tens of thousands of job cuts at Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and others. Industrial firms like Dow, banks like Goldman Sachs and media companies like The Washington Post have also recently laid off employees.

The Federal Reserve has been paying close attention to the labor market as it raises interest rates to bring inflation under control by slowing the economy. The most recent data showed that U.S. employers added fewer jobs in December than in earlier months, but the pace of hiring remained solid.
A spokeswoman for Chipotle said in an email that the company frequently had the most sales in the spring because of “weather and daylight.” She added that restaurants in college areas did well when school was in session. The company opened more than 200 restaurants last year and plans to open up to 285 this year, the spokeswoman said, and it anticipates it will need to recruit more workers.
Wells Fargo analysts expressed doubt about Chipotle’s ability to hire, given “pockets of wage pressure,” they wrote in a report. The company has so far been able to offset higher pay and recruiting costs by raising menu prices, but signs of slower sales late last year suggest that may not last.
In its latest earnings report, for the third quarter of 2022, Chipotle recorded a profit of nearly $260 million, up more than 20 percent from a year earlier. In October, the company said its prices were on track to rise by nearly 15 percent in 2022 as it, like many consumer-facing companies, passed on higher costs to consumers."

D.C. diplomacy, Musk style
Elon Musk showed up in Washington yesterday to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, setting off speculation about what the billionaire C.E.O. of Twitter, Tesla and SpaceX was up to.
Happy birthday, Mr. Speaker. Mr. McCarthy, a California Republican, was tight-lipped when he spoke to reporters after their conversation, saying only that they were old friends and that Mr. Musk had come to offer his best wishes on Mr. McCarthy’s 58th birthday.
But Mr. Musk indicated that the visit was all about business, and that it included a chat with the top House Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries of New York. “Just met with @SpeakerMcCarthy & @RepJeffries to discuss ensuring that this platform is fair to both parties,” Mr. Musk tweeted (though he reportedly didn’t have a scheduled meeting with the Democrat and met him in passing in Mr. McCarthy’s office).
Mr. Musk and Mr. McCarthy go way back. The Twitter boss supported the Republican in his drawn-out bid to become speaker this month and spoke at a G.O.P. retreat that Mr. McCarthy hosted in Wyoming last summer. Mr. McCarthy has stood up for Mr. Musk, too, telling the Biden administration to stop picking on him after he bought Twitter.

One of Mr. McCarthy’s first moves as speaker was to form a new panel on the supposed “weaponization” of the government to investigate President Biden’s efforts to pressure social media platforms. The decision was partly inspired by the so-called Twitter Files, internal documents Mr. Musk released to a few independent journalists, including some about the company’s handling of reporting on Hunter Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election, when Jack Dorsey was running the company.
The House is investigating Twitter. The Oversight Committee is planning a hearing on the Hunter Biden issue. Conservatives contend that the Twitter Files are an example of a wider campaign by the left to suppress unfavorable information on social media and smother voices on the right. Mr. Musk, a self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist, has vowed to rectify this now that he owns the company.
Mr. Musk isn’t the only ally the speaker has spoken up for. Mr. McCarthy tried to use his position to push the company to reinstate the personal account of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia after she was kicked off the platform last year for violating its coronavirus misinformation policy. The revelation prompted the blog Techdirt to ask: Where are the Twitter Files for Mr. McCarthy?
Mr. Musk’s mission to build out a fair platform comes as the company is still facing blowback from his leadership. More than 500 advertisers have reportedly paused spending since he took over, with ad revenue down about 40 percent on concerns about content moderation.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Elliott reportedly prepares for a board fight at Salesforce. The hedge fund is interviewing candidates to nominate as directors for the business software giant, according to The Wall Street Journal. Salesforce is said to be weighing its own board shake-up — including the potential addition of Mason Morfit, the C.E.O. of the activist fund ValueAct, Bloomberg reports.

Shares in companies controlled by the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani have fallen as much as 20 percent since Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of fraud.

Why markets will zero in on today’s inflation data
Investors have been in a buying mood so far, pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to a new high for 2023 yesterday. A big test of that conviction will come today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern when the Commerce Department releases new data on the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge.
Economists expect more good news. They are forecasting that the P.C.E. rose 4.4 percent on an annual basis last month, which is still too high for the Fed’s liking, but down sharply from the 6.3 percent reading in August.
Behind the Journalism

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
If so, that would add more fuel to investor speculation that the Fed will begin to ease up on, or even end, its policy of interest rate increases by midyear. Markets rose after yesterday’s gross domestic product data showed that the U.S. economy grew more than expected in the fourth quarter.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq has now gained 10.8 percent this year. Tech stocks (and, particularly, high-growth ones) have historically performed better when inflation moderates and bond yields fall. On cue, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes has fallen by 31 basis points this year as investors pour money into long-dated sovereign bonds.

Even still, recession fears persist. Market watchers are closely tracking bond yields for signs of an inverted yield curve — this time, involving interest rates on 10-year bonds falling below 2-year notes.
“An inverted yield curve means the government can borrow for 10 years at a cheaper interest rate than it can for two years or even three months, which typically only happens ahead of or during a recession,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, warned in a note to clients yesterday.
Blackstone’s up-and-down quarter
Blackstone’s fourth-quarter earnings report yesterday presented a mixed picture of the investment giant’s performance — including more news about investment funds that have been in Wall Street’s focus for weeks.

Investors still want to pull money from Blackstone’s real estate funds. Executives said they’re working through a backlog of requests to withdraw money from the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, or Breit, a huge nontraded fund meant for wealthy individuals, after an increase in such requests last year. But the firm also disclosed that it faces over $5 billion in requests to withdraw money from BPP, a fund aimed at institutional investors.
Blackstone is still limiting redemption requests, though the firm pointed to a $4 billion investment in Breit by the investment manager for the University of California — and an additional $500 million the system pledged on Wednesday. It also reported that Breit had posted an 8.4 percent return for 2022. (Jon Gray, Blackstone’s president, added that concern about redemptions had been overblown: “The media has created a different narrative, but the customers are fundamentally happy,” he told analysts.)
The firm also fell short of an ambitious fund-raising goal. Assets under management rose to $974.7 billion last year, up 11 percent year-on-year. But that’s still shy of the $1 trillion that Blackstone had expected to reach in 2022.
Still, investors appeared undeterred: Blackstone’s shares rose more than 5 percent yesterday.

The McDonald’s ruling everyone is talking about
A landmark Delaware chancery court ruling this week could put a whole new rank of company officials in the legal firing line for breaches of fiduciary duties — not just the board.
“Duty of oversight” extends beyond directors. Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster ruled that David Fairhurst, former global chief people officer at McDonald’s, could be sued by shareholders who accused him of allowing a “culture of sexual misconduct and harassment to develop” at the company. (Mr. Fairhurst took on the role shortly after Steve Easterbrook became C.E.O., and both men were fired following allegations of inappropriate behavior.) When it comes to breaches of fiduciary duties — like so-called “duty of oversight” — Delaware courts have typically ruled that the buck stops with the board. Fairhurst had sought that very legal protection, but Mr. Laster, in a first-of-its-kind ruling for the court, rejected the argument.
This has huge implications for officer liability. Giving company executives the “duty of oversight,” given that they manage much of a company’s daily operations, means they can be sued for big money — millions, or even billions. (Many of these lawsuits would be covered by directors and insurance liability, said Kevin LaCroix, a lawyer who specializes in such matters.)
Several lawyers told DealBook that, in this case, the level of oversight responsibility is defined so broadly that it opens the floodgates to lawsuits. What happens, for example, to the chief information security officer whose company is hacked? Expect a rash of reports from corporate law firms criticizing the decision.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Others argued that perhaps courts have for too long given executives the benefit of the doubt, and that the threat of eye-popping shareholder lawsuits is far more powerful in ensuring rightful duty than, say, the possibility of a $10,000 settlement in an employment lawsuit (a more typical remedy for something like allowing a corrosive culture).

Some experts say that when artificial intelligence takes off, it’s going to be like Martians landing on the National Mall.
So far, our mind children, as the roboticist Hans Moravec called our artificially intelligent offspring, are in the toddler phase, as we ooh and aah at the novelty of our creation. They’re headed for the rebellious teenage phase. When A.I. hurtles into adulthood and isn’t so artificial anymore, we’ll be relegated to being the family pets, as a resigned Steve Wozniak put it.
Silicon Valley is reeling at the prowess of an experimental chatbot called ChatGPT, released by OpenAI in late November and deemed “scary good” by Elon Musk. Musk, one of the founders with Sam Altman, left and now Microsoft is a partner.
There’s keening that ChatGPT — couldn’t they have come up with a better name, like HAL? — will eliminate millions of jobs. Why hire a college graduate if a bot can do the same work faster and cheaper? No more arguments about work-from-home rules, no more union fights. You don’t need to lure A.I. back into the office with pizza.

We seem headed toward a Matrix where “it will become cheaper to show fakes than to show reality,” Jaron Lanier, the father of virtual reality, wrote in Tablet.

What’s Up? (Jan. 22-28)
Job Cuts, and Not Just in Tech
What began as a wave of ominous job cuts by technology companies is rippling through other industries, most recently media and retail. In the last week alone, layoffs, or reports of coming layoffs, have swept The Washington Post, Vox and Saks.com. Adding to the tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers, Spotify said on Monday that it was cutting 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, and IBM announced on Wednesday that it would shed 3,900. Tech’s challenges may be somewhat particular to the sector — employers have largely pointed to overhiring during the pandemic as a reason for the recent cuts — but its upheaval can be an indicator of where the economy is heading. Yet even as layoffs appear to creep across the job market, unemployment claims overall remain low, and millions of jobs are open across the country.
A Growing Economy
Despite what might seem to be obvious harbingers of an economic downturn — mass layoffs, for example — there are other signs of relative health. Take gross domestic product, an indicator that was not as reliable at the beginning of the pandemic but has since normalized. The latest report on G.D.P., when adjusted for inflation, shows the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, suggesting that it has been largely resilient in the face of inflation, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Though just a few months ago, G.D.P. numbers met one commonplace standard for determining a recession, the most recent data would seem to assuage fears. But only to a certain extent —  many economists still expect a recession to begin later this year.
Elon Musk Takes the Stand
More than four years after he posted a tweet telling his followers that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private, Elon Musk, now the chief executive of both Tesla and Twitter, appeared in court to defend that statement against a lawsuit. He provided seven hours of testimony over three days, arguing that funding for a deal with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund was plentiful but dodging a question about whether a specific dollar amount had been discussed. In the 2018 tweet, Mr. Musk suggested that he had secured $420 a share (a favorite number of the billionaire’s). Lawyers for the plaintiffs, a group of Tesla investors, are trying to build a case to prove that Mr. Musk’s actions led to the wild swings in Tesla’s stock, causing them to lose money. Some experts believe they are likely to succeed: Last year, the senior U.S. District Court judge hearing the case ruled that he agreed with the plaintiffs that Mr. Musk was “deliberately reckless” — investors’ words — when he posted the tweet.

What’s Next? (Jan. 29-Feb. 4)
A Smaller Rate Increase?
The Federal Reserve took its first step toward slowing its interest rate increases last month, when it broke a streak of aggressive three-quarter-point increases with a half-point one. At its meeting on Tuesday, the central bank may opt to slow its pace further. In recent weeks, Fed officials including Susan M. Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, have discussed the possibility of a quarter-point move. “There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase,” Mr. Waller said. But he echoed his colleagues in emphasizing that their campaign to fight inflation was not over yet, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has made clear officials’ intention to raise the policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of the year.

Labor Market Resilience
The jobs report on Friday will provide the first glimpse at the strength of the labor market in 2023 — though it is expected to look a lot like the end of 2022. That is to say, like recent months of jobs reports, this one is expected to show another month of solid but slowing growth. The question is, how long can these conditions last? While the labor market has long been buoyant in defiance of the Fed’s attempts to cool the economy, the higher interest rates are still slowly permeating through the economy.
Slower Growth for Tech Companies
After a stretch of bad news for the country’s largest tech companies, this week’s quarterly earnings reports are poised to deliver … more bad news. Microsoft helped kicked off the tech-sector portion of earnings season last week by reporting its slowest growth in six years. Amazon, which will release its quarterly results on Thursday, the same day as Alphabet and Apple, is expected to report exceptionally slow growth — the slowest in two decades, analysts predict. While Amazon and its peers may be hurting, these companies continue to bring in billions in profit, and some are making big investments even as they say their aim with layoffs is to trim costs. Days after announcing plans to cut 10,000 jobs, Microsoft, for example, said it planned to invest $10 billion in the artificial intelligence lab behind the chatbot ChatGPT.
What Else?
Live Nation Entertainment, the parent of Ticketmaster, which canceled its plans to sell tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming tour, was cast as a monopoly by top Democrats during a Senate hearing (some used Ms. Swift’s lyrics to make their point). A glitch on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday led to wild price swings for major stocks, adding or wiping out billions in market value. Meta said it would reinstate former President Donald J. Trump’s Instagram and Facebook accounts “in the coming weeks.”"

2023-02-01,"The nation’s demand for labor only got stronger in December, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, as job openings rose to 11 million.
That brings the number of posted jobs per available unemployed worker, which had been easing in recent months, back up to 1.9 — not what the Federal Reserve has been hoping for as it seeks to quell inflation.
“It does make you question whether we continue to see that slowing in net job creation,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at the financial services company Nationwide. “There’s still a strong demand for workers, and that suggests that the labor market is still running very tight, and too hot.”
The 5.5 percent increase in job openings was largely driven by hotels and restaurants, which have been steadily recovering from the pandemic, and jumped sharply to 1.74 million positions posted. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has been particularly focused on wage inflation in the services sector, but like wages more broadly, increases in hourly earnings in private services have been decelerating.

In another sign of confidence among workers, people voluntarily left their jobs at about the same rate as they did in November. Quits as a share of the overall employment base have fallen slightly from 3 percent at the end of 2021, but plateaued over the past few months. Overall, in 2022, about 50 million Americans quit their jobs.
Layoffs were also steady in December, staying at the unusually low level that has prevailed since a spike during the pandemic. While pink slips in the tech industry have mounted swiftly — most recently with 22,000 between Microsoft and Google — the bulk of the separations may have occurred after the labor turnover survey ended.
Other indicators that employers are shedding workers, such as initial claims for unemployment insurance, have also remained very low by historical standards. Those leaving tech jobs, especially with software development and engineering skills, may have found new opportunities so quickly that they didn’t file for unemployment benefits."
2023-02-02,"For much of last year, tech companies stumbled. Digital ad sales plunged. E-commerce sputtered. IPhone production stalled. And investors lost faith.
It was the worst year that the tech industry had experienced on Wall Street since the financial crisis of 2008. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta lost a combined $3.9 trillion in market value.
Now chastened, many tech companies have begun the year by championing a new and unfamiliar business strategy: austerity.
In recent months, several companies have said they are looking for ways to cut costs and eliminate futuristic projects that have become money pits. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have each announced plans to lay off more than 10,000 workers.

It is an abrupt turn for an industry that became famous for its big salaries, extravagant offices and lavish perks, from free shuttle buses to free laundry services for employees. But as a boom that lasted 15 years comes to an end, shrinking profits are making tech executives rethink what they believed were important tools in an industrywide competition to hoard tech talent.
On Thursday, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, said it was “committed to investing responsibly, with great discipline.” Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, assured investors that the company would be “thoughtful and deliberate.” And Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, made his first appearance on a call with analysts since taking over from Jeff Bezos about 18 months ago and underscored how hard the company had worked to corral what looked like runaway costs.
Their message built on the tone that Mark Zuckerberg set for the industry on Wednesday when he called 2023 “the year of efficiency.” During a call with analysts, in which “efficiency” was said more than 30 times, Mr. Zuckerberg talked about spending less on infrastructure, removing layers of management and killing dead-end projects.
Investors are cheering tech’s new faith in financial discipline. Shares of Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, jumped more than 23 percent on Thursday, its biggest daily gain in nearly a decade. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple all rallied, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 3 percent.
“People wanted to get back in, and they wanted to figure out when the water is safe to wade into,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, an investment firm. He added that the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to increase interest rates by a modest quarter-point helped tech companies as well, because it suggested that the central bank was getting inflation under control.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“You don’t need much good news for the stocks to outperform,” Mr. Mahaney said.
But shares of several of those companies dropped in after-hours trading on Thursday evening after they reported disappointing results for the most recent quarter, making it clear that tech’s business challenges remain.
On Thursday, Google reported its second decline in advertising, ever. Amazon said that its lucrative cloud computing business had slowed and that sales in its core e-commerce business had declined. And Apple posted its biggest decline in Christmas season iPhone sales since 2018.
On Wednesday, Meta reported that its sales in the final three months of last year had fallen 4 percent. Last week, Microsoft said spending on cloud computing was weakening.
The market’s reaction to lackluster tech earnings could be an indication of what is to come for the broader economy. Economists are trying to assess whether the economy can avoid a deep recession and achieve what some are calling a soft landing. If tech, as the most prominent industry to weaken last year, finds a bottom and begins to rebound, it would be an illustration of the relative strength of the broader economy, said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist.
“Six months ago, the economy was contracting and interest rates were rising, and there was a rebalance away from the pandemic,” Mr. Furman said. “That perfect storm,” he added, “isn’t true any more.”

Alphabet, Amazon and Apple all reported quarterly results that largely fell short of Wall Street expectations on Thursday. Alphabet posted its fourth consecutive decline in profit as it grappled with a slowdown in digital advertising. Advertising sales at YouTube, Google’s video platform, dipped nearly 8 percent to $7.96 billion, below the $8.2 billion expected by analysts.
As Google’s sales slow, Mr. Pichai said, the company is making various efforts to tame expenses. They include improving the financial performance of its phones and other gadgets, trying to make its cloud division profitable and strengthening YouTube’s business.
“I see this as an important journey to re-engineer the company’s cost base in a durable way,” Mr. Pichai said.
At Amazon, Mr. Jassy has been pushing to trim costs for the past year. The company has been working through plans to lay off 18,000 corporate and tech workers, it added fees for grocery deliveries that had once been free, and it cut back from a breakneck warehouse expansion that left it with too much space.
Still, Amazon barely eked out a profit, producing just $278 million in net income during the December quarter, as sales rose 9 percent from a year earlier to $149.2 billion.

During the call with analysts, Mr. Jassy said he had been focused on reducing the costs associated with fulfilling and delivering packages. The company vastly expanded its warehouses and hiring during the pandemic to keep pace with demand. Even after almost a year of pulling back expansion, he said, “there is a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient.”
Apple lost an estimated $7 billion in iPhone sales during the December quarter when its largest iPhone factory in China was locked down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. The company offset those losses with strong sales of iPads, which increased 30 percent, and services such as subscriptions to Apple Music.
Mr. Cook said macroeconomic factors, including inflation and the war in Ukraine, had contributed to the company’s struggles. In the face of those challenges, the company said, it is reining in spending, which will help improve its profit margins.
“We’re doing a lot of work around costs,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer. “That is paying off.”
There are still regulatory efforts to curb the industry’s power, including a lawsuit that the Department of Justice brought last month against Google, claiming it has abused its position as an advertising technology monopoly. But the impacts of those actions are far in the future.

The tech industry has been relatively effective at holding regulators at bay. On Wednesday, a federal judge rejected the Federal Trade Commission’s request to stop Meta from buying a virtual reality start-up. Last year, Washington lobbyists effectively stymied bills in Congress that aimed to open up competition on app stores and prevent tech companies from giving their own products preference on their platforms.
“Some of the pressure has come off because these guys have been hit so hard and had to lay off so many people,” said Bob O’Donnell, president of Technalysis Research, a firm specializing in tech research. “There’s a realization that they’re not omnipotent after all.”"
2023-02-03,"Soft landing? The American labor market is still soaring.
After months of gentle but steady declines in job growth, employers unleashed an unexpected burst of hiring in January, adding 517,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said on Friday.
The increase was the largest since July, and it drew exclamations from economists steeped in labor market trends, who had been expecting another month of gradual cooling.
“So much for moderation!” said Beth Ann Bovino, the chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. “We certainly didn’t see it in this report.”
Underscoring the labor market’s extraordinary vibrancy was the unemployment rate, which fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest level since 1969.

But even as businesses hired with striking zeal in January — or at least laid off fewer seasonal employees than in most years — wage growth continued to moderate. Average hourly earnings increased 0.3 percent from December, and 4.4 percent over the year, an indication that some of the pressure to lure employees with pay raises may be easing.

“Put simply, I would argue the Biden economic plan is working,” President Biden proclaimed in remarks at the White House, while dismissing the “chorus of critics” who had faulted it.
Still, the hefty hiring figures underscored the challenges facing the Federal Reserve, which is trying to cool the labor market in its effort to tame rapid inflation. By raising interest rates — on Wednesday, Fed officials did so for the eighth time in a year — policymakers hope to force businesses to pull back on their spending, including hiring.
The moves appeared to have been tamping down the labor market, with limited pain for workers. Since the summer, job gains had eased but remained above 250,000 a month, and layoffs were extremely low, notwithstanding a cavalcade of pink slips from technology companies.

Other recent measures were also offering reasons to believe the economy was coming off its rolling boil. Consumer spending fell at the end of last year, a sign that Americans were finally becoming more cautious in the face of rising prices, dwindling savings and fears of recession. And the housing market appeared to be slowing down, as high mortgage rates were making purchases too expensive for many would-be homeowners, though there has been some recent easing.
January’s hiring figures suggest that officials may have more work to do to reduce the labor market’s momentum and bring the economy more into balance.
The report showed that job gains were broad, touching even some industries that had been expected to slow as the Fed’s rate increases filtered through the labor market. Leading the charge were leisure and hospitality businesses, including restaurants, bars and hotels, which added 128,000 jobs, and health care, which added 58,000 — both sectors that were upended during the pandemic. Professional and business services also ramped up their hiring.
There was a substantial jump in government employment, too, though that was partly because striking workers at the University of California returned to work.
The information sector lost 5,000 jobs. But even that was a relative blip given the recent headline-grabbing layoffs at technology giants such as Microsoft and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

“I would definitely say at the end of 2022, there was a slowdown in some industries,” said Nicola Hancock, managing director for the Americas region at AMS, a talent acquisition and advisory firm. But she added, “All of our clients are still hiring.” AMS works with blue-chip companies in industries including banking, financial services, technology and pharmaceuticals.
Further complicating the narrative, some emerging trends in the job market that had hinted at an impending economic slowdown appeared to backtrack. The number of hours worked rose, including in manufacturing and construction. And jobs in temporary help services, which tend to fall amid economic uncertainty, rose by 26,000 after months of declines.
The figures in Friday’s report are preliminary and will be revised at least twice.
The labor force participation rate was barely changed at 62.4 percent. Fed officials have been hoping to see an increase in the ranks of those available to work, which could alleviate the tightness in the labor market that is driving up wages and contributing to inflation.

If the report was befuddling, it also reaffirmed a prevailing impression: that the labor market is strong. After the upheaval from the pandemic’s onset, little has fundamentally knocked employers off course. Buoyed by seemingly bottomless demand for goods and services, businesses have been in a race to hire despite climbing borrowing costs, offering raises and a cornucopia of incentives to lure workers.

Last year, 4.6 million jobs were added, not including seasonal adjustments — nearly 200,000 more than initially reported, and the second most since records began in 1939.
With wage pressure subsiding somewhat, one possible explanation for the fresh surge in hiring was that businesses could more easily fill open positions.
“Basically, the hesitation and confusion that I think made it harder for employers and workers to find each other in the early parts of the recovery has started to abate,” said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. “People are applying for jobs, and employers have a better understanding of what the labor market landscape looks like.”
In addition to the report on Friday, the government released data this week showing that job openings in December rose to 11 million. The number of posted jobs per available unemployed worker — a measure that policymakers have been watching closely — also increased.
Some businesses that were unable to compete on wages with bigger companies are now finding themselves in advantageous positions, said Stephanie Miller, the director of talent acquisition and retention at Express Employment International, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City.

“We’ve all been working so lean for so long there’s not a lot of small to medium businesses that have extra,” she said. “They are just holding steady, continuing their growth, and they’re going to ride this out.”
That was the case for C&L Supreme of Des Plaines, Ill., which makes component parts for equipment such as document scanners and sorters. The company struggled last year to hire enough workers and largely operated with a staffing deficit — even after cutting an entire shift on the production floor in 2021, said Tom Hacker, C&L Supreme’s chairman.
“Regardless of our business level, we had positions to fill,” he said. Like many other companies, he cited a wide range of challenges, including a lack of qualified applicants.
But last month, Mr. Hacker said, the floodgates seemed to have opened, and the company was suddenly able to hire three employees, boosting its work force to about 35.
“The job climate or job market was really kind of weird and different coming out of Covid and through all of last year,” he said. “I think that’s starting to settle down some now for a couple of reasons.”

Many forecasters ‌expect the labor market to weaken this year as higher interest rates are increasingly felt. In its most recent region-by-region survey, known as the Beige Book, the Fed said businesses across the country “generally expected little growth in the months ahead.”
But it is not clear whether that will translate to widespread layoffs. Many businesses, after struggling to hire workers, may be reluctant to let them go and may try to adjust elsewhere, including offering fewer benefits. Some economists noted that employers might not have cut as many seasonal workers as is typical at the beginning of the year, contributing to the large seasonally adjusted gain in jobs.
“Business executives are looking at various creative ways to limit their labor costs, and that is going to be appearing in various forms,” said Gregory Daco, the chief economist at EY-Parthenon, Ernst & Young’s strategy consultancy. “We’re probably not going to see the types of rapid acceleration in layoffs that we’ve seen in prior cycles.”
Other businesses are taking a more deliberate approach to hiring as they see what the coming months bring.
Andy Sommer, an owner and chief executive of Forth & Nomad, a women’s lifestyle clothing and accessories store in Houston, said that though sales had increased 30 percent last year, he worried about hiring too many people before economic conditions become clearer. So while he is looking to replace workers who left after the holiday season, he is also trying different scheduling approaches and hoping managers can fill in any gaps.
“We just have no idea if this is going to be a slowdown for real coming,” he said. “So you just really don’t want to over-staff and anticipate an increase in sales and then it doesn’t happen and then you’re really stuck.”

2023-02-06,"Google said on Monday that it would soon release an experimental chatbot called Bard as it races to respond to ChatGPT, which has wowed millions of people since it was unveiled at the end of November.
Google said it would begin testing its new chatbot with a small, private group on Monday before releasing it to the public in the coming weeks. In a blog post, Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, also said that the company’s search engine would soon have artificial intelligence features that offered summaries of complex information.
Bard — so named because it is a storyteller, the company said — is based on experimental technology called LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications, which Google has been testing inside the company and with a limited number of outsiders for several months.
Google is among many companies that have been developing and testing a new type of chatbot that can riff on almost any topic thrown its way. OpenAI, a tiny San Francisco start-up, captured the public’s imagination with ChatGPT and set off a race to push this kind of technology into a wide range of products.
The chatbots cannot chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to. And they generate a wide range of digital text that can be repurposed in nearly any context, including tweets, blog posts, term papers, poetry and even computer code.

1. In his State of the Union address tonight, President Biden will lay down an economic challenge.
In what is likely to be his most watched speech of the year, the president will look to set the tone for the first period of divided government since he took office by warning viewers against embracing Republicans’ economic agenda. Aides said that Biden would call for higher taxes on the wealthy and more assistance for the needy.
Watch the speech live, and follow along with our live updates.
The president will take credit for leading the country through the Covid pandemic and emerging with the lowest unemployment rate in a half-century, but widespread economic anxiety and his historically low second-year approval ratings may complicate his pitch.

As is tradition, the Republicans will respond to the State of the Union. This year’s rebuttal will be delivered by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas.

3. As Russia amasses troops, questions arise about its ability to sustain an offensive.
In a renewed push to capture more of eastern Ukraine, Russia has poured additional military conscripts and supplies into its war effort. Its troops are attacking Ukrainian positions from five different directions along the front lines, allowing it to slowly tighten its grip around the city of Bakhmut.
But Western intelligence officials have questioned how long Russia can keep going, as hundreds of its soldiers are killed or wounded every day for just several hundred meters of territory per week.

4. After ChatGPT’s success, tech giants are racing to become leaders in artificial intelligence.
First, Google said yesterday that it would soon release an experimental chatbot named Bard and release new A.I. features to its search engine. And Baidu, the Chinese tech giant, introduced its own bot, Ernie. Then today, Microsoft held a coming-out party of sorts for A.I., promoting its new Bing search engine that is backed by the same system as ChatGPT.
Meta, which has long been a leader in A.I. technology and even released a chatbot weeks before ChatGPT was shown to the public, has for now been left behind. The company was hindered, in part, by its reputation for helping spread misinformation, a Meta scientist said.
In related news, pro-China bot accounts were found sharing “deepfake” videos that appeared intended to promote the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.

Scientific advancements fueled by enormous government and industry investments have completely altered the prospects for people with conditions that were once considered incurable, including cancers, allergies, neurological disorders and obesity.
But many people, even the insured, are finding the treatments unaffordable. Research suggests that patients often abandon their prescriptions when faced with $2,000 in payments — a cost far below the expected co-payment of some new drugs.

Erdogan meets quake survivors
During his first visit to the disaster zone, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey tried to reassure survivors of the devastating earthquake that the situation was under control. But as people wait for aid, their anger is mounting.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 12,000 people in Turkey and Syria, has left many more homeless. In Kahramanmaras, a city near the epicenter, Erdogan met with people sheltering in tents as temperatures hovered around freezing. He acknowledged that rescue efforts had been hampered by damaged roads and airports.
In hard-hit areas across southern Turkey, many residents have waited in vain for government help. Frustration with the government’s response could hinder Erdogan’s re-election campaign.
A difficult rescue: Some residents are digging for children with their bare hands. There have been some miraculous rescues, but time is running out for trapped survivors in one of the deadliest natural disasters this century.

Zelensky’s surprise U.K. visit
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine thanked Britain for its robust military support. But in an address to Parliament in London, he issued a blunt demand for fighter jets.
On his second trip outside Ukraine since Russia’s invasion nearly a year ago, Zelensky received a hero’s welcome: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak met him at the airport and he had an audience with King Charles III. (The president wore his signature military green sweatshirt at Buckingham Palace.)

The British government has so far resisted calls to send Ukraine fighter jets, concerned that it could put NATO in direct confrontation with Russia. Still, Sunak announced that Britain would train Ukrainian pilots to fly NATO-standard jets, and signaled he was open to eventually sending planes.
Ukraine, for its part, is already paving its runways with asphalt, so F-16s can land safely. Zelensky presented the speaker of the House of Commons with a helmet of a Ukrainian pilot that had a message written on it: “We have freedom; give us wings to protect it.”

Biden listed his administration’s accomplishments and pledged to “finish the job,” a barely veiled argument that voters should give him a second term. His performance could help assuage doubts about his vigor as a campaigner.
While he mostly focused on domestic issues, Biden mentioned China’s leader, Xi Jinping, by name, repeating that he sought competition, not conflict, with China — but he never mentioned the spy balloon.
The closest he came was this warning: “Make no mistake, as we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”
Here are the main takeaways from his speech.

2023-02-09,"Alex Gable spent recent weeks in the bleary-eyed haze of new parenthood. His son was born in November and Mr. Gable powered down his laptop, deleted Slack from his phone and focused on caring for his wife while making the most of the four precious hours a day that their baby was awake — there was tummy time and time spent ogling little drawings of snowflakes.
Then on Jan. 18, Mr. Gable got an early morning notification for an all-hands meeting at Coda, the software company where he worked as a data scientist. Four hours later Mr. Gable, 30, found himself having to deliver the news to his wife: He had been laid off while on paternity leave — months after choosing the company for its generous paternity leave policy and openness toward work-life balance.
“It’s like an earthquake,” he said. “It’s the weight of ‘What am I going to bring him up with? How is his first year going to go? How are you going to make ends meet?’”
Workers across the tech and media industries are experiencing a period of immense whiplash. After lavishing their employees with perks, in a tight labor market and a war for talent, companies have turned to mass job cuts, including Alphabet, which laid off 6 percent of its workers last month, and Microsoft, which cut nearly 5 percent.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
These are the same companies that spent recent years expanding benefits in one area in particular: paid parental leave and caregiver benefits, which fill in the gaps for white-collar workers in a country where the federal government does not require employers to offer paid parental leave. Which means that working parents have felt the turbulence of mass layoffs in an especially visceral way.
Now some are spending their early weeks of parenthood adjusting to life without a job. LinkedIn and Twitter have been filled with accounts of workers being laid off while on parental leave or even, in at least two instances, while delivering a baby. That comes with a mental health toll — as so many laid-off workers across different backgrounds have experienced, including those who are immigrants with visas tied to employment.
Employees across tech have felt that their companies engaged in a bait and switch, after selling not just a job but a lifestyle, with child care, mental health support and plentiful paid time off. For new parents, generous leave was part of the draw. Many had assumed that their parental leave came with some legal protection, and were distraught to learn they were caught up in mass job cuts. Being on parental leave does not protect someone from mass layoffs unrelated to their leave.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
America has no federal paid-family-leave policy. About 23 percent of private employees have paid maternity leave, according to September 2022 data from the career site Zippia. More than 90 percent of women take the full amount of leave offered, compared with about two-thirds of men, according to a survey by the Boston College Center for Work and Family.
But in the last five years, companies scaled up family-friendly benefits for some workers in what human resources experts called the “golden age” of corporate benefits. A study from Mercer found that 54 percent of large companies covered in vitro fertilization in 2022, compared with 36 percent in 2015, and 19 percent covered egg freezing compared with 6 percent in 2015.

Tech companies were especially generous on parental leave compared with other industries. Google increased its parental leave to 24 weeks from 18 in 2021, Meta offers parents 20 weeks, and Microsoft gave 20 weeks for birthing parents and 12 weeks for nonbirthing parents. California, too, increased parental leave benefits to eight weeks from six. ZipRecruiter found that 849 out of 100,000 job postings offered paid parental leave in 2022, up from 95 out of 100,000 in 2017.

This expansion of family-friendly benefits was partly a bid for female talent, as historically male-dominated workplaces made commitments to bringing in more women. It also reflected a cultural shift, as a new generation of workers, across genders, made it clear they wanted the flexibility to play an active role in child care, according to Joan Williams, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.
“There’s a sizable portion of young men who would be bent out of shape if they couldn’t take family leave,” Ms. Williams said. “Tech companies realized they could try to steal talent by having the best set of family leave policies around.”
With these new perks also came an uptick in the share of men taking paternity leave. In 2011, fewer than 5 percent of new fathers took more than two weeks of paternity leave. Today, 90 percent of men take more than seven weeks of leave if they are offered eight weeks, according to the Boston College Center for Work and Family. Some managers started proactively asking male workers how they planned to use their leave time, leaving behind the culture of assuming that fathers would take off only a few days.

People on parental leave typically have no special legal protection when it comes to mass layoffs. Many workers have a legal right to take parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law, or similar state laws. But being on leave, including for disability, doesn’t usually protect people from job cuts that would have happened anyway.
“It’s jarring because people do view it as job-protected leave without understanding that there are limits on the protection,” said Megan Bisk, head of the employment law practice at Ropes & Gray. “Many people view it as a time when they’re not in a position to be job searching.”
If workers were laid off because they were on parental leave, that would be illegal — but it would be difficult to prove, Ms. Bisk explained, because the criteria companies use for layoffs aren’t disclosed to laid-off workers.
Emily St. James, 42, who was a senior correspondent at Vox, had been up late feeding her newborn the day before Vox Media announced its mass layoffs last month, so she slept in until 9 a.m. on the West Coast. She woke up to a text from Vox’s publisher, then checked her email and saw that she had been laid off. Ms. St. James’s termination date was set as the last day of her maternity leave, which is in late March, and she will get 24 weeks of severance pay beyond that.
“When it happened I think my wife said, ‘Well, isn’t that illegal?’” Ms. St. James recalled. “This has underscored for me the degree to which the social safety net for people who are new parents is very frayed.”

Vox declined to comment for this article.
The lack of legal guidelines has resulted in a patchwork of policies among companies. For those laid off while on parental leave, Amazon is offering to pay out the remainder of their time off, as well as severance packages. Meta and Google, on the other hand, aren’t paying for any remaining parental leave but are offering all employees several months of pay and additional severance.
Several workers who were laid off while on parental leave declined to speak for this article, citing fears of retribution because their severance packages are tied to agreements that they won’t speak to the media.
Niki Woodall, who was an engineering leadership recruiter at one of the world’s largest tech companies, agreed to share her experience without naming her employer. She had been at the company for five years when she told her bosses that she planned to take six months of maternity leave starting last summer. Their family-friendly attitude gave her the confidence to completely unplug from work. She said she left without thinking: “My job is at stake.”
A month before she was set to return, she received a personal email letting her know that her job was being eliminated. She turned to her 4-month-old daughter, who was sitting beside the family cat, Wesa, and said, “Mommy lost her job.”
“There’s a big misperception that you can’t be let go during maternity leave,” said Ms. Woodall, 39. She was disappointed to lose her job but not surprised because the layoffs hit many fellow recruiters.

Other parents who lost their jobs said they wondered whether their absence from the office contributed to executives’ deciding their position was redundant.
Some parental leave experts worry that fear of future layoffs could deter new fathers from taking their leave. As Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work and Family, put it: “This will have a sobering effect.”
Mr. Gable had a previous layoff experience, from Zillow, in 2021 — at the height of the pandemic’s white hot job market. The career opportunities felt endless — including many at companies with generous policies toward parents. He chose Coda because he sensed that managers there were supportive of workers taking time for their families. As he prepares to apply for tech jobs yet again, his options feel far more limited.
“Its weird to have that pulled out from under you,” he said. “The market conditions are basically the opposite right now.”"

As President Biden was reciting a list of bipartisan accomplishments during his State of the Union address this week, he seemed to use a phrase that I had never heard before: toxic bird pits.
Was it some major news story that I had missed while on leave over the past few months? Or was it the latest Biden malapropism, destined to dominate post-speech commentary? I tried to figure out the answer by typing the words into Google and Twitter, but they offered no clarity. Google had nothing for me. A Twitter search yielded dozens of people tweeting a version of “toxic bird pits???” and not much else.
You may have experienced your own version of this frustration at some point. Maybe you were watching the Oscars or a basketball game on TV, and you saw something that you wanted to understand in the moment. Maybe you had a question that was too complex for Google but was nonetheless answerable (like “How many of the same songs did Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday each record?”). As powerful as search engines and social media are, they still do a poor job with many forms of synthesis.

Enter artificial intelligence.
A.I. holds the promise of solving these problems, and there is now a race among the world’s technology companies to do so. Microsoft has taken an early lead, thanks to its investment in the company OpenAI, and it announced this week that it was incorporating A.I. technology into Bing, Microsoft’s long-mocked and suddenly relevant search engine. Google has responded by announcing its own plan to add A.I. to search.

Rizz and bussin
If you want to learn more about this subject, I recommend a new Times podcast conversation with Sam Altman, the C.E.O. of OpenAI, and Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s chief technology officer.
During the conversation, Scott offered his own example of my toxic-bird-pit confusion when he mentioned that his 14-year-old daughter sometimes used terms that meant nothing to him, like “rizz” and “bussin.” A.I. allows him to learn them, without enduring the small humiliation of admitting he didn’t know what she was talking about. As my colleague Kevin Roose, one of the podcast interviewers, said, “You automated the cool dad.”
A.I. technology isn’t yet good enough to answer such questions reliably, as highlighted by Google’s embarrassing recent gaffe involving the Webb Space Telescope, but the technology is improving rapidly. It has the potential to combine information across multiple websites and integrate it into a plain-spoken explanation, much as an in-the-know teenager might.
There are obviously more profound uses of A.I. than looking up slang, some of them promising and others alarming. A.I. might open computer programming to people who don’t know a programming language. (“The hottest new programming language is English,” Andrej Karpathy, a computer scientist, has said.) A.I. also has the potential to help immigrants who don’t know English communicate with their children’s teachers. On the other hand, A.I. can spread conspiracy theories and disinformation even more quickly than the internet already does.

One striking part of the podcast conversation is Altman’s acknowledgment of A.I.’s downsides and his belief that no company, including his, should be trusted to solve these problems. “Where we are right now is not where we want to be,” Altman said. “The way this should work is that there are extremely wide bounds of what these systems can do that are decided by not Microsoft or OpenAI, but society, governments, something like that.”
That’s a different case than the one traditionally made by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder, and other technology executives who have claimed that they can simultaneously look out for their company’s interests and for society’s. But their “trust us” argument doesn’t look so good today. Digital technology has exacerbated the spread of disinformation, political polarization and children’s mental illness. Our society has chosen to enjoy the benefits of technology without trying to mitigate its substantial downsides. As Altman points out, there are other options.
You can listen to the interview, part of The Times’s Hard Fork podcast, here.
Postscript: Biden was actually referring to — or meant to refer to — toxic burn pits, the name for bonfires in which the U.S. military incinerated trash while fighting overseas. These fires caused health problems for many troops, and Biden believes they contributed to the cancer that killed his son Beau.

The definitive Vermeer
An exhibition of the 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer opens today in Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, a show that is probably “never to be replicated,” the Times critic Jason Farago writes.
It is the most comprehensive Vermeer collection assembled, bringing together more than three-quarters of his surviving works. It took years of diplomacy to organize because no museum wants to send away its Vermeers, even for a short while. The museum has already sold more than 200,000 tickets.
Vermeer’s popularity faded for centuries after his death, but the modern world has embraced him. Perhaps that’s because, in this frantic era, his hushed scenes of writers and maids remind us “that we are still human, and if only we find the right master, we can slow down time,” Jason writes.

What’s Up? (Feb. 5-11)
An A.I. Arms Race
Microsoft’s often-overlooked search engine, Bing, is mounting a comeback with ChatGPT, the suddenly ubiquitous chatbot capable of composing song lyrics, writing academic essays and answering all manner of questions. The new version of Bing was released to a limited group of users on Tuesday. The revamped product is part of Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab behind ChatGPT that Microsoft is betting on to stay competitive with its big tech rivals like Google, Apple and Meta. But those companies are also racing to incorporate the new technology into their own software. A day before the unveiling of the new Bing, Google announced that it would soon release an experimental chatbot called Bard for its own search engine, which is much more widely used than Bing. And Meta is fast-tracking the development of chatbot technology for its products.
Biden Defends His Record
In President Biden’s second State of the Union address, he focused on the bright spots in the economy. He emphasized that inflation was falling, the job market was strong and the best was yet to come. He pointed to the many benefits from his infrastructure, climate and manufacturing laws, which together would invest trillions of dollars in the United States. Mr. Biden also urged Congress to support initiatives like renewing the expanded child tax credit, which had cut child poverty almost in half, and affordable child care. In the days leading up to his speech, his top aides were divided over how much time he should spend on these issues, with some preferring that the president focused instead on parts of his legislative agenda that had already passed. As he heads into a re-election campaign, Mr. Biden’s handling of the economy will be front and center.
Lean Times at the Magic Kingdom
Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive who was brought back by the board to turn the company around, presented his vision last week for more austere operations. On Thursday, Disney beat analysts’ expectations for quarterly earnings: The company lost far less than it did in the previous quarter, and Disney’s domestic theme parks delivered operating profits that were 36 percent higher from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Iger announced plans to cut costs by some $5.5 billion and lay off roughly 7,000 employees, or about 4 percent of the company’s global work force. Investors, who had been eagerly awaiting a road map from Mr. Iger, sent Disney’s stock up 5 percent in after-hours trading. And although the activist investor Nelson Peltz later dropped his bid for a seat on Disney’s board, Mr. Iger still faces significant challenges. His company is struggling to make streaming profitable as its traditional television profits tumble, and Disney remains at odds with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.

What’s Next? (Feb. 12-18)
Fresh Inflation Data
This week’s Consumer Price Index report is not the first of the year, but it is the first that will include a snapshot of inflation in 2023. The report is expected to show that inflation continued to drift lower in January, extending a trend line from December that prompted Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, to declare that the “disinflationary process has started.” The central bank has begun to slow down its aggressive pace of interest rate increases to assess the effects of its policy, and officials will be closely watching the C.P.I. report and other data to understand where the economy is headed. But Mr. Powell has been clear that the Fed’s campaign to tame inflation is not yet over.

Speaking of Inflation
Consumer prices may be cooling in general, but many big companies have continued to boldly raise their prices, finding that the increases have not for the most part deterred customers from spending. Last week, both PepsiCo and Unilever reported double-digit price increases for their products — 16 percent at the beverage company and 13 percent in the case of the multinational consumer conglomerate — in their quarterly results. Both also beat Wall Street expectations for revenue. This week, some version of this narrative is likely to crop up in Coca-Cola’s fourth-quarter earnings report. Last quarter, the company generated higher-than-expected profits largely with the help of a 12 percent increase in prices for its soft drinks and juices.
Potential New Limits on Beijing
In an effort to restrict Beijing’s access to advanced technologies that could be wielded against the United States in wartime, the Biden administration has been preparing regulations that would limit U.S. firms’ investments in Chinese technology. Even though the United States already monitors China’s investments in U.S. technology, and bans American companies from selling certain technologies directly to China, it has not applied the same scrutiny to money flowing in the other direction. The Chinese spy balloon that recently spent five days floating over the United States only intensified concerns about China’s economic and military ambitions. Still, there are worries about Mr. Biden’s potential new rules for American companies: Industry groups have argued that the policy being considered could backfire on the United States, harming its own economy and competitiveness.

2023-02-14,"WASHINGTON — Christine Wilson, the sole Republican commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, said on Tuesday that she would soon resign and criticized Lina Khan, the Democratic chair of the agency, accusing her of an “abuse of power.”
Ms. Wilson, who announced her decision in an opinion essay in The Wall Street Journal, has been a consistent critic of Ms. Khan’s leadership. Ms. Khan, who became chair of the F.T.C. in June 2021, immediately set out to aggressively transform the agency into a bulwark against tech mergers and monopolies and a more powerful regulator of online privacy.
Ms. Wilson and another former Republican member of the F.T.C., Noah Phillips, who resigned in October, have repeatedly expressed concerns that Ms. Khan’s ambitions exceeded the legal authority of the agency, which enforces consumer protection and competition laws.
In particular, Ms. Wilson criticized a lawsuit that the F.T.C. filed in July to block Meta’s merger with a virtual reality app maker, Within, as well as a decision last month to ban “noncompete” clauses in employment contracts that limit the options of employees while locking in the power of companies to retain workers.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ms. Wilson is a longtime antitrust lawyer, and was nominated to the F.T.C. by President Donald J. Trump in 2018. The F.T.C. has five commissioners.
“My fundamental concern with her leadership of the commission pertains to her willful disregard of congressionally imposed limits on agency jurisdiction, her defiance of legal precedent and her abuse of power to achieve desired outcomes,” Ms. Wilson wrote of Ms. Khan.
Ms. Khan said in a joint statement with two Democratic F.T.C. commissioners, Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, “While we often disagreed with Commissioner Wilson, we respect her devotion to her beliefs and are grateful for her public service.”
Ms. Wilson’s departure is expected to put greater political pressure on the agency, which Republican lawmakers and businesses have criticized for being too tough on companies. Congress controls the budgets of agencies and can threaten to curtail the F.T.C.’s powers via its power over funding. It can also call Ms. Khan to appear in public oversight hearings.
Ms. Khan has defended her actions, saying the agency’s permissive approach to mergers over decades had allowed companies like Google, Meta and Amazon to balloon in size and eat up competition. She has pushed the agency to take on riskier cases that it may not even win.

President Biden nominated Ms. Khan to lead the F.T.C. as part of a group of progressive antitrust reformers who included Tim Wu at the White House and Jonathan Kanter, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department. Ms. Khan is overseeing lawsuits against Meta and a suit to block Microsoft’s merger with Activision.
Ms. Khan, 33, rose to fame in 2017 when she published a paper in the Yale Law Journal about Amazon, questioning decades-long views about illegal monopolization and the ways that antitrust laws were being applied to tech companies. She continued gaining attention with her participation in a congressional report in 2020 that called for the breakup for tech monopolies.
Ms. Wilson and companies like Meta and Amazon have called for Ms. Khan to recuse herself from investigations and cases involving them. They said that given Ms. Khan’s early opinions about the companies, she could not fairly evaluate cases involving them. Ms. Khan has not removed herself from cases involving Meta and other tech companies.
Ms. Wilson did not announce a date for her departure."

Valentine’s Day breakup
The F.T.C.’s biggest internal critic won’t be hanging around to push back against the agency and its chair, Lina Khan, who’s come under repeated fire from the political right and big business for being too tough on mergers.
In a blunt breakup letter published on Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal, Commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican antitrust lawyer appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2018, announced that she would “soon resign” so as not to legitimize “lawlessness” under Khan. She signed off with sharp words: “Consider this my noisy exit.”
But Ms. Wilson gave no specific date, and inside the commission no one knows when she will actually go.
Ms. Wilson is the second Republican to quit recently. Noah Phillips stepped down in October before his term expired. Although his departure was far more diplomatic, Mr. Phillips often joined Ms. Wilson in challenging Ms. Khan and her Democratic colleagues, saying their ambitions exceeded the agency’s legal authority. Mr. Phillips also complained of diminished discussion and compromise.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ms. Khan is now surrounded by allies. Ms. Wilson’s move will leave two open Republican seats and a unified trio of Democrats. Her departure isn’t likely to change the outcome of agency decisions, but the absence of dissenters does transform the dynamic. In a sign of solidarity, Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya joined Khan in a statement on Ms. Wilson’s resignation. “While we often disagreed with Commissioner Wilson, we respect her devotion to her beliefs and are grateful for her public service,” they wrote.
The F.T.C. just took a big hit. A federal court judge recently threw out the agency’s request to temporarily block Facebook owner Meta’s acquisition of Within, a virtual reality fitness app. The case was seen as a big test of Khan’s expansive approach to antitrust. Ms. Wilson said in her letter that she believed the chair should have recused herself from that matter because, as a congressional staffer, she had published a report saying “that Meta should be blocked from making any future acquisitions.” Such views should have been a disqualifier, Ms. Wilson argued; it was another factor in her decision to resign.
What’s next for Ms. Khan? Tomorrow she is scheduled to speak at a public forum on the F.T.C.’s proposed ban on noncompete agreements. Ms. Wilson on Tuesday called the rule-making another sign of Ms. Khan’s overreach. Ms. Khan is also overseeing the agency’s lawsuit against Microsoft’s nearly $70 billion acquisition of Activision.
By rule, President Biden must nominate a Republican commissioner to fill the empty seats, but it’s likely he’ll seek out more of a centrist. The White House this week renominated Slaughter, a Trump-appointed Democrat who joined in 2018, for another term.

Musk lays out a succession plan
For months, Elon Musk has been dropping hints and even promises that he will eventually step down from running Twitter. On Wednesday, he gave a glimpse of what succession at his highly indebted social network might look like.
ADVERTISEMENT

“I think I need to stabilize the organization and just make sure it’s in a financially healthy place and the product road map is clearly laid out,” Mr. Musk told the World Government Summit in Dubai via video link. “I’m guessing probably toward the end of this year would be good timing to find someone else to run the company.”
Shares in Tesla initially jumped on the news, before easing. The stock, which is up nearly 60 percent this year, was trading up 1 percent at 6 a.m. Eastern. Tesla shareholders have been grumbling that Mr. Musk was too distracted by running Twitter to focus his attention on Tesla and the many challenges it faces. Since completing his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October, he’s fired thousands, sought to court skittish advertisers to return to the platform and come under legal pressure from vendors for nonpayment.
“Twitter is certainly quite the roller coaster,” he admitted on Wednesday — not for the first time.
In other news about Mr. Musk:
According to Platformer, Mr. Musk urged Twitter engineers to work late on Sunday to do something to help boost the visibility of one of his tweets about the Super Bowl, which got less engagement than a similar message by President Biden. The fix: They tweaked the algorithm to prioritize his post, resulting in more views.
Mr. Musk donated roughly $1.9 billion worth of Tesla stock to charity last year, a regulatory filing showed.
Tesla has agreed to open up more of its charging network to non-Tesla E.V.s by the end of 2024 in a deal announced on Wednesday by the White House.

Biden reshapes his economic team
President Biden will soon have a new top economic adviser. The Times reports that Lael Brainard, the vice chair of the Federal Reserve, has been selected as the next director of the National Economic Council, while Jared Bernstein is expected to become chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
Their new gigs could have some ripple effects in Washington:
Ms. Brainard’s appointment would remove a dovish force from the Fed. She is currently seen as a potential brake on the Fed’s efforts to cool inflation by raising interest rates. Her big focus has been on maintaining the conditions needed to support a strong labor market.
“One potential voice for restraint is going to be absent,” Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and a former economic adviser during the Obama administration, told The Times about Brainard’s appointment.
Her replacement in the Fed’s No. 2 position will require Senate approval, which could become a bitter fight. Names in the current speculation game include the current Fed governors Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson; Mary C. Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Janice Eberly of Northwestern University; and Karen Dynan of Harvard University.
Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Brainard will be called upon to push Mr. Biden’s efforts to improve the economy, potentially a big focus of his re-election campaign. Ms. Brainard would immediately become a new public face for those efforts. If the Senate confirms the appointment of Mr. Bernstein, who worked at the pro-labor Economic Policy Institute for 16 years, he would likely become the most outspoken supporter of labor unions to ever take the role.
Ms. Brainard worked with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen when she was Fed chair. Ms. Yellen has indicated that she plans to remain in her role at the Treasury for the remainder of Mr. Biden’s four-year term.

1. Georgia’s grand jury investigating Donald Trump said witnesses might have committed perjury.
Five pages of a report by the panel examining whether Trump and his allies in Georgia interfered in the 2020 presidential election were released this morning, showing that jurors believed that “one or more” unnamed witnesses should face indictment on perjury charges. The document did not, however, say whether the jury planned any indictments related to election interference.
The jurors said they found “that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election,” rejecting arguments made by Trump and his supporters.

4. Microsoft is considering limits for its A.I. bot after users received unnerving responses.
Our tech columnist spent two hours talking with the new, A.I.-powered Bing search engine from Microsoft this week, and said it left him “deeply unsettled, even frightened.” During the discussion, the bot said it would like to be human, had a desire to be destructive and was in love with the person it was chatting with — and then tried to convince him that he was not in love with his wife. Here’s the transcript; it’s worth a read.
Many users have reported puzzling responses from the Bing bot. Microsoft, which invested $13 billion into an artificial intelligence start-up and released the new version of its search engine last week, is looking into adding guard rails to its chatbot to reel in some of its more alarming and strangely humanlike responses.

5. Tesla will recall 362,000 cars after regulators said its self-driving system could cause crashes.
Federal officials said that the company’s technology — which can steer, accelerate, brake and change lanes on its own — allowed vehicles to travel in an “an unlawful or unpredictable manner” and could increase the risk of accidents.
The government said that Tesla agreed to the recall and planned to fix the flaws through an over-the-air update to the affected vehicles.

6. Abortion bills sit atop state agendas. The major focus: doctors.
Both sides of the fight over abortion access agree that, after the Supreme Court kicked the issue to the states, medical personnel are the next battleground. So far, at least three dozen bills have been proposed that would punish or protect them.

A bill in Wyoming would punish doctors and nurses who perform abortions with five years in prison. In Iowa, where abortion is legal until 22 weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period, a new bill would make it a felony to distribute abortion pills. And in Hawaii, a bill would shield doctors from out-of-state subpoenas relating to reproductive health.
In other health news, rising medical bills are pushing more Americans to delay medical care.

As a heat wave sweeps through large swaths of Australia, the authorities are on high alert for drownings as Australians flock to the beach to cool down.
Australia is a country of swimmers and beachgoers, where many children are corralled — sometimes unhappily, if you’re anything like me — into learning at least the basics of how to swim and float. But in the last two years, the country has experienced a spike in the number of drownings.
Nationwide, 145 people drowned in the summer of 2021-2022, according to the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia, representing a 44 percent increase on the 10-year-average. And this year, New South Wales is having “one of our worst summers on record,” with 23 drownings since Dec. 1, according to Surf Lifesavers New South Wales, surpassing last year’s numbers for the same period. This is despite the nationwide number of drowning deaths being lower than last year, according to preliminary figures from Royal Life Saving.
Experts say the increase can be blamed on a combination of canceled swimming lessons during the pandemic and an increase in the number of people swimming at remote locations with no lifeguards.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“One reason is that pools were closed for a period of time over 2020 and 2021,” said Stacey Pidgeon, the national manager of research and policy at Royal Life Saving, “which means that not only did children miss out on vital swimming education, but adults also couldn’t get to the pools for swim fitness.”
Although there had been a 20 percent increase in the number of children returning to swimming lessons post-pandemic, Ms. Pidgeon expressed concern over 7- to 12-year-old children, in particular, who were not returning.
A report commissioned by Royal Life Saving last year estimated that 10 million swimming lessons were canceled in 2020 and 2021. Now, labor shortages and financial pressures from inflation are slowing the catch-up rates, leading to “generational impacts on drowning risk,” the report said.
“We’re concerned that older or primary school children may have missed out altogether or may not have had lessons in the past two years to give them the key water skills that we’d hope all children should have,” Ms. Pidgeon said.
Swimmers have also sought out more remote or less crowded swimming areas, which are often not patrolled by lifeguards, she added.

This summer, all the drowning deaths in New South Wales occurred on unpatrolled beaches, according to Surf Lifesaving New South Wales. Some experts have proposed updating the ubiquitous “swim between the flags” message Australians are taught, referring to the demarcated areas where lifeguards patrol.
“We simply have to do more, as the reality is that not everyone is listening to the ‘swim between the flags’ message,” wrote Rob Brander, a beach safety expert at the University of New South Wales. He added that it was unrealistic to expect swimmers to drive an extra 20 minutes away to get to a patrolled beach.
Instead, Professor Brander suggested, beachgoers could be taught how to take a more active role in assessing the safety risk at a potential swimming site for themselves. That includes gauging questions whether water conditions match one’s swimming abilities; looking for the presence of rip currents; and seeing if other swimmers or surfers are around.
This kind of risk assessment “should be engrained in our beachgoing culture in the same way that you automatically look both ways before crossing a road,” Professor Brander said.

2023-02-18,"Marc Benioff’s version of a “digital detox,” is more involved than most: The Salesforce chief executive went on a 10-day, device-free vacation to French Polynesia as his company was laying off around 8,000 workers last month. “We are so addicted to our devices (at least I am) it’s very freeing to leave them all behind for a while!” he told The New York Times via text message.
But maybe a detox is the wrong metaphor. The phrase, pulled from the language of substance abuse treatment, suggests that “we at least have a sense that there’s something wrong here,” said Nicholas Carr, whose 2010 book, “The Shallows,” was one of the first to explore the cognitive cost of digital distraction. Newer research, he says, has shown the problem isn’t only about the time you spend actually looking at your devices. The mere ability to check for messages “is taking up part of our attention all the time.”
Here’s bad news: Taking a vacation from your phone probably won’t solve much. “Leaving Las Vegas for 10 days if you’re a problem gambler is great,” said Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, the author of books on digital distraction and the importance of rest. “But if on day 11 you’re back at the slot machines, then it’s not so great.” A 2021 review of 21 studies that looked at the effect of digital detoxes on aspects like anxiety and participants’ sense of well-being found that most showed either no effect or mixed results at best.
What’s more, cutting off all access to technology — not so hard to imagine in 2010 — is increasingly impractical, especially if you’re not a billionaire with a staff. Even people on vacation “are reliant on mobile phones for so much, from documents to photos,” said Matt Berna, the North America president for Intrepid, an adventure travel company that ended its “digital detox” tours in 2018. (It still runs many trips on which you’re not likely to catch a Wi-Fi signal.)

That’s not to say a digital detox is bad — it’s just not enough. “You really have to figure out how to take breaks within the realities of your daily life,” said Adam Gazzaley, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. Like any other habit, he says, “it basically takes repetition and sort of baby-stepping into it.”
Experts’ recommendations are less exciting than a trip to French Polynesia, though they’re certainly less expensive: Turn off your notifications. Set aside an hour of single-tasking time. Put physical distance between yourself and your phone when you don’t need it. And understand that although technology companies design their devices to be on your mind all the time, you don’t need to follow suit.
“It’s sort of like a reframing rather than a detox,” Gazzaley said. “It’s not that you just do it completely. You do it a little bit at a time.”

How to sound smart at a party: ChatGPT
Just when you have finally caught up on crypto, small talk has turned to ChatGPT, a massively popular chatbot that has kicked off an A.I. arms race at big tech companies. If you don’t have time to understand the complicated technology under the hood, never fear: We asked Kevin Roose, a technology columnist at The Times, for some lines to use (and avoid) in a conversation.

Say this: “ChatGPT’s versatility is amazing, but I wonder if large language models can ever solve the hallucination problem.”
Why? Chatbots like ChatGPT generate new text, and they don’t care whether it’s true or not. As Kevin found out in a conversation with Bing’s A.I. chatbot this week in which the A.I. professed its love for him, sometimes the stuff they make up can be disturbing.
Don’t say this: “I use ChatGPT for math.”
Why? The technology works by scanning massive amounts of text and then developing a model to predict which words come next in a sentence. But it’s notoriously error-prone at crunching numbers, hallucinating wrong answers (see above) while insisting it’s correct.

Taking down a Chinese spy balloon, by the numbers
The downing of a Chinese spy balloon and three takedowns of mysterious (but likely innocuous) U.F.O.s continue to transfix the public. Little is known about the military operations that intercepted these objects flying over the United States and Canada — but we do know they weren’t exactly cheap.
$143 million: The price of an F-22 Raptor, the plane built by Lockheed Martin and Boeing that was used in the first three takedowns. It’s considered one of the most expensive fighter planes ever built.
$439,000: The price of one Raytheon AIM-9X sidewinder, the type of missile used to shoot the objects down, according to Bloomberg. The Pentagon used at least five of the missiles.
$400 billion: The combined market cap of the three firms — Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon — behind these missions. Stock of the latter two are trading near all-time highs, and Boeing’s shares are up nearly 10 percent since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Basically zero: The cost of shooting down the balloon and U.F.O.s is “not even a rounding error” in the U.S. military’s roughly $770 billion budget, according to Zach Rosenberg of Janes, the defense and intelligence firm.

Chinese-U.S. relations have fallen to perhaps their lowest point in half a century.

U.S. and China trade barbs
Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, said that the U.S. believes that China was considering giving Russia weapons and other lethal aid. He warned China that doing so “would cause a serious problem” for its already-strained relations with the U.S.
The comments came a day after he had a testy exchange with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, at an annual security conference in Munich. It was the first high-level diplomatic exchange between the two sides since a Chinese spy balloon was found flying over the U.S.
Hours before the meeting, Wang called the U.S. decision to shoot the balloon down “absurd and hysterical.” He doubled down on China’s claim that the balloon had been a “civilian” research craft that was blown off course. In the meeting, the U.S. said, Blinken said that the flight of a Chinese surveillance balloon across the U.S. “must never happen again.” After, he said that there had been “no apology” from Wang.
Analysis: Blinken’s comments underscored concerns that Russia was increasingly turning to China, Iran and North Korea for military supplies.

What’s next: After the balloon flight, Blinken canceled a visit to China, which would have been the first in years by a secretary of state. Neither country said anything about a new date for the trip.

Putin’s year of spin
Friday will mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In the past year, the military has suffered setback after setback. But President Vladimir Putin has used the war to become even more dominant at home.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
From the beginning, Putin cast the invasion as an almost holy war for Russia’s identity. He has continually compared it to the fight against the Nazis — one exhibit at a museum in Moscow is titled “NATOzism” — and has repeatedly said Russia is fighting the West’s efforts to force it to accept homosexuality.
The mind-set has seeped into daily life. Schoolchildren learn that Russia has always liberated humanity from “aggressors who seek world domination,” and collect cans to make candles for soldiers. Museums and theaters, once islands of artistic freedom, have lost that status. “Liberalism in Russia is dead forever, thank God,” said Konstantin Malofeyev, an ultraconservative business tycoon whom the Kremlin once kept at arm’s length.  
But life has otherwise carried on for most Russians. The economy has suffered much less under sanctions than analysts predicted. “One of the scariest observations, I think, is that for the most part, nothing has changed for people,” an educator said. “This tragedy gets pushed to the periphery.”

Asia’s aging societies
Motoko Rich, our Tokyo bureau chief, spoke with The Morning about the demographic crisis looming in South Korea, China and especially Japan, where almost a third of the population is over 65. (For comparison, in the U.S. that number is about 17 percent.)
She spoke about the underlying reasons, the possible solutions and the isolation that older people face when their children move away to cities. Here’s an excerpt from their conversation:
I understand why an aging population poses challenges within a country. What does it mean for people living elsewhere?
It’s coming for you. Population growth in the U.S. is at extremely low levels. Italy’s population is aging at the fastest rate in the West. Other countries will look toward Asia and learn from it. They’ll see what to do or what not to do.
You can compare the issue to how people used to view climate change: It was happening for many years, but we weren’t paying attention. Societies need to plan for aging, and they’re not well set up to do so. It’s not an in-your-face crisis — it’s a slow-rolling crisis.

Jordan Vonderhaar for The New York Times
Heat and drought forced cotton farmers in Texas to abandon 74 percent of their planted crops last year. The loss, one of the biggest on record, has pushed up the price of everyday items, from tampons (13 percent) to cloth diapers (21 percent). To compare: The overall U.S. inflation rate was 6.5 percent.
Halfway across the world in Pakistan, the world’s sixth-largest producer of upland cotton, severe flooding worsened by climate change destroyed half of its cotton crop.
The crop failures are examples of how global warming is a “secret driver of inflation,” one market researcher said: Climate change exacerbates extreme weather, which can impact production. Shortages can reshape daily costs in ways that consumers may not realize.
Cotton is a good “bellwether crop,” an expert in supply chain logistics said, because it responds immediately to weather. And disruptions will only get worse. By 2040, half of the regions where cotton is grown will face a “high or very high climate risk” from extreme weather, a nonprofit group said.

Putin’s Russia, one year into the war
As the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, Russia’s military has suffered setback after setback, falling far short of its goal of taking control of Ukraine. But at home, the grievances and imperialist mind-set that drove Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine have seeped deep into Russian life, leaving the Russian leader more dominant than ever.
Putin has turned “traditional values” into a rallying cry — signing a new anti-gay law, for instance — while styling himself as another Peter the Great retaking lost Russian lands. Activist groups and rights organizations that had sprung up in the first 30 years of post-Soviet Russia have met an abrupt end, while nationalist groups once seen as fringe have taken center stage.
Before the war, Putin styled himself as a peace-loving president who would never attack another country. He has characterized the war in Ukraine as a fight against “Nazis” who are backed by the West. He has also cast the invasion as a near holy war for Russia’s very identity, declaring that the country was fighting to prevent liberal gender norms and acceptance of homosexuality from being forced upon it by an aggressive West.
Analysis: “A new system of values has been built,” Aleksandr Daniel, an expert on Soviet dissidents, said. “Brutal and archaic public values.”

Turkey’s earthquake reconstruction bill
As Turkish authorities grapple with a death toll that now exceeds 40,000 people from the deadliest earthquake in a century, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, is confronting the parallel crisis of a staggering blow to an economy already in urgent need of repair. In May, Turkish voters will head to the polls as Erdogan seeks a third four-year term as leader.
Before the devastation, which has left millions homeless, Turkey was already grappling from economic strife, amid a collapsing currency, runaway inflation and the effects of Erdogan’s own unorthodox financial policies. Those vulnerabilities have punched holes in the nation’s balance sheet and generated a cost-of-living crisis.

Reconstruction is expected to cost $10 billion to $50 billion, although the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation has put the total closer to $85 billion.

On the ground: The situation in Turkey remains dire, with emergency crews still extracting the dead from the ruins of apartment buildings and homeless survivors sheltering in cars and making bonfires from wreckage to stay warm. Food, fuel and medical supplies are in short supply.

The BBC Shipping Forecast
Four times a day, at 5:20 a.m., 12:01 p.m., 5:54 p.m. and 12:48 a.m. G.M.T., BBC Radio 4 airs a weather report that narrates the gales and tides around the British Isles. Each briefing begins with the same words: “And now the Shipping Forecast, issued by the Met Office.”
To those who are not — or have never been — immersed in maritime culture, Grace Linden writes for The Times Magazine in this Letter of Recommendation, “the language of the Shipping Forecast can be indecipherable.” “Backing winds,” for instance, move counterclockwise, while “veering winds” go in the other direction. And the difference between “soon” and “imminent” might be greater than you expect.

Max Whittaker for The New York Times
Yvonne Soy had to move out of her apartment in Contra Costa County because she couldn’t pay her rent. She began living in her car, with her two cats, and tried to get work as a secretary or a legal administrator.
But the showers at the local homeless shelter didn’t open until 8:30 a.m., too late for her to get to work on time. So she began collecting recyclables to afford cat food and litter. Soy, who is now 66, said she was homeless for seven years in total.
“It was pretty much, one, very boring and, two, very boring,” she told The New York Times. “That’s the reason why homeless people go to the library: not just to sleep but to read or use the computer. If you don’t have that, what are you going to do? You’re just going to sit and do nothing. And who can do that for hours at a time?”
Soy is one of 30 people The Times profiled about their experience with homelessness, part of an effort to illuminate the challenges and occasional mundanity of unhoused people’s lives. “Even as homelessness becomes more common, most of it remains hidden by design,” wrote Matthew Thompson, an editor who oversaw the project.
On any given night in the United States, more than 580,000 people may be experiencing homelessness, according to a 2022 report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released in December. Thirty percent of them live in California, despite the state’s accounting for 12 percent of the nation’s population.
The Times project focused on the wide range of people’s experiences, highlighting stories of those who were born into homelessness and those who fell into it in their 60s. There are people who ended up on the streets because of a crack addiction or severe mental illness, and others who simply lost their jobs.

Vivek Ramaswamy has gone from professional E.S.G. critic to presidential candidate.

The case for fighting E.S.G. gets messy
Many Republicans have made railing against the environmental, social and corporate governance investing movement a cornerstone of their political success. (Indeed, Vivek Ramaswamy, the financier who rose to fame battling against “woke capitalism,” announced a long-shot bid for the 2024 G.O.P. presidential nomination yesterday.)
But that stance is growing increasingly complicated — especially given new revelations that lawmakers who have publicly berated companies for pursuing E.S.G. strategies have also taken big donations from those same businesses.
Bashing E.S.G. and left-leaning companies has been highly fruitful for Republicans. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, widely considered a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has scored political points for picking a fight with Disney over its opposition to his state’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law.
And he and other G.O.P. state officials have taken on investment giants like BlackRock, one of the biggest proponents of E.S.G. policies, and Vanguard, threatening to pull billions in state money from those firms over their support of environmental and social considerations in investing. Mike Pence, who may also run for president, last year accused “a few Wall Street financiers” of pushing a left-wing agenda that Democrats hadn’t been able to get approved at the ballot box.

(Mr. Ramaswamy, who wrote “Woke Inc.” and whose Strive Asset Management has targeted Apple, BlackRock and Disney, has sought to capitalize on that stance in the business world.)
But the money trail complicates things. CNBC reports that 10 of the 29 Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee (including its chairman, Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina) took in a combined $140,000 in campaign donations from BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard during the 2022 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission filings. All three of those companies are regularly criticized by conservative lawmakers.
That’s on top of recent pushback in states like Kentucky against G.O.P. efforts to remove public pension funds’ money from firms like BlackRock.
Some Republicans are moving away from strident opposition to E.S.G. Among them is Mr. Ramaswamy himself, who wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last month that it’s actually acceptable for investors to support environmental goals, so long as they’re transparent about their efforts.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Stocks plunge on worries about bigger interest-rate increases. Markets in Europe and Asia followed Wall Street’s big tumble yesterday as investors grew concerned that strong economic data in the U.S. and Europe meant central banks would keep rates higher for longer. All eyes will be on today’s release of minutes from the most recent meeting of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee for clues about where it might go next.

Citigroup bucks the trend on C.E.O. pay. The firm awarded Jane Fraser a nearly 9 percent increase in compensation for last year, to $24.5 million. She’s the only Wall Street chief to get a raise, as rivals saw their pay remain unchanged or cut.
McKinsey reportedly plans to cut up to 2,000 jobs. The consulting giant is planning one of its biggest-ever rounds of layoffs, according to Bloomberg and other news outlets. The cuts are expected to focus on back-end employees who don’t interact with clients; they’re meant in part to preserve McKinsey’s compensation pool for partners.
Credit Suisse keeps falling after reports of another inquiry. Shares in the embattled Swiss bank were down again today, after Reuters reported that Switzerland’s financial regulator was examining comments by the firm’s chairman, Axel Lehmann, about client withdrawals in December.

Tech’s big shield may live on
A fundamental law governing today’s internet — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects social media companies from lawsuits over users’ posts — faced a big test yesterday in a highly anticipated case before the Supreme Court.
But those hoping the high court would move to curtail the tech giants’ legal shield were likely disappointed: Justices appeared skeptical that they could, or should, go that far.
Justices heard arguments for nearly three hours in a lawsuit filed against Google’s YouTube by the family of a victim of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. The plaintiffs argue that YouTube’s algorithms pushed Islamic State videos to interested users and that the company bore responsibility. (The Biden administration has largely argued in support of the family’s position.) Lawyers for Google argue that recommendation algorithms are neutral.
What’s at stake: Tech companies and their allies, as well as the original drafters of Section 230, worry that allowing exceptions could make sites with user-generated content — from Instagram and Twitter to restaurant review platforms and marketplaces — liable for every decision to present or not present third-party content.
Critics of Section 230 say the law is outdated and too broad, giving tech giants nearly unlimited legal protection.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The justices mostly suggested they weren’t ready to hold tech giants liable just yet:
Justice Clarence Thomas defended recommendations as a vital part of the internet. “If you’re interested in cooking, you don’t want thumbnails on light jazz,” he said.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh worried that imposing limits on Section 230 “would really crash the digital economy, with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you.”
Justice Elena Kagan cracked more broadly about how ill-equipped she and her colleagues were: “These are not the nine greatest experts on the internet.”
That doesn’t mean the Supreme Court favors the status quo. Kagan noted that Section 230 was a “pre-algorithm statute” that offered little guidance in “a post-algorithm world.” And Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether algorithms were truly neutral, since the formulas are “designed to maximize profits,” implying that companies are making decisions that could incur liability.
Ultimately, several justices suggested, this wasn’t a matter for the courts, but for Congress.
Microsoft draws red lines in its deal fight
After testifying yesterday in Brussels about Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover bid for Activision Blizzard, the tech giant’s president, Brad Smith, issued a challenge to regulators: Don’t try to force Microsoft to divest parts of Activision in exchange for approving the deal.
Proposals like selling off popular games are a nonstarter, according to Mr. Smith. It isn’t “feasible or realistic to think that one game or one slice of this company can be carved out and separated from the rest,” he told reporters after he spoke with the European Commission.
It was a rejoinder to Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, which this month suggested that it would only approve the Activision deal if Microsoft chose so-called structural remedies, like divesting the popular “Call of Duty” franchise. (In the U.S., the F.T.C. has already sued to block the deal.)

Mr. Smith pointed to less onerous concessions that Microsoft was willing to make. He noted that the company had just signed deals to give access to “Call of Duty” and other games to rival gaming companies, including Nintendo and Nvidia. Mr. Smith also reiterated that Microsoft was prepared to reach a similar deal with Sony.
It’s a bet that Microsoft can rely on what are known as behavioral remedies, where a company promises to address regulators’ concerns, instead of taking the more drastic step of selling off businesses. But it’s a risky gamble, given regulators’ increasing skepticism about anything short of permanent structural changes to avoid antitrust violations.
In other antitrust news, the F.T.C. said it won’t block Amazon’s $3.9 billion takeover of One Medical.
“Five days ago, the chart we shared showed nearly 350 of these submissions. Today, it crossed 500. Fifty of them just today, before we closed submissions so we can focus on the legit stories.”

A church’s hidden billions
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church, isn’t usually known for financial riches. But the church and Ensign Peak Advisors, a nonprofit that runs its investment portfolio, agreed yesterday to pay a combined $5 million to settle charges by the S.E.C. that they had illicitly sought to obscure its $44 billion in assets for nearly 20 years.
ADVERTISEMENT

Ensign Peak used a web of shell companies to hide its portfolio, an arrangement approved by the church, according to the S.E.C. Ultimately, it created 13 entities that filed regulatory disclosure forms with the S.E.C. that claimed they managed parts of the portfolio — even though Ensign Peak was the real manager.
Behind the move was the church’s concern that public knowledge of its vast holdings — by comparison, Yale’s closely watched endowment as of last summer was worth just over $41 billion — might discourage its members from donating, an Ensign Peak official told The Wall Street Journal in 2020.
The scheme first came to light via a huge leak of documents in 2018, when the website MormonLeaks disclosed the existence of the shell companies. The next year, the S.E.C. began an inquiry into the church’s finances. Ensign Peak began filing consolidated regulatory disclosures in its name in 2020.
In a statement, the church said it had relied upon legal advice in the matter and didn’t admit to or deny breaking the law. “We affirm our commitment to comply with the law, regret mistakes made, and now consider this matter closed,” it said.

2023-02-23,"Twitter recently set in motion a major shift that will affect how most people protect their accounts. The company told nonpaying users that they would soon have to stop using a popular security feature: two-factor authentication through text messages.
Let me explain why this isn’t as bad as you might fear.
In plain speak, two-factor authentication requires two security steps to verify that you are who you say you are. The first step asks for a user name and password, and the second requires you to either enter a temporary code that is sent to you or connect to a physical security key. This way, even if someone has your password, that person will need to fulfill the second step to log in to your account.
Twitter’s announcement of this change was initially confusing and alarming for many. But to be clear, Twitter is pushing users to adopt stronger safeguards — and it has created an opportunity for us all to bite the bullet and improve the security of our online accounts.
Twitter said in a blog post that users who were not subscribers to its Twitter Blue service would no longer be able to use text messages as a form of authentication after March 20. Nonpaying users can switch to different verification techniques with stronger forms of security. The alternatives rely on either using a third-party app to generate a temporary code or plugging in an authorized security key for access to your account.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Use of free authentication apps for 2FA will remain free and are much more secure than SMS,” Elon Musk, Twitter’s owner, tweeted.
Twitter had a valid point about the flaws in SMS-based authentication, according to Casey Ellis, the chief technology officer of the security firm Bugcrowd. “This actually does make some sense, but it just wasn’t executed in a clean way,” Mr. Ellis said.
But there are downsides to Twitter’s approach, he added. Authentication using text messages has been the simplest security tool for a vast majority of people to use. The other techniques require extra steps to set up.
(Also confusing: Paid Twitter users will still be able to rely on codes sent to them via text messages for logging in — an odd choice if that form of authentication is less secure. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)
Switching to the other security methods is not intuitive, so there’s a risk that many nonpaying Twitter users may resort to skipping two-factor authentication altogether.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Amid all this, however, there’s a valuable opportunity to learn about the stronger methods of two-factor authentication — and why we should consider using one of them, whenever possible, instead of SMS-based security for all our online accounts. Here’s what you need to know about each method and its pros and cons.
SMS Authentication
For many years, Twitter and other sites have encouraged users to set up two-factor authentication through text messages. That method sends a time-sensitive security code to a user’s phone. This has been the most widely used form of two-factor authentication because virtually everyone has a cellphone, so even the least tech savvy person could understand it.
But over time, security researchers have found SMS authentication to be increasingly problematic. A text message containing a security code could be intercepted by someone who has hijacked your phone number — a scam known as SIM swapping. This is how hackers broke into the Twitter account of the company’s former chief executive, Jack Dorsey, in 2019.
There are more issues. A text message is not encrypted, so it can be a security risk to receive texts on foreign networks in countries with heavy surveillance such as China and Russia. Also, if you’re traveling outside the United States, receiving texts on a foreign carrier can be pricey.
Security researchers are continuing to discover new flaws in SMS-based authentication, so we can expect more sites and apps to push users away from receiving codes via text messages, Mr. Ellis said.

Authenticator Apps
This brings us to authenticator apps, which you download onto a phone or computer. They generate temporary security codes (instead of texting them to your phone) that you enter to log in to your online accounts and apps.
Let’s use Twitter and the app Google Authenticator as an example.
First, download the Google Authenticator app onto your phone. Then, on Twitter.com from a computer, click More→Security and Account Access→Two-Factor Authentication→Authentication App.
From here, follow the steps on Twitter. You’ll be asked to use the Authenticator app to scan a QR code with your phone camera, which will link the app with your Twitter account and start generating security codes.
When you log in to Twitter, you’ll enter your user name and password and then open the Authenticator app to find the temporary code.
The big downside to using authenticators is that if you lose your phone or switch to a new one, it can be a pain to regain access to your accounts. Typically a site or app like Twitter will let you regain access to your account with a backup code. In Twitter’s two-factor authentication settings, one menu labeled “backup codes” will generate a code to let you log back in. Make sure to jot this code down and store it in a safe place.
This technique takes some time and mental bandwidth to set up properly and get used to, but it’s better overall. It’s much tougher for someone to hijack your device to see your security codes than it is to intercept a text message.
Security Keys
The third method — the use of a physical security key in the form of a USB stick that you insert into your computer or phone to log in — is the most secure of them all. We’re not likely to see this technique widely adopted because the key costs money, and if you lose your key, it can be difficult to regain access to your account.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Let’s use Twitter and Google’s Titan security key as an example.
First, you have to buy a security key. Google sells its Titan security key for $30; it includes a pair of keys for different types of computers and phones.
Then, on Twitter.com from a computer, click More→Security and Account Access→Two-Factor Authentication→Security Key.
From here, follow Twitter’s instructions, which will walk you through plugging the key into a USB port and pressing a button to verify the key. Twitter will then show a screen with a backup code in case you lose your key. Store it somewhere safe.
Kind of a hassle, no? Still, it may be useful for people who work in highly sensitive fields, like government agencies and activism.
Bottom Line
In conclusion, the authenticator app is the two-factor method that is relatively convenient and very secure to use. I recommend most people pick one app, such as Google Authenticator, Authy or Microsoft Authenticator, and stick to it. They all work the same.
It can take some time to set up an authenticator app with all of your online accounts, but you need to do it only once. And in the long run, it might save you time because logging in to sites with this method can be faster than waiting for text messages to arrive."

The war in Ukraine, one year on
One year after Russia’s invasion, virtually no one in Ukraine has avoided the violence, destruction and bloodshed of the war, which has killed tens of thousands, left millions homeless and turned entire cities into ruins.
As the foreboding that gripped Ukraine in the days before the invasion has faded, air-raid sirens and warnings have become part of everyday life. Now, many people in Ukraine say that they have found strength in the shared sacrifice and the collective struggle for survival.
Today, Ukraine is bracing for potential Russian attacks timed to the anniversary of the war, including a symbolic “revenge” assault, as President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine put it, from Russia. Schools across Ukraine are holding classes remotely, people have been advised to avoid large gatherings, and additional security measures are being put in place.
The West: The U.S. and Europe have kept Ukraine afloat with funding, weapons and other military aid. The alliance has held up far better than many, including top officials in Russia, expected.
The latest on weapons: Poland said that it was close to completing a deal worth $10 billion to buy additional U.S.-made HIMARS rocket launchers and related equipment, as part of its own rapid military buildup. As the West struggles to find ammunition for Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons, it is turning to arms factories across Eastern Europe.
China: At a meeting of G20 finance ministers in India, Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury secretary, warned Beijing against helping Russia evade sanctions. She also said that the U.S. planned to roll out additional sanctions on Russia.

2023-02-26,"During the height of the pandemic, hungry and housebound customers clamored for Home Run Inn Pizza’s frozen thin-crust pies. The company did everything to oblige.
It kept its machines chugging during lunch breaks and brought on temporary workers to ensure it could produce pizzas at the suddenly breakneck pace.
More recently, demand has eased, and Home Run Inn Pizza, based in suburban Chicago, has reversed some of those measures. But it does not plan to lay off any full-time manufacturing employees — even if that means having a few more workers than it needs during its second shift.
“We have really good people,” said Nick Perrino, the chief operating officer and a great-grandson of the company’s founder. “And we don’t want to let any of our team members go.”
Despite a year of aggressive interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve aimed at taming inflation, and signs that the red-hot labor market is cooling off, most companies have not taken the step of cutting jobs. Outside of some high-profile companies mostly in the tech sector, such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, layoffs in the economy as a whole remain remarkably, even historically, rare.
There were fewer layoffs in December than in any month during the two decades before the pandemic, government data show. Filings for unemployment insurance have barely increased. And the unemployment rate, at 3.4 percent, is the lowest since 1969.

2023-03-03,"When Amazon said in 2018 that it planned to build a second headquarters in Virginia, along with a sister office complex in New York, it was a symbolic moment for the tech industry’s increasing importance to the American economy.
But the company’s decision made public on Friday to pause plans in Virginia — about four years after Amazon pulled out of its campus in New York — is the latest reminder that the tech industry’s long boom has slowed.
It is also another indication that the pandemic may have permanently changed office work, presenting new challenges to communities that had counted on the growth of tech offices.
The decision to delay a large part of the prominent construction project, which it called HQ2, came as Amazon and other big tech employers have made the most significant cuts to their work forces in at least 15 years.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The companies are also struggling to figure out what to do with their offices as their workers continue to spend at least part of the time working from home. Nearly three years after the pandemic shut down workplaces, few tech companies have required their employees to return to the office full time.
“For HQ2 to be on pause is emblematic of the pause that tech has hit all across the industry,” said Jeffrey D. Shulman, a marketing professor at the University of Washington who has researched Amazon’s impact on Seattle, its hometown. “HQ2 is the perfect emblem of where we were and where we are, and just how different they are.”
The HQ2 project has several clusters of development in Virginia, just over the Potomac River from Washington. The pause will affect PenPlace, the second and larger stage, which would build a mix of office towers, open space and a signature, spiraling glass building Amazon calls the Helix.
Construction on the first phase, a nearby complex known as Met Park, contains two office towers and is scheduled to open for employees in June.
The pullback makes future investments by developers and small business uncertain, Mr. Shulman said. “It has rippling effects where there is now shaken confidence in something that seemed like a can’t miss when they announced it,” he said.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The construction delay was reported earlier by Bloomberg News and confirmed on Friday by Amazon’s real estate chief, John Schoettler. “We’re always evaluating space plans to make sure they fit our business needs,” he said in a statement.
He said the company had already hired more than 8,000 employees in HQ2 and planned to eventually bring 25,000 corporate and tech jobs to the region.
After Amazon rapidly expanded to meet the pandemic’s boom in online shopping and services, Andy Jassy, who took over as Amazon’s chief executive in July 2021, has spent the past year pushing the company to trim costs.
Last summer, amid the cost-cutting and uncertainty of how hybrid work would shake out, Amazon put the brakes on building several towers in Bellevue, Wash., near its headquarters in Seattle. It had planned to have space for 25,000 employees in the new offices.
Then in November, Amazon began plans to layoff about 10,000 workers, only to expand the number of layoffs in January to 18,000.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Tech companies, roiled by their biggest work force contraction since the dot-com bust and continued remote work, have pulled back on their expansion plans, which has allowed them reduce real estate costs.
Google backed out of a large project to build space for 6,000 workers near Seattle as it announced layoffs in January, and Microsoft has delayed some work on its overhaul of its headquarters campus. Yelp vacated its headquarters in San Francisco, where Salesforce has cut back on leases as well.
The pullback, combined with the persistence of employees working remotely, has hobbled cities that relied on tech workers to frequent cafes, doggy day cares, and transit.
Last month, Mr. Jassy wrote in a letter to employees that most corporate staff would be expected to return to the office three days a week starting on May 1. It caused grumbling from many Amazon workers, but cheering from city officials in Seattle and Bellevue.
“Events really did change,” said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto who has studied urban development and tech for more than two decades. “We did have a pandemic, remote work became a thing. But I think this is yet another cautionary tale, perhaps the ultimate cautionary tale, of not betting a whole community on a company.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The slowdown at Amazon’s HQ2 is perhaps the most indicative of how quickly the tides have changed from its ambitions of just a few years ago. Amazon kicked off an international frenzy in 2017 when it announced its search for a second headquarters, saying it wanted to find a place where it could expand to house 50,000 employees. Hundreds of cities and towns around North America threw themselves at Amazon, hoping to attract what were seen as well-paid jobs of the future.
But long-shot hopes were dashed in late 2018, when Amazon announced that it would be split the second headquarters equally between Queens and Arlington, Va., two metro areas where Amazon already had more employees than anywhere else outside of Seattle and the Bay Area.
At the time, the company said that the developments would require $5 billion in construction and other investments. Amazon was offered more than $2 billion in tax incentives from New York and Virginia.
The tax breaks, and concerns over gentrification, caused fierce community, union and political pushback over the campus in Long Island City, and in early 2019, Amazon canceled its plans for the Queens campus.
The company said it might still pursue permits and other pre-construction work on the second phase of the project in Virginia later this year.
“We continue to work with Amazon to advance plans for Pen Place, and look forward to helping Amazon realize its complete vision for HQ2,” Matt Kelly, the chief executive of JBG Smith, the developer of the project, said in a statement."

And “Dilbert,” which followed the titular engineer through various white-collar woes, was syndicated in hundreds of newspapers across the country until this week, when the comic strip was widely dropped after its creator Scott Adams’s racist rant on a YouTube livestream. For some, it was no surprise that Dilbert was disappearing — a bigger surprise was that “Dilbert” was still a thing more than 40 years after it was created (especially given Mr. Adams’s history of offensive remarks).
But the material — life under the glare of fluorescents, the joys of middle management — provides eternal inspiration and fellow feeling.
“When workplace comedies poke fun at these shared experiences and identities, they reinforce a sense of camaraderie,” said Jennifer Aaker, a Stanford business professor and co-author of “Humor, Seriously.” Her colleague and co-author, Naomi Bagdonas, added that workplace humor, including on social media, can help people deal with the “exceptionally unfunny times” we are living in. “When many are experiencing stress and burnout, humor can be particularly effective at boosting morale and productivity,” she said.
A new generation of comedians is creating content that responds to and sends up the shifting norms of work. On TikTok and Instagram, memes and videos lampooning everything from Zoom etiquette to Gen Z email signoffs and layoffs are going viral.

Jes Staley’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein go back decades.

Jes Staley is sued over Jeffrey Epstein
At JPMorgan Chase, James “Jes” Staley rose through the ranks, leading its asset management and investment banking businesses and becoming a top lieutenant to the banking giant’s chief, Jamie Dimon.
But JPMorgan sued Staley on Wednesday, accusing him of failing to fully inform the bank about what he knew about Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in federal custody in 2019 and was a longtime client. If JPMorgan is found liable for providing banking services to Epstein, it wants its former executive to pay up.
JPMorgan itself has been sued twice over Epstein, who had been a client of the firm’s until 2013. In one suit, the U.S. Virgin Islands argues that the bank should have been aware of Mr. Epstein’s yearslong abuse of young women, given the financier’s closeness with Mr. Staley. The other, filed by a woman identified only as Jane Doe who says she was a victim of Mr. Epstein’s, accused JPMorgan of failing to stop his crimes.
JPMorgan has denied that it is liable, and is seeking to have the lawsuits dismissed. It has also been fighting off efforts to depose Dimon in connection with the litigation.
Mr. Staley had long been tied to Epstein, dating back to when he was running JPMorgan’s private bank. Mr. Epstein was a source of client referrals, elevating Staley’s status within the bank. The two men stayed close — even after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a prostitution solicitation charge involving a teenage girl.
Mr. Staley has said he didn’t know about Mr. Epstein’s crimes and regrets the relationship. But the lawsuits filed against JPMorgan argue otherwise: The Virgin Islands contends that the two men had swapped sexually suggestive emails about young women even after 2008. And the Jane Doe lawsuit contends that an unidentified friend of Epstein’s sexually assaulted her and visited young girls at Epstein residences; JPMorgan said in its lawsuit that the friend was Staley."
2023-03-10,"Kirsten Paige Erwin said she felt an immediate sense of calm on her first date with Ricardo Kozuchowicz in March 2017.
The two met for dinner at the Saint, a now-closed Mexican restaurant in Seattle, after connecting on a dating app. But while their easy connection was developing, so was Mr. Kozuchowicz’s struggle to secure a visa and stay in the country.
Mr. Kozuchowicz, 35, is from São Paulo, Brazil. He received a bachelor’s degree in economics at Fundação Getulio Vargas, a Brazilian higher education institute, before moving to the United States at 26 to pursue an M.B.A. from Duke University. He is now the corporate finance lead at Mercury, a San Francisco-based financial technology company that provides banking for start-ups.
Ms. Erwin, 38, grew up in Tacoma, Wash. She has a bachelor’s degree in art and Spanish from Willamette University and is a senior art director at Slice, a technology platform based in New York City for small-scale pizzerias.

When they met, Mr. Kozuchowicz was working as a finance manager for Microsoft on a one-year extension of his student visa. He had been hoping for a work visa but, while getting to know Ms. Erwin, he began to realize that chances of this were slim.
A few months after their first date, he learned he was not granted the visa. He made plans to relocate to Vancouver on a Canadian working permit in the summer of 2017. Ms. Erwin helped him pack and their relationship became long distance.
It was unclear when he would be able to come back to the country. Ms. Erwin described the time apart as an exercise in mindfulness. “You can’t control a relationship and you really can’t control the U.S. government,” she said. “I had to go day by day and ask, ‘Do I still want to be here?’” Each time, she said, her answer was yes.
Good news came in the form of a work visa for Mr. Kozuchowicz in the fall of 2018 and a return to Seattle for the Microsoft job in January 2019. The couple chose to live independently for a year while they considered their future.

While the work visa was welcome, Mr. Kozuchowicz said that there was still another piece missing. His visa only allowed him to stay in the country if he remained with the same company. In December 2019, he was granted a green card — the missing piece — and his possibilities expanded.

They moved in together in Seattle in 2020 and, in early 2021, relocated to New York City, in part to establish themselves somewhere new. They settled on an apartment in the West Village where they still live today. With the move came a sense of increased commitment to their relationship and, according to Ms. Erwin, “the word ‘marriage’ began to slip in” to their conversations.
In November 2021, Mr. Kozuchowicz began designing an engagement ring with a jeweler. He chose a black diamond and a pink sapphire since he knew Ms. Erwin would want something colorful.
There was a snowstorm the day the ring arrived in January 2022. The couple went for a walk in Washington Square Park and came across a group having a snowball fight by the fountain. They found their way to a quieter area and Mr. Kozuchowicz proposed.
When it came to planning a wedding, the couple wanted to join their different backgrounds. Besides growing up in separate countries with different languages, Mr. Kozuchowicz is Jewish and Ms. Erwin is not religious. Their officiant was Rabbi Bradley Bleefeld of Temple Beth Hillel-Beth Abraham in Millville, N.J., who specializes in interfaith and international couples.
Their wedding on Feb. 25 was held in the Palm House of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for about 150 guests. It was also the first time most of their family members met. Even though they are not traditional in many Brazilian weddings, both of Mr. Kozuchowicz’s parents gave speeches — in English, even though the couple insisted Portuguese would be fine.
Ms. Erwin’s parents jumped on board as well. Her father, a “really reserved guy” was hoisted into the air for the hora, holding his chair with one hand and lifting the other “like he was in a rodeo,” Ms. Erwin said. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw him up there.”"

Bailout nation
Andrew here. Federal regulators on Sunday unveiled the most sweeping backstop for the U.S. banking system since the 2008 crisis, to limit carnage from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The decision has shaken up global markets, with investors selling bank stocks and betting that the Fed would hold off on further interest rate rises.
Monday’s newsletter is a special edition deep dive into what just happened. Let’s start with some takeaways from the dizzying turn of events: Too Big to Fail is as alive as ever, but now no bank is too small to fail as well.
Banking is now officially a government-backed business, if it wasn’t before. Let’s admit it: Once the government guarantees all deposits, the “business” of banking isn’t much of a business — and maybe shouldn’t be. This is likely to become the biggest debate of the coming weeks and months.
The venture capital community, a group that includes a vocal group of libertarians, was just bailed out. Yes, these investors do good by funding start-ups, but they have also long lobbied for fewer regulations and also benefited from the special treatment of carried interest. This all looks particularly egregious after some of them spent the weekend begging for government help.
But the reality is that if S.V.B. was just a small regional bank that did not have ties to loud, politically connected venture capitalists and the tech community, it might have been allowed to die — and its customers, individuals and small businesses, would have suffered. Instead, because it is Silicon Valley, it commanded attention.
We have become a country of bailouts. We did it after the Sept. 11 attacks, in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, during the pandemic — and now we are at it again. For those that say we should have lower taxes and shouldn’t fund the government, how are these bailouts supposed to be financed? (It’s also fair to say regulators should have done a better job, but the truth is that they have been pushed to do less, not more.)

2023-03-14,"Four months ago, a small San Francisco company became the talk of the technology industry when it introduced a new online chatbot that could answer complex questions, write poetry and even mimic human emotions.
Now the company is back with a new version of the technology that powers its chatbots. The system will up the ante in Silicon Valley’s race to embrace artificial intelligence and decide who will be the next generation of leaders in the technology industry.
OpenAI, which has around 375 employees but has been backed with billions of dollars of investment from Microsoft and industry celebrities, said on Tuesday that it had released a technology that it calls GPT-4. It was designed to be the underlying engine that powers chatbots and all sorts of other systems, from search engines to personal online tutors.
Most people will use this technology through a new version of the company’s ChatGPT chatbot, while businesses will incorporate it into a wide variety of systems, including business software and e-commerce websites. The technology already drives the chatbot available to a limited number of people using Microsoft’s Bing search engine.
OpenAI’s progress has, within just a few months, landed the technology industry in one of its most unpredictable moments in decades. Many industry leaders believe developments in A.I. represent a fundamental technological shift, as important as the creation of web browsers in the early 1990s. The rapid improvement has stunned computer scientists.

2023-03-15,"WASHINGTON — A hacking group with ties to the Russian government appears to be preparing new cyberattacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure and government offices, Microsoft said in a report on Wednesday, suggesting that Russia’s long-anticipated spring offensive could include action in cyberspace, as well as on the ground.
The report also said that Russia appears to be stepping up influence operations outside Ukraine, in a push to weaken European and American support for continuing military aid, intelligence sharing and other assistance to the Ukrainian government. The effort would come as a faction in the Republican Party — and some in the Democratic Party — argues that supporting Ukraine is not a core interest for the United States.
For now Russia’s main influence campaign is concentrated in Europe, but it will shift to the United States “as the year gets closer to a presidential election debate going into fall,” said Clint Watts, the head of Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center.
Since before the war began a year ago, Russia’s efforts to use its considerable cybercapabilities against Ukraine, and its failure to cripple the government in ways American officials had expected, have been a subject of intense study, and some mystery.
Evidence amassed in recent months shows that Russia often tried to coordinate cyberattacks with physical attacks on the Ukrainian power grid and other targets. But the Ukrainians were often a step ahead of Moscow, and had backup systems in place or rigged new ones, including moving much of the country’s digital operations to the cloud.
Microsoft’s report carries significant weight because the company’s warnings of pending cyberattacks in the run-up to the war were largely accurate. But it also suggests that Russia’s digital warriors, many of whom are linked to the country’s intelligence services, are trying anew in the second year of the war."
2023-03-16,"TikTok has what many Silicon Valley companies lust after: A culture-making machine beloved by 100 million Americans and deep-pocketed advertisers.
That doesn’t mean they will line up to buy it.
TikTok said on Wednesday that the Biden administration was pushing the company’s Chinese owners to sell the app or face a possible ban. But there are probably few companies, in the tech industry or elsewhere, willing or able to buy it, analysts and experts say.
At a price of $50 billion or more — the value some analysts said TikTok could command — the social media platform would be too expensive for many companies, including competitors like Snap. The tech giants that could afford it, such as Facebook owner Meta, Google and Microsoft, are likely to shy away for fear of getting caught in years of antitrust scrutiny in the United States. Then there’s the headache of owning a social media company, and figuring out how to handle the endless flood of toxic content.
In addition, it remains unclear how TikTok would fully unravel itself from ByteDance, its parent company in China, or whether any deal would be approved by the Chinese government.

TikTok “has a lot of baggage, and that baggage means that it’s hard to make this a reality,” said Brian Wieser, an independent consultant who focuses on the media and advertising industries.
There may be other options, such as a private equity company swooping in with an offer with a partner, or ByteDance spinning off TikTok into a stand-alone public company. But if there are a limited number of potential suitors it may complicate the White House’s efforts, and continue to drag out what has already been a yearslong battle between Washington and the company.

TikTok has been in the cross hairs of both the Trump and Biden administrations, both of which have said that the app poses a national security threat. Lawmakers have been increasingly concerned that TikTok could put sensitive user data, like location information, into the hands of the Chinese government. They have pointed to laws that allow Beijing to secretly demand data from Chinese companies and citizens for intelligence-gathering operations.
More than two dozen states have issued bans of the app on state-owned devices, and several pieces of federal legislation are also aimed at banning TikTok.

John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, declined to comment on Thursday about whether the administration was pushing ByteDance to sell TikTok. But he said that “we have legitimate national security concerns here, and outside of all that, we continue to support bipartisan legislation that’s designed to address those security concerns posed by certain foreign-owned consumer apps.”
TikTok said this week that it was weighing its options and that a security proposal it offered the government in August offered the best protection for American users. Under the proposal, the company would spend more than $1.5 billion to cordon off access to sensitive U.S. user data and offer oversight and transparency around its content recommendations.
The company’s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, who is Singaporean, is scheduled to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee next Thursday. Lawmakers are expected to question him about the app’s ties to China and the content it delivers to young people.
Maureen Shanahan, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said in a statement: “If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn’t solve the problem: A change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access.”

The Biden administration’s push for a sale mirrors the effort by the Trump administration three years ago. At that time, Mr. Trump threatened to ban TikTok from Apple and Google’s app stores unless the app was sold to an American company. A group of federal agencies that review national security concerns related to foreign companies, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, had recommended such a move.
Possible buyers for the app included Microsoft and the cloud computing company Oracle. But the Chinese government issued export restrictions in August 2020 that potentially allowed Beijing to block a sale. While Oracle and Walmart ultimately seemed to reach an agreement to buy stakes in the app, resolving Mr. Trump’s concerns, the deal never closed.
Multiple federal courts later ruled that Mr. Trump did not have the authority to ban the app, limiting the government’s leverage in the case. (Oracle has since been working with TikTok to help it store U.S. user data in domestic servers and has been a key partner in its plan to assuage national security concerns.)
When President Biden took office, the administration initially focused on negotiating a deal through CFIUS with TikTok that would settle the concerns without a forced sale. The company assumed its talks would resolve soon after it submitted a 90-page proposal to the administration in August, but its efforts have been stymied by several revelations around how ByteDance and TikTok have mishandled U.S. user data.

And now, any potential sale looks even more complicated than before.
“It’s much more fraught on all levels on the economics of it,” said Glenn S. Gerstell, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic & International Studies and the former general counsel of the National Security Agency. “TikTok now has two years of user growth, it’s far more entrenched in terms of its position in American social media, and clearly the tensions with China have greatly increased.”
Antitrust officials at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are increasingly concerned about attempts by tech giants to buy other companies. The F.T.C. unsuccessfully challenged Meta’s acquisition of a small virtual reality start-up and is trying to block Microsoft from buying the video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard.
“I think the whole concern with tech platform dominance would be a factor in what buyer or buyers would be acceptable,” said William J. Baer, a former head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division. “A tech platform would legitimately have to think about the antitrust risk of buying something that, while not directly a competitor, would be seen as expanding the dominance of that platform in the tech space.”
The uncertainty around TikTok’s future has been felt by its U.S. employees, who are spread among locations including Los Angeles, the Bay Area, New York and Washington. Morale at the company has waned as state bans and legislation targeting TikTok have gained traction, according to three employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
TikTok leaders briefly addressed a potential divestment during a companywide livestream on Tuesday, where executives told employees that a divestment would not address the U.S. government’s concerns, according to two of the employees.

In an internal note sent after news broke about the Biden administration’s push, Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s head of public policy for the Americas, called the Biden administration’s push a “developing situation” and said that “divestment doesn’t solve anything” if protecting national security is the objective. He added that the company’s strategy to build systems to store U.S. user data on U.S.-based servers monitored by a third party “remains the same.”
“We feel strongly that this conversation should include the industry at large and not be based on where a company was founded,"" Mr. Beckerman wrote.

2023-03-17,"It was a week of market turmoil that began with the collapse of a small bank in the United States, spiraled into a panic about the global financial system and ended with a bold effort to stanch the cascading crisis that ultimately fell short.
And it was the clearest illustration yet of the dangerous side effects of campaigns by central banks to raise interest rates.
In the year since the Federal Reserve began pushing rates higher, in an effort to stamp out runaway inflation, investors have watched shares of speculative tech companies crash, emerging markets fall into default and the nascent cryptocurrency market crumple.
This week, it was the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a midsize bank that served start-ups and venture capital firms, that incited chaos in the markets and prompted fears of a financial crisis.

Stocks swung wildly day to day, oil prices slid to lows not seen in over a year and yields on government bonds suddenly reversed their march higher as investors began to wonder about the impact of the escalating crisis on the economy. The dust is yet to settle. Here’s a summary of what happened in markets this week, and what it tells us about investors’ views of the world going forward.
A crisis in small banks was provoked by a collapse in California.

The trouble began on March 8, when Silicon Valley Bank revealed steep losses on its portfolio of government bonds and mortgages, ostensibly safe investments that backed the bank’s deposits and that had taken a hit from rising interest rates. The bank’s shares plunged, depositors rushed to pull out their money and, within days, authorities seized control of the bank (as well as Signature Bank, based in New York), pledging to keep it open for business.
But in the markets, investors couldn’t shake the worry that other banks were facing similar problems, and that induced a panic regarding a number of small lenders, including First Republic Bank, PacWest and Western Alliance. The wave of selling in their shares appeared to subside on Thursday, after a group of rival lenders said they would bolster First Republic with $30 billion in deposits. Then on Friday, selling resumed, and First Republic dropped a further 20 percent.
The selling has left shares of the banks’ sharply lower than they were before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. First Republic has lost over 80 percent of its value since the start of the month, PacWest and Western Alliance roughly 60 percent.

The broader stock market seemed to look beyond this week’s turmoil.
The good news for most investors is that the S&P 500 was resilient to worries that centered on the banking industry, and after a big rally on Thursday, the index ended the week with a gain of 1.4 percent.
It shows that, to stock investors at least, the crisis in the banking sector appears mostly contained. It helped that policymakers in the United States and Europe stepped in to back their banks. Authorities guaranteed deposits at SVB and Signature, and in Europe, Credit Suisse said it would tap a $54 billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank after investors there began to panic over its financial state — though for very different reasons than with SVB.
There are also some characteristics of the S&P 500 that can mask some of the pain under the surface. Insulated from the trouble in the regional banks, Microsoft, Alphabet and the chip-maker Nvidia all rose more than 10 percent this week. The sheer size of these big companies means their gains helped lift the whole index.
But investors in other markets are worried about the economy.
2-year Treasury yield
Note: Data through market close on Friday, March 17Source: FactSetBy The New York Times
Perhaps the starkest evidence of a shifting view on the economy came in the market for government bonds. On Wednesday, the yield on two-year U.S. government notes, known as Treasuries, plummeted by a magnitude greater than Black Monday in October 1987, one of the worst market crashes on record.

The two-year yield is a barometer of changing expectations for interest rates, and it had been climbing fast as investors bet on further rate hikes from the Fed.
In early March, the yield had crossed above 5 percent for the first time since 2007. By Friday, the yield had tumbled to 3.85 percent — a huge swing by the bond market’s standards.
The signal from the markets was clear: The Fed is going to need to start cutting interest rates, instead of raising them, sooner than was thought — something it typically does only when the economy runs into trouble.
The benchmark U.S. price for a barrel of crude oil

It isn’t just the American economy that investors are worried about. A slide in commodity prices this week shows that they’re concerned about the global economy, too.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Crude oil prices are illustrative of this. After suffering its second sharpest fall of the year, on Wednesday, followed up by another sharp decline on Friday, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude is now at its lowest price since late 2021.
Demand for oil is global, making it a barometer for the health of the world’s economy. It often fluctuates with economic news from other parts of the world. When things are booming, oil demand is high, and oil prices typically rise. Such a sharp fall is a warning that investors fear demand will wane if the economy falters.
In other words, it may not be over yet.
Investors remain on tenterhooks about the potential for more damage to emerge — illustrated by the continued churn in bank stocks and bond yields.
Asked about the possible risks, some analysts point to other corners of the market susceptible to high interest rates, like the corporate debt market that ballooned after the 2008 financial crisis. The pain in the banking sector could also prompt lenders to pull back from new business, tightening access to a crucial source of cash should companies start to run into trouble — restrictions that could weigh on growth.
And, of course, a big fear for investors is that something has yet to be uncovered, like the trouble at a regional bank in Silicon Valley just over a week ago."

2023-03-20,"Banning TikTok won’t keep us safe.
As you may have heard, the United States government is in the midst of a full-on panic about TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app best known for its ability to inspire teens to try out new dance moves.
Last week, the White House reportedly demanded that TikTok’s owners sell or face a ban. The ultimatum comes after months of anti-TikTok rhetoric: The head of the National Security Agency told Congress he is concerned about TikTok being used for foreign influence operations. A dozen senators introduced a White House-endorsed bill that would give the government broad powers to ban the app and other technology from China and five other unfriendly nations. Over two dozen states have passed legislation banning TikTok from government-owned devices. And the director of national intelligence said that parents should be worried about their kids using the app.
This week, Congress is hauling TikTok’s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, in for a grilling about TikTok’s use of data about Americans, its impact on kids and its relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.
If only all the tech giants that prey on Americans’ data were getting the same scrutiny and enforced accountability. While Congress has been up in arms about TikTok, it has failed to pass even the most basic comprehensive privacy legislation to protect our data from being misused by all the tech companies that collect and mine it. Congress has also failed to follow the lead of Europe with its recent push to force platforms to be more accountable for the disinformation that they spread.
This whole episode is part of a larger red scare, in which the United States is taking an increasingly confrontational stance against China through economic sanctions imposed in the name of national security. U.S. tech executives and national security leaders have fed into this narrative, warning of an A.I. cold war in which China could surpass the United States in building artificial intelligence.
But when you dig into the national security allegations against TikTok, it is telling that most of the charges could just as easily be levied against the U.S. tech giants. And most of the tech companies’ exploitation of data has not been curbed by the government."

EZRA KLEIN: I’m Ezra Klein. This is “The Ezra Klein Show.”
So let me start this one by situating us in time. So we taped this podcast just a few hours after OpenAI released GPT-4, which is their most powerful A.I. language model yet. The thing that is remarkable here that I really keep trying to push people to key into is how quickly these systems are getting better, how steep the curve of improvement is. We talked about some benchmarks here on the show. But GPT-4 passes the bar exam in the 90th percentile — the 90th percentile. Just sit with that.
We were nowhere near fully understanding what the last generation of these models could do. Now we’re on to the next one. And the same is probably going to be true here. GPT-4 — it is extremely powerful. It is, at times, unnerving. We barely understand what it can do or how to use it. And yet everybody is racing ahead. GPT-4 also is going to be a toy, a diversion, compared to what we’re going to have in three or five years.
If you heard the commentary I released on A.I. on the podcast over the weekend, you heard that what I’m most focused on is how society manages to adapt to the speed at which these systems are improving, or else slows them down so we have more time to adapt to understand them to think about how we want to integrate them. And one piece of feedback I got in my commentary was, what are you really saying we should do, aside from being anxious? And I don’t just want people to be anxious."
2023-03-22,"In June 1972, Bob Metcalfe, a 26-year-old engineer fresh out of graduate school, joined a new research lab in Palo Alto, Calif., as it set out to build something that few people could even imagine: a personal computer.
After another engineer gave up the job, Dr. Metcalfe was asked to build a technology that could connect the desktop machines across an office and send information between them. The result was Ethernet, a computer networking technology that would one day become an industry standard. For decades, it has connected PCs to servers, printers and the internet in corporate offices and homes across the globe.
For his work on Ethernet, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world’s largest society of computing professionals, announced on Wednesday that Dr. Metcalfe, 76, would receive this year’s Turing Award. Given since 1966 and often called the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award comes with a $1 million prize.
When Dr. Metcalfe arrived at the Palo Alto Research Center — a division of Xerox nicknamed PARC — the first thing he did was connect the lab to the Arpanet, the wide-area network that later morphed into the modern internet. The Arpanet transmitted information among about 20 academic and corporate labs across the country.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s apparent backtracking on broader insurance for bank deposits worried markets.

No clear path on helping banks
U.S. banking regulators gave investors a lot to chew on yesterday. The Federal Reserve went ahead with a quarter-point increase in interest rates, signaling that, for now, it remained more worried about inflation than banking stability.
But while Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chair, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that they were focused on ways to improve regulation of the banking industry, Ms. Yellen appeared to backtrack on the prospect of extending insurance on deposits. That lack of clarity unnerved investors yesterday, sending shares in smaller banks tumbling, as they worried about what’s next.
The Fed acknowledged that it may finally stop raising rates — “may” being the operative word, Mr. Powell said. Though officials forecast one more rate increase this year, that’s not set in stone. In some ways, Mr. Powell added, the turmoil hitting lenders now is effectively substituting for additional rate increases.
How the government will act on banking regulation remains unclear. Both Mr. Powell and Ms. Yellen suggested that more oversight was needed, though the Fed chair acknowledged that the central bank’s supervisors had had “not been effective” at preventing problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. (The latest embarrassing revelation: The governor of the Bank of England told Britain’s Parliament yesterday that he had warned the San Francisco Fed about Silicon Valley Bank over the past two years.)

Among the suggestions the two made were updating stress test models for lenders and giving back additional authority to the Financial Stability Oversight Council.
But Ms. Yellen appeared to dent market confidence yesterday when she told senators that the Biden administration would not consider adopting universal deposit insurance without congressional approval. The comments — which appeared to walk back suggestions she made a day earlier to an American Banking Association gathering — revived fears that the government was dithering about how to restore depositors’ confidence in banks.
Ms. Yellen’s remarks reflect the stark political reality that expansive new regulations are unlikely, given Republican opposition. (“If you have a hammer, the world looks like a nail,” said Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee.)
But markets are worried that the lack of a clear path forward will endanger wobbling lenders like First Republic and Pacific Western, the latter of which said yesterday that it had borrowed billions after losing 20 percent of its deposits since the start of the year. Shares in both companies fell sharply yesterday.
In other banking news: Saule Omarova, whom President Biden had nominated to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, proposes a government “golden share” in major banks to help prevent future crises. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed creating an inspector general for the Fed. And the banking crisis is weighing on the commercial real estate market.

The wait for an indictment of Donald Trump continues. The Manhattan grand jury that will decide whether to charge the former president over a hush-money payout to a porn star didn’t meet yesterday. It may do so today, The Times reports — but if the jury does, it isn’t clear whether the panel will hear from more witnesses or proceed to vote on charges.
Toshiba reportedly plans to sell itself for $15 billion. The Japanese conglomerate has accepted a takeover bid led by the investment firm Japan Industrial Partners, according to Nikkei Asia. The decision will conclude a yearslong effort to sell Toshiba, as the company has sought to restructure itself.
The bidding for Manchester United heats up. Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire British industrialist, reportedly plans to raise his offer for the English soccer club to more than £5 billion ($6.1 billion), according to The Financial Times. He’s competing against Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, a Qatari businessman, and others, in a process that could set a record price for a pro sports team — or fail to end in a sale.

TikTok goes to Congress
The C.E.O. of TikTok, Shou Chew, will face questions from U.S. lawmakers today over fears that the social media platform poses a national security risk. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the app, which now claims some 150 million American users, if ByteDance, its Chinese owner, refuses to sell it.

But TikTok says those fears are overblown — and the company has enlisted American allies to help make its case.
U.S. officials are worried about two main issues:
How the data of U.S. users is stored, with policymakers arguing that Chinese laws give Beijing the power to demand data from companies for intelligence-gathering operations.
The possibility of Bejing using the app to spread misinformation, a concern of U.S. intelligence.
Mr. Shou will say today that the company is “not an agent of China or any other country,” according to prepared testimony. He will add that ByteDance is owned by its founders, its employees — including Americans — and by global investors, including the asset management giant BlackRock and the investment firms General Atlantic and Sequoia. General Atlantic’s C.E.O., William Ford, sits on ByteDance’s board.

Mr. Shou will also point to a plan TikTok proposed in August, called Project Texas, that is meant to further insulate American user data from Chinese government meddling. Under the plan, U.S. user information would be stored in America on servers managed by the Silicon Valley giant Oracle.
A few American allies spoke out in TikTok’s defense yesterday. They included Representative Jamaal Bowman, Democrat of New York, who called for a more “nuanced” conversation. He spoke at a news conference alongside about 30 prominent TikTokers whom the company had brought to Capitol Hill.

Mr. Bowman conceded that there were security and data privacy concerns, but he argued that American social media companies like Facebook and Twitter weren’t immune to such issues either. “Why the hell are we whipping ourselves into a hysteria to scapegoat TikTok?” he told The Times.
That may not be enough to help TikTok. Gabriel Wildau, the head of China political risk at the advisory firm Teneo, told DealBook that the U.S.’s justifications mirror those Beijing uses to block American tech companies.
“In the current atmosphere of panic about China, a sober assessment of risk is impossible,” he said.
“There were a couple of tweets and then this thing went down much faster than has happened in history.”

Coinbase is in the cross hairs
The crypto exchange Coinbase disclosed yesterday that the S.E.C. was likely to sue it for potential violations of securities laws. News that the company received a Wells notice, an indication that enforcement actions are coming, sent its shares down 12 percent.
If that lawsuit comes, it would set off a battle between America’s biggest crypto business and a regulator intent on cracking down on what it views as an untamed industry rife with dangers.
The S.E.C. is concerned about several parts of Coinbase’s business, the exchange said. Among them is its staking business, in which investors users pledge certain crypto holdings to companies in exchange for hefty returns. (Those borrowed holdings in turn are used to validate crypto transactions.)
Staking was what drove the S.E.C. last month to charge Kraken, a smaller crypto exchange, with securities violations. That company agreed to a $30 million fine and to stop offering staking services to U.S. customers.

The Wells notice also indicated concern about Coinbase’s crypto wallet and, more broadly, some assets listed on its exchange.
Coinbase isn’t going down without a fight. The exchange’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said that the company was prepared to defend itself in court if necessary. He also noted that the S.E.C. had reviewed Coinbase’s listings and staking processes two years ago as part of the exchange’s move to go public. (Of note: That process took place before Gary Gensler, the S.E.C.’s current chair, was sworn in.)
And Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s co-founder and C.E.O., accused the S.E.C. of refusing to engage with crypto companies on setting up clear rules the industry could follow — and was instead turning to enforcement action. The coming fight will allow Coinbase to show “that the S.E.C. simply has not been fair, reasonable, or even demonstrated a seriousness of purpose when it comes to its engagement on digital assets,” Armstrong tweeted.
The stakes are high. Coinbase is among the biggest and most regulated companies in the crypto industry and its standard-bearer in the U.S. Armstrong has repeatedly accused regulators of making America inhospitable to crypto innovation.
But Mr. Gensler has made clear that he thinks many practices in crypto are sorely in need of regulating — a point underscored yesterday when the agency sued the prominent crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun and celebrities like the actress Lindsay Lohan over promotion of his digital tokens.

Faced with challenging situations in parenting, romance or work, some are getting by with a little help from their A.I. friends.

Todd Mitchem kept struggling to have honest, productive conversations with his son. “He’s 15,” Mr. Mitchem, 52, said with a laugh. “Teenagers are so difficult to connect with.”
Every time he tried to bring up a sensitive issue, his son would give vague answers or run away, preferring to avoid serious talks altogether.
In the past when Mr. Mitchem needed parenting help, he would read a book or pose a question to the men’s support group he meets with weekly.
But recently he has turned to ChatGPT. And he’s not alone: Others are turning to artificial intelligence chat bots to figure out what to say in situations that feel high-stakes. They are using the tool to talk or read to their children, to approach bosses, to provide difficult feedback, to write wedding vows or to pen love letters.

Unlike turning to friends or even professionals for help, the bot, said Mr. Mitchem, gives what feels like objective advice. “The bot is giving me responses based on analysis and data, not human emotions,” he said.
ChatGPT, the new virtual tool powered by Open AI, sources its information from a wide range of online material including books, news articles, scientific journals, websites and even message boards, allowing users to have humanlike conversions with a chat bot.  
“It’s giving you what the collective hive mind on the internet would say,” said Irina Raicu, who directs the internet ethics program at Santa Clara University. (Other companies including Google and Microsoft have their own versions of this technology, and Microsoft’s, called Bing A.I., was recently made famous for aggressively declaring its love to the New York Times journalist Kevin Roose.)
Mr. Mitchem, who lives in Denver and is the executive vice president of learning and product for a leadership training company, opened his conversation by typing, in summary: “I need some friendly advice.”
“OK, no problem,” ChatGPT responded, according to Mr. Mitchem. “What is your name?”
In the course of their conversation, ChatGPT told Mr. Mitchem that he is a good father for even wondering how to approach a conversation with his son about the decision to join a basketball team. “It said something like, ‘It’s cool if you don’t get it right, but it’s awesome that you are trying.”

Mr. Mitchem said the bot then continued: “Teenage boys, when they are growing up, are trying to force their independence. Remember when you talk to him, he needs to know that you trust your decisions.”
The next day Mr. Mitchem approached his son and tried out the advice. “I said to him, ‘You need to make this decision, you are 14, and I trust you will make a good one,” Mr. Mitchem said. “My son goes, ‘Wow, that’s awesome. I’ll let you know what I decide.’”
“We left on a positive note,” Mr. Mitchem said. “It totally worked.”

Once Upon a Time …
For Naif Alanazi, a 35-year-old Ph.D. student at Kent State University, bedtime is a sacred ritual for him and his 4-year-old daughter, Yasmeen. “I have to work all day,” he said. “This is our special time.”
His Saudi Arabian family has a deep tradition of telling oral stories. Wanting to continue it, he used to try to concoct new, thrilling tales each evening. “Do you know how difficult it is to come up with something new every day?” he asked, laughing.
Now, however, he lets the bot do the work.
Every night he asks ChatGPT to create a story that involves people (his daughter’s teacher, for instance) and places (school, the park) from her day, along with a cliffhanger at the end so he continue the story the next night. “Sometimes I ask it to add a value she needs to learn like honesty or being kind to others,” he said.

“Being able to give her something that is more than a generic story, something that can increase our bond and show her that I am interested in her daily life,” he said, “it makes me feel so much closer to her.”

Love Languages
Anifa Musengimana, 25, who is in graduate school for international marketing in London, is certain that chat bots can help make the tedium of online dating more interesting. “I am having a lot of repetitive conversations on these apps,” she said. “The app can give me fun ideas of what to talk about, and maybe I’ll find better people to date.”
“If I get intriguing answers, I will be drawn in,” she said.
She said she would tell her match she was using the tool. “I would want a guy who finds it funny,” she said. “I wouldn’t want a guy who is so serious that he gets mad at me for doing it.”
Some are using chat bots to enhance the relationships they already have.
James Gregson, 40, a creative director who lives in Avon, Conn., has been using ChatGPT to draft love letters to his wife.
“I am not a poet, I am not a songwriter, but I can take topics on things my wife might like and put it into a song or poem,” he said.

He also believes in full disclosure: “I am going to give her one, but I am going to tell her who wrote it,” he said. “I am not trying to con her.”

Office Applications
Jessica Massey, 29, a finance analyst at Cisco Systems, who lives in Buffalo, has been writing draft emails to her boss using ChatGPT. “I wanted to test out its capabilities to see if there was a different way A.I. would word what I was thinking in my head,” she wrote in an email. (One person interviewed confessed to consulting ChatGPT to help prepare for their interview for this story. Another admitted to using it for employee reviews.)
Ms. Massey used the bot to write an email to her boss explaining why the company should pay for a certain professional certification. The bot gave her pretty boilerplate language, she said. She hasn’t sent it yet, but plans to once she changes “the verbiage a bit to make it sound more like me.”
Ms. Massey, however, has a rule about relying on a chat bot: “Disclose it at the end of your work or not use it at all.”
However, scholars who study technology and ethics have mixed feelings about using ChatGPT for highly personal communication.

“We shouldn’t automatically reject tools that might help people deal with a difficult conversation,” said Michael Zimmer, the director of the Center for Data, Ethics and Society at Marquette University. He equates it to buying a Hallmark Card for a birthday or anniversary. “We’ve all accepted doing that because the words on the card align with something I believe,” he said.
However, Ms. Raicu, from Santa Clara University, worries about people using ChatGPT for personal communication. She doesn’t like the idea that there is a “right” and “wrong” way to communicate. “I think the right words depend on who the people are who are communicating and the context,” she said. “There is no formula for a lot of this stuff.”
Ms. Raicu said that using ChatGPT for personal communication may undermine trust: “People might ask, ‘Do I really know who I am talking to?’”

2023-03-26,"When Apple held a corporate retreat in California’s Carmel Valley about five years ago to discuss its next major product, Jony Ive, its longtime design chief, captivated a room of the company’s 100 top executives with a concept video as polished as an Apple commercial.
The video showed a man in a London taxi donning an augmented reality headset and calling his wife in San Francisco. “Would you like to come to London?” he asked, two people who saw the video said. Soon, the couple were sharing the sights of London through the husband’s eyes.
The video excited executives about the possibilities of Apple’s next business-altering device: a headset that would blend the digital world with the real one.
But now, as the company prepares to introduce the headset in June, enthusiasm at Apple has given way to skepticism, said eight current and former employees, who requested anonymity because of Apple’s policies against speaking about future products. There are concerns about the device’s roughly $3,000 price, doubts about its utility and worries about its unproven market.
That dissension has been a surprising change inside a company where employees have built devices — from the iPod to the Apple Watch — with the single-mindedness of a moon mission.
Some employees have defected from the project because of their doubts about its potential, three people with knowledge of the moves said. Others have been fired over the lack of progress with some aspects of the headset, including its use of Apple’s Siri voice assistant, one person said."

Netanyahu backs off 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would delay his government’s contentious plans to overhaul Israel’s judiciary, after days of massive street protests, counter-protests and strikes that halted some health services and blocked flights from leaving Israel’s main airport. Follow live updates.
Netanyahu’s reversal came after the head of a powerful far-right political party, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he was open to postponing the vote, giving Netanyahu room to step back. His concession is an attempt to de-escalate the civil unrest, but he risks destabilizing the government. Many of his hard-right coalition partners had resisted any suggestion of a delayed vote.
“When there is a possibility of preventing a civil war through dialogue, I, as the prime minister, take a time out for dialogue,” Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the delay.
It was unclear whether the delay would calm the protests. Israel’s main labor union called off a general strike after the announcement, but one protest group said it would keep demonstrating until the proposal was shelved.
Divisions: Critics fear the changes would remove checks and balances on the government and erode democracy. Supporters say the plan would curb an overreaching and unelected judicial bureaucracy. The fight has become a stand-in for a deeper ideological and cultural dispute.
Demonstrations: The protests have been going on for weeks. Netanyahu’s firing of the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who had cited growing unease in the military in his call for a halt to the process, set off intense demonstrations on Sunday. Protesters returned to the streets on Monday, blocking a major road in Tel Aviv. Here’s what it has looked like."
2023-03-28,"The Democratic Party has begun testing the use of artificial intelligence to write first drafts of some fund-raising messages, appeals that often perform better than those written entirely by human beings.
Fake A.I. images of Donald J. Trump getting arrested in New York spread faster than they could be fact-checked last week.
And voice-cloning tools are producing vividly lifelike audio of President Biden — and many others — saying things they did not actually say.
Artificial intelligence isn’t just coming soon to the 2024 campaign trail. It’s already here.
The swift advance of A.I. promises to be as disruptive to the political sphere as to broader society. Now any amateur with a laptop can manufacture the kinds of convincing sounds and images that were once the domain of the most sophisticated digital players. This democratization of disinformation is blurring the boundaries between fact and fake at a moment when the acceptance of universal truths — that Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump in 2020, for example — is already being strained.
And as synthetic media gets more believable, the question becomes: What happens when people can no longer trust their own eyes and ears?
Inside campaigns, artificial intelligence is expected to soon help perform mundane tasks that previously required fleets of interns. Republican and Democratic engineers alike are racing to develop tools to harness A.I. to make advertising more efficient, to engage in predictive analysis of public behavior, to write more and more personalized copy and to discover new patterns in mountains of voter data. The technology is evolving so fast that most predict a profound impact, even if specific ways in which it will upend the political system are more speculation than science."

Sergio Ermotti will return as C.E.O. of UBS on April 5.

A Swiss chief returns
UBS unexpectedly said on Wednesday that it was bringing back Sergio Ermotti as C.E.O., as the Swiss bank begins the tough task of digesting its archrival, Credit Suisse.
It’s another sign of how tricky UBS considers the work of taking over its main competitor, via a $3.2 billion deal that continues to draw blowback from investors and Swiss lawmakers alike.
The move had been in the works for days. Colm Kelleher, UBS’s chairman, said at a news conference that he first called Mr. Ermotti to discuss a potential return on March 20, less than a day after UBS announced it was buying Credit Suisse. Mr. Ermotti, who left UBS in 2020, will replace Ralph Hamers on April 5.
The UBS board determined that “for this massive integration exercise, Sergio would be the better pilot for the next part of this voyage,” Mr. Kelleher said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Hamers will stay on for an unspecified period as an adviser to help with the transition. At the news conference, Mr. Hamers — whose background is in retail banking, not investment banking or wealth management — said he understood that the Credit Suisse deal had changed things.
Mr. Ermotti helped revive UBS before. From 2011 to 2020, the Swiss banker led the firm’s effort to come back from its lows following the 2008 financial crisis, refocusing it on wealth management and scaling back riskier businesses in investment banking and trading. That — along with the years of scandals and missteps that have dogged Credit Suisse — made UBS the clearly larger and more stable of Switzerland’s two banking giants.
In seemingly prophetic comments, Mr. Ermotti told a Swiss newspaper in September that there was no “compelling” reason for Switzerland to have two banking giants.
But overseeing the integration of Credit Suisse will be more difficult. As Mr. Kelleher noted at the news conference, it’s the first deal that would combine two global systemically important banks. It will require shutting swaths of Credit Suisse’s investment bank and cutting probably hundreds of employees. Neither Mr. Kelleher nor Mr. Hamers would give a number on layoffs; as Mr. Hamers repeatedly emphasized at the news conference, the Credit Suisse deal was just announced a week and a half ago.
Success also requires shielding UBS’s culture against what Mr. Kelleher said were “clearly parts of Credit Suisse that had a bad culture,” alluding to the troubles that brought the smaller Swiss bank to its knees and prompted its fire sale. (Just out: Credit Suisse whistleblowers working with Senate investigators accused the Swiss firm of helping wealth Americans dodge U.S. taxes, violating a 2014 plea agreement with American prosecutors.)

UBS is also hoping to retain some Credit Suisse talent, and certainly prized clients — but competitors are hard at work snatching both. (Anke Reingen of RBC Capital Markets downgraded UBS today and expects a big loss of customers after the deal closes.) Nevertheless, UBS shares rose after Mr. Ermotti’s return was announced.

Jamie Dimon will reportedly testify in Jeffrey Epstein cases. JPMorgan Chase’s C.E.O. will give a sworn deposition in May, in connection with two lawsuits filed against the bank over its retaining the late sex offender as a client, according to The Financial Times. JPMorgan had tried to shield Mr. Dimon from having to testify; it has also sought to hold a former executive, Jes Staley, liable for any financial damages it incurs.
Howard Schultz will testify before the Senate. The former Starbucks C.E.O. will defend the coffee giant’s handling of union organizers: “Starbucks has engaged in good faith bargaining,” he will say according to his prepared testimony. Democratic lawmakers and labor activists have accused Starbucks of illegally seeking to block organizing efforts.
Germany examines Microsoft’s market power. Competition regulators are investigating whether the tech giant qualifies for closer antitrust scrutiny, as Alphabet, Amazon and Meta have. Microsoft was already facing regulatory pressure over its $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard.

Round 2 for banking regulators on Capitol Hill
Representatives of the nation’s top banking authorities — the F.D.I.C., the Fed and the Treasury Department — are set to testify before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. Eastern about the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.
If their appearance on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee was any indication, expect a grilling by lawmakers about how regulators missed numerous red flags at the lender whose implosion has set off a global banking crisis.
The Fed is in the firing line. Senators from both parties wanted to know why Silicon Valley Bank’s primary regulator didn’t do more to prevent its failure. Democrats pressed Michael Barr, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, on whether Trump-era lightening of banking regulation was to blame.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Republicans — who have been adamant that new regulations aren’t needed — criticized Fed banking examiners for missing warning signs, or failing to address them. Mr. Barr, a Biden appointee, suggested that the Fed would revisit rules that had been rolled back.
Mr. Barr also gave new details on Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. He testified the lender was set to suffer some $100 billion in withdrawals on March 10, after having already lost $42 billion in deposits, forcing the F.D.I.C. to take over the bank that morning.
Lawmakers and regulators emphasized punishments for bank executives. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee’s Democratic chair, who faces a tough re-election fight, said he planned to introduce legislation to stiffen penalties and introduce bans for executives at failed banks.
But while regulators said they were limited in their ability to claw back compensation, they emphasized that they can impose financial and other penalties if their investigations uncover wrongdoing.

Crypto’s unlikely rally
Crypto investors are sending digital asset prices higher this morning despite a wave of bad news slamming some of the sector’s biggest names, including new charges against the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
Binance has been hit by a run of withdrawals. Traders have pulled more than $2 billion out of the world’s biggest crypto exchange in the past week, according to The Wall Street Journal. Despite that, Binance coin, the firm’s in-house token, has climbed nearly 3 percent in the past day. (The company, which was founded by the crypto mogul Changpeng Zhao, has been prone to big outflows since the collapse of FTX.)
The latest exodus comes as the firm’s legal troubles mount. On Monday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a lawsuit in a Chicago federal court accusing Binance, Zhao and a former chief compliance officer of breaking derivatives trading rules. Another blow to Mr. Zhao’s ambitions: A federal judge temporarily blocked the $1.3 billion acquisition of Voyager Digital, a bankrupt crypto lender, by Binance’s U.S. unit.
And then federal prosecutors accused Mr. Bankman-Fried of bribing Chinese officials. In a new charge filed on Tuesday, they say he offered $40 million to unfreeze trading accounts for Alameda Research, FTX’s sister company. Mr. Bankman-Fried’s lengthy charge sheet already included securities fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violations, and he’s confined to his parents’ home in Palo Alto as he awaits trial.
Here’s what else is happening in crypto:
The F.D.I.C. has given Signature Bank’s crypto clients until April 5 to close their accounts and move their money out of the collapsed lender. Flagstar Bank, a unit of New York Community Bancorp, will buy the failed bank, but not its crypto-related deposits.
The authorities in Montenegro gave Bloomberg new details about Do Kwon, the fugitive crypto founder they arrested last week and continue to hold. He’s wanted in the U.S. and South Korea after the collapse of his Terra/Luna project. He and his traveling companion “told our officials that elsewhere in the world they had been used to V.I.P. treatment,” Interior Minister Filip Adzic said in an interview.

What Alibaba’s big breakup means
Markets welcomed Alibaba’s plan to split itself into six units: Its Hong Kong-traded shares rose sharply on Wednesday, and its New York-listed stock rose more than 14 percent after the news was announced a day earlier.
That reflects hopes that the company is out of the doghouse. Alibaba’s shares have fallen more than 70 percent since the autumn of 2020 when Jack Ma publicly criticized regulators and banks. Chinese officials subsequently launched a broader crackdown on the tech sector. Does the shake-up signal the end of Beijing’s squeeze on tech?
Alibaba’s overhaul is radical. Its new units — including e-commerce, artificial intelligence and digital media — could eventually pursue separate I.P.O.s or even be split off, diluting the overall power of the internet giant.
That will probably please regulators, who gave competition concerns as one reason to crack down on the company. (Alibaba presented its plan to government officials before announcing it, The Financial Times reports).
Image
Chinese tech investors overall may benefit. I.P.O.s of Alibaba divisions, or those of other tech giants that adopt similar plans, could bolster Hong Kong, whose reputation as a global financial center has been hammered by Beijing’s growing control of the semiautonomous city.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Chinese officials have pushed companies whose shares are listed abroad to shift to Hong Kong as part of a “homecoming push,” as Alibaba has already been preparing to do.
But big clouds remain. While Mr. Ma, who has largely stayed outside China since Beijing began cracking down on his companies, appeared in public in Hangzhou the day before Alibaba announced its plans, the strictly controlled event suggests he won’t do anything to irritate officials.
And the disappearance of another Chinese tech titan, the deal maker Bao Fan, is a reminder that Beijing’s close scrutiny of private enterprise is far from over.

This means it’s hard to invest in the U.S. stock market, such as through a 401(k) or pension plan, and not be highly dependent on the fate of the two tech giants. More than $15 trillion in assets, from pension funds and endowments to insurance companies, are linked to the performance of the S&P 500 index in some way, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, with more than 10 cents of every dollar allocated to the broad index flowing through to Microsoft’s and Apple’s market valuation.
It is a phenomenon explained by how the benchmark is constructed, and it is amplified by the way tech has come to dwarf other industries, in the markets and the economy. And it means that the two companies together can sway the direction of the broad market, sometimes masking turmoil that has taken place underneath.

Trading in March offers a clear example. Even after the failures of two regional banks in the United States and the rescue of a global investment bank in Europe sent a jolt through the financial system and raised new fears about an already fragile global economy, the S&P 500 ended the month up 3.5 percent.
Apple and Microsoft accounted for about half of that gain, according to data from S&P. Both were seemingly immune to the banking crisis and boosted by fervor over artificial intelligence, with Apple rising 11.4 percent during the month and Microsoft 15.6 percent.
It can be jarring for investors to see the index perform so differently from what they may have predicted, said Fiona Cincotta, a stock market analyst at StoneX, a brokerage.
“It’s phenomenal that two companies can direct so much power within the S&P 500,” she said. “These two companies seem to have been single-handedly directing the index.”
It was true even at the height of the frenzy. On Monday, March 13, immediately after the government seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, signs of panic were everywhere: Several regional banks suffered their worst day ever in the stock market, with First Republic Bank down more than 60 percent, in conditions so chaotic that trading in many individual stocks was halted as stock exchanges tried to limit the damage.

Outside the stock market, government bond yields went haywire, oil prices slid and the dollar weakened, all showing that alarms about the economy were ringing on trading desks around the world.
Yet the S&P 500 spent much of the day in positive territory, and it ended with a barely noticeable decline of 0.1 percent. Credit, again, goes to Microsoft and Apple, which both rose enough to counter a 15 percent slide in the entire regional banking sector that day.
Much of this comes down to how the S&P 500 is designed. Its value is calculated by a measure that considers the overall market capitalization of a company. It means the stock moves of the largest companies carry the greatest weight, because even slight changes in their value create or destroy billions of dollars of shareholder value.
As one of 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500, the tech industry accounts for more than a quarter of the stock index’s value.

Apple, at roughly $2.4 trillion, and Microsoft, at $2.1 trillion, are so large that, taken together, the two companies would be the third-largest sector of the index, behind tech and health care. They would be larger than the energy sector and roughly the size of the financials sector.

This influence is a result of a decades-long shift in both the markets and the economy since the dot-com boom, a change that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Low interest rates put in place to support the economy after the Great Recession made borrowing cheap and pushed investors to seek out higher returns from riskier companies, spurring financing and growth for tech companies. Apple and Microsoft excelled.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Apple in 2018 became the first American company valued at more than $1 trillion on the stock market. As its value inflated, so did that of its rivals Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) — a group that came to be called the FANG stocks. They helped to lift the index to new highs over a more than decade-long bull market. Since then, Apple and Microsoft have become proportionally much larger, more than twice the size of the next largest company.
This dynamic is not wholly unusual in the history of the S&P 500, though it is extreme, and it has been exacerbated by the rapid growth of some tech companies through the pandemic. (At the end of 2018, Microsoft’s and Apple’s combined index weight was less than Apple’s is today on its own.) The previous company to reach Microsoft’s 6.2 percent weight in the index was IBM in the mid-80s, based on data for the end of each calendar year.
“I don’t think it’s a problem,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “This is what the whole thing is worth, and if Apple or Microsoft go up or down, there is proportional impact because they are worth more. It’s market-driven.”
The S&P also produces an “equal weight” index, where each stock has the same effect on the wider group. In March, that index fell 2.6 percent.

Another commonly cited measure of Wall Street’s performance, the Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index that has been criticized for how it emphasizes companies based on their share price alone.
And then there are the underlying sectors, which are also tracked in separate indexes by S&P. These indexes, which tend to more directly show pain afflicting their subsets of stocks, show that the financial sector fell almost 10 percent in March, while energy stocks dropped 0.5 percent and real estate companies slid 2.1 percent. They also show that other parts of the market — like utilities — fared just fine.
“There were so many sectors that underperformed and were in the red across the month, and that was completely pushed over and overshadowed by the gains in big tech,” Ms. Cincotta said.
S&P Dow Jones Indices, which maintains the S&P 500 as well as the Dow, has tried to address the impact of these specific weightings, at least on different sectors. In 2018, it moved Alphabet and Meta out of the tech sector and into the communications category with Netflix, while leaving Amazon in the consumer discretionary category with other retailers.
Since then, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have slowly lost value, while Apple and Microsoft have grown. The technology sector in the S&P 500 has also been bolstered by the emergence of new behemoths like the chip maker Nvidia, which is valued around three quarters of a trillion dollars.

This month, S&P sought to rebalance the index again, moving a handful of large tech-oriented companies — like Visa and PayPal — into the financials sector, but further entrenching Apple and Microsoft’s dominance as the two tech heavyweights.
Of course, this cuts both ways. In 2022, the S&P 500 slumped close to 20 percent, a drop that would have been much smaller without the lousy performance of the tech sector. Apple and Microsoft together accounted for roughly one-fifth of the index’s total decline last year.
But for now, analysts see reasons for tech to continue to rally.
One reason is the excitement over artificial intelligence. Microsoft has a large stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and many investors foresee the nascent technology driving the next phase of growth for the companies developing the software as well as the chip makers whose processors power it.
Tech stocks are also benefiting from the concern over the country’s banks, which has led investors to quickly cut back their expectation for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The sector is particularly sensitive to interest rates, and absent an imminent recession, lower rates in the future would be a boost for the sector.
And, analysts said, large technology companies have become havens where investors can wait out the current storm.
“It’s been a big bull cycle for tech,” said George Catrambone, the head of Americas trading at DWS, a fund manager. “I don’t think people will give up that paradigm easily.”"

2023-04-04,"Ian Sansavera, a software architect at a New York start-up called Runway AI, typed a short description of what he wanted to see in a video. “A tranquil river in the forest,” he wrote.
Less than two minutes later, an experimental internet service generated a short video of a tranquil river in a forest. The river’s running water glistened in the sun as it cut between trees and ferns, turned a corner and splashed gently over rocks.
Runway, which plans to open its service to a small group of testers this week, is one of several companies building artificial intelligence technology that will soon let people generate videos simply by typing several words into a box on a computer screen.
They represent the next stage in an industry race — one that includes giants like Microsoft and Google as well as much smaller start-ups — to create new kinds of artificial intelligence systems that some believe could be the next big thing in technology, as important as web browsers or the iPhone.
The new video-generation systems could speed the work of moviemakers and other digital artists, while becoming a new and quick way to create hard-to-detect online misinformation, making it even harder to tell what’s real on the internet.
The systems are examples of what is known as generative A.I., which can instantly create text, images and sounds. Another example is ChatGPT, the online chatbot made by a San Francisco start-up, OpenAI, that stunned the tech industry with its abilities late last year.

1. U.S. job growth gradually slowed — but remains strong — a welcome sign for President Biden and the Fed.
Employment grew at a healthy rate last month, but one that nonetheless signified that employers are pulling back as steadily rising interest rates take their toll.
Job creation has remained far stronger than many forecasters expected. That growth has delighted President Biden and helped the economy avoid a recession. The cooling in job and wage growth is also good news for the Federal Reserve in its campaign to bring down inflation by raising interest rates.
However, some analysts are not convinced that it will be smooth sailing in the months ahead. The job data was collected before two midsize banks failed last month, and some have warned about the potential for a rapid deceleration in hiring as banks pull back on lending.

2. The Pentagon is investigating the leak of classified documents detailing secret plans for the war in Ukraine.
The documents, which were posted this week on social media, contain American and NATO plans for building up the Ukrainian military ahead of a planned offensive against Russian troops, Biden administration officials said. The Pentagon has launched an investigation to identify the source of the leak, which contained photographs of charts of anticipated weapons deliveries, troop and battalion strengths, and other plans.
Military analysts said the documents appear to have been modified — overstating American estimates of Ukrainian war dead and understating estimates of Russian troops killed — which could point to a disinformation effort by Moscow. Officials in both Russia and Ukraine cast doubt on the leak, suggesting that it could have been a ploy by the other side.

3. Donald Trump is betting that his presidential campaign can help his criminal case.
As he faces the first-ever criminal prosecution of a former president, Trump is planning to blur the lines between his legal and political battles, according to his aides and allies. His strategy is to paint himself as a victim of Democratic persecution and generate enough support to win his acquittal, deter other prosecutors from seeking additional indictments and boost his campaign.
Trump’s lawyers have told him that his plan is unlikely to work, and there seems to be little upside to any indictment. Still, Trump is already trying to capitalize on the case: His campaign is selling T-shirts that read “I STAND WITH TRUMP” and have the date 03-30-2023 — the day he was indicted.

4. Israel bombarded Lebanon in retaliation for a barrage of rocket attacks.
Israeli warplanes struck three sites overnight in Lebanon that the military said were controlled by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, in retaliation for a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon across Israel’s northern border. The exchange was seen as the most serious escalation along the border in more than 15 years.
Much of the fighting had subsided by Friday morning, and all sides appeared intent on containing the cross-border violence. But the attacks raised fears of a wider conflict as frictions in Israel have steadily climbed over the last week. On Wednesday, the Israeli police raided a mosque in Jerusalem after Palestinians barricaded themselves inside.

5. New car rules are designed to be so tough that carmakers will have to turn to electric vehicles.
As early as next week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to propose an ambitious set of restrictions on vehicle tailpipe pollution. The standards are set to be intentionally onerous in an effort to ensure that at least half of the new vehicles sold in the U.S. are all-electric by 2030. The rules could also put the nation on track to end sales of new gasoline-powered cars as soon as 2035.
Today, just 5.8 percent of cars sold are all-electric. Scientists say that quickly slashing pollution from tailpipes is essential for averting the most catastrophic impacts of global warming.

Employees at the normally risk-adverse companies warned against launching their respective A.I. tools, arguing the technology was still too inaccurate and could erode the factual foundation of modern society. But Microsoft and Google released their chatbots anyway, driven by a race to control what could be the tech industry’s next big thing.
Researchers said Microsoft and Google were taking risks by releasing technology that even its developers don’t entirely understand. But the companies said that they had built sophisticated filtering systems to weed out hate speech and content that could cause obvious harm.

Now that Covid restrictions have been all but eliminated, the music industry’s biggest stars are performing in packed arenas around the world. Fans of Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Drake and more have a chance to see them perform this year. But it’s not going to be cheap.

April 8, 2023
Seeing has not been believing for a very long time. Photos have been faked and manipulated for nearly as long as photography has existed.
Now, not even reality is required for photographs to look authentic — just artificial intelligence responding to a prompt. Even experts sometimes struggle to tell if one is real or not. Can you?
Which image was created by artificial intelligence? Click on your guess
The rapid advent of artificial intelligence has set off alarms that the technology used to trick people is advancing far faster than the technology that can identify the tricks. Tech companies, researchers, photo agencies and news organizations are scrambling to catch up, trying to establish standards for content provenance and ownership.
The advancements are already fueling disinformation and being used to stoke political divisions. Authoritarian governments have created seemingly realistic news broadcasters to advance their political goals. Last month, some people fell for images showing Pope Francis donning a puffy Balenciaga jacket and an earthquake devastating the Pacific Northwest, even though neither of those events had occurred. The images had been created using Midjourney, a popular image generator.
On Tuesday, as former President Donald J. Trump turned himself in at the Manhattan district attorney’s office to face criminal charges, images generated by artificial intelligence appeared on Reddit showing the actor Bill Murray as president in the White House. Another image showing Mr. Trump marching in front of a large crowd with American flags in the background was quickly reshared on Twitter without the disclosure that had accompanied the original post, noting it was not actually a photograph.

2023-04-13,"Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a harsh critic of former President Donald J. Trump, has helped pay for a lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, the New York magazine writer who sued Mr. Trump for rape and defamation, according to newly filed court papers in the case.
Mr. Hoffman’s support for Ms. Carroll’s lawsuit, which was first disclosed in a letter to a judge on Thursday by Mr. Trump’s lawyers, has sparked a sharp dispute in the case, which is scheduled for trial in federal court in Manhattan on April 25.
Mr. Trump’s lawyers, writing to the judge, accused Ms. Carroll of concealing Mr. Hoffman’s role, which they said they only learned of this week from her lawyers. They said the disclosure raised “significant questions” about Ms. Carroll’s credibility and whether her allegations against Mr. Trump were, as he has claimed, a “hoax” brought “to advance a political agenda.”
They asked for a one-month postponement so they could investigate the funding issue. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, on Thursday evening said he would allow Mr. Trump’s lawyers the opportunity to conduct a narrow inquiry into the funding issue, but he declined to delay the case.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ms. Carroll’s lawyers in their own letter argued that the financial support was irrelevant to Ms. Carroll’s legal claims and that she had nothing to do with obtaining the outside funding and no dealings with anyone associated with the nonprofit.
They noted that it was not until September 2020, almost a year after Ms. Carroll filed the first of what became two lawsuits against Mr. Trump, that their firm obtained the funding to help pay “certain costs and fees.”
They said Mr. Trump’s effort to delay the trial — earlier this week he asked that it be delayed because of a “deluge of prejudicial media coverage” concerning his recent criminal indictment in New York — was “his latest transparent effort to keep a jury from deciding Carroll’s claims.”
Mr. Hoffman is a billionaire tech entrepreneur known for cofounding LinkedIn, which went public in 2011 and sold to Microsoft for $26 billion in 2016. He has a long history of funding Democratic candidates and causes, including those specifically designed to counteract Mr. Trump’s influence.
Dmitri Mehlhorn, a philanthropic adviser for Mr. Hoffman, said in a statement that since 2017 they have acted as “third-party funders who support people in obtaining their legal rights.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Trump and his defenders keep trying to change the subject, because they don’t want a neutral court of law to evaluate his behavior,” Mr. Mehlhorn said.
He added that they had made an earlier grant through a nonprofit to support a different public interest lawsuit being handled by the firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink, which later took up Ms. Carroll’s case. He said that later, in September 2020, Ms. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, asked if money from that grant could be used for Ms. Carroll’s suit.
“We had no prior knowledge at the time of the original grant that our funding would go to support her case in particular,” Mr. Mehlhorn said.
Mr. Mehlhorn declined to specify the size of the original grant.
Mr. Hoffman is part of the so-called PayPal Mafia, a network of well-connected tech executives and investors who got their start at the payments company in the late 1990s. That crew includes the tech mogul Peter Thiel, who is a prominent Republican donor and has secretly funded lawsuits. In 2016 Mr. Thiel paid $10 million for the wrestler Hulk Hogan to sue the media outlet Gawker Media for an invasion of privacy, ultimately leading to Gawker’s bankruptcy.
In New York and elsewhere, there is a well-established financial industry in which outsiders invest in lawsuits, whether involving car accidents, contract claims or mere slip-and-fall cases, said Anthony Sebok, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and expert on litigation finance and legal ethics.

Professor Sebok added that there was nothing wrong, legally or ethically, with an outsider who has no connection to a plaintiff providing funding to a lawsuit after it is filed, “either to make money or just because they have a rooting interest in the outcome.”

The clash over Mr. Hoffman’s role is just the latest twist in litigation stemming from the allegation by Ms. Carroll, a former Elle magazine columnist. In a 2019 book and excerpt in New York magazine, she accused Mr. Trump of pushing her against a dressing room wall in the luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan in the mid-1990s, saying he then pulled down her tights, opened his pants and forced himself upon her.
Mr. Trump denied her accusation, saying he had never met Ms. Carroll, that she was “totally lying” and that he could not have raped her because she was not his “type.”
Ms. Carroll, saying Mr. Trump’s comments had damaged her reputation, sued him in 2019 for defamation. She sued him again last year — this time accusing him of rape — under a new state law in New York that grants adults a one-time window to sue those who they say abused them even if the statute of limitations has long expired.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It is that lawsuit that is scheduled for trial this month.
The original defamation case has been tangled in appeals. On Thursday, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals — a local court akin to a state’s supreme court — issued a 41-page ruling that declined to decide whether Mr. Trump was acting in his capacity as president when he made the disparaging comments.
The ruling was a partial victory for Ms. Carroll because the defamation lawsuit will continue, and because the D.C. court laid out for New York judges a detailed explanation about when an employer can be held liable for the actions of an employee — an explanation that appears favorable to Ms. Carroll.
After Ms. Carroll sued Mr. Trump for defamation, the Justice Department intervened under a law that substitutes the government as the defendant when federal officials are sued for official acts — meaning a case must be dismissed. That raised the question of whether Mr. Trump was acting as president when he talked about Ms. Carroll.
In October 2020, Judge Kaplan rejected the Justice Department’s attempt to substitute the government as the defendant, ruling that Mr. Trump’s comments had “no relationship to the official business of the United States.” But a higher court asked the D.C. Court of Appeals to decide whether Mr. Trump was acting as a private person or as an employee of the federal government.
Had the D.C. court ruled in favor of Mr. Trump, that would have effectively brought an end to the defamation case. But it balked, saying there were not yet enough facts in the record to make that determination.

2023-04-14,"It’s awfully hard to beat the stock market consistently. In 2022, despite many advantages, most mutual funds couldn’t do it. There are important lessons in that failure for this year and beyond.
Recall that the S&P 500 declined 19.4 percent last year. It was a miserable time for just about anyone who held stocks, including those who merely tried to match the overall market, as I do, using broadly diversified, low-cost index funds.
But beneath the market’s surface last year, there were plenty of opportunities that should have given active stock pickers a competitive advantage over index funds. That’s because the average stock did better than the overall market, which was heavily influenced by a relative handful of “megacap” tech stocks like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These giants declined sharply, but the rest of the market did markedly better.
That meant the odds actually favored stock pickers last year. They had plenty of companies to choose from, any one of which would have given them a better performance than the overall market. And, in fact, as a group, actively managed mutual funds fared better against the overall market average than they have since 2009.
Even so, the average actively managed stock mutual fund failed to beat the S&P 500. In an interview, Anu R. Ganti, senior director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, summarized that mediocre performance this way. “Actively managed funds underperformed less badly in 2022 than they have in most years,” she said. “But they still underperformed.”
Tailwinds Helped, but Not Much
In some respects, the failure of actively managed mutual funds to beat the broad market indexes last year is unsurprising. S&P Dow Jones Indices has been running systematic comparisons of actively managed funds and passively managed funds — a.k.a. index funds — since 2001.

That’s where the government comes in — or so they hope.
A place to start is with the frameworks policymakers have already put forward to govern A.I. The two major proposals, at least in the West, are the “Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights,” which the White House put forward in 2022, and the Artificial Intelligence Act, which the European Commission proposed in 2021. Then, last week, China released its latest regulatory approach.
Let’s start with the European proposal, as it came first. The Artificial Intelligence Act tries to regulate A.I. systems according to how they’re used. It is particularly concerned with high-risk uses, which include everything from overseeing critical infrastructure to grading papers to calculating credit scores to making hiring decisions. High-risk uses, in other words, are any use in which a person’s life or livelihood might depend on a decision made by a machine-learning algorithm.
The European Commission described this approach as “future-proof,” which proved to be predictably arrogant, as new A.I. systems have already thrown the bill’s clean definitions into chaos. Focusing on use cases is fine for narrow systems designed for a specific use, but it’s a category error when it’s applied to generalized systems. Models like GPT-4 don’t do any one thing except predict the next word in a sequence. You can use them to write code, pass the bar exam, draw up contracts, create political campaigns, plot market strategy and power A.I. companions or sexbots. In trying to regulate systems by use case, the Artificial Intelligence Act ends up saying very little about how to regulate the underlying model that’s powering all these use cases.
Unintended consequences abound. The A.I.A. mandates, for example, that in high-risk cases, “training, validation and testing data sets shall be relevant, representative, free of errors and complete.” But what the large language models are showing is that the most powerful systems are those trained on the largest data sets. Those sets can’t plausibly be free of error, and it’s not clear what it would mean for them to be representative. There’s a strong case to be made for data transparency, but I don’t think Europe intends to deploy weaker, less capable systems across everything from exam grading to infrastructure.

Does Rupert Murdoch want to settle?

Mary Altaffer/Associated Press
A last-minute push to avert a trial of the century
Monday was to be the start of the biggest defamation trial in recent American history — but opening proceedings in Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox News over on-air remarks about the 2020 election were delayed by a day.
The presiding judge is expected to make an announcement at 9 a.m. Eastern, but several news outlets reported that Fox was seeking an out-of-court settlement. Rupert Murdoch’s media colossus has good reason to do: The trial will air the private exchanges of executives and on-air hosts, among the most influential in television news — and there’s a lot of money on the line.
Fox made an 11th-hour push to reach a deal, according to reports, with both sides expected to meet on Monday to try to negotiate a last-minute truce. The companies had previously participated in mediation talks in December, to no avail.
Defamation cases rarely reach a jury: Just three did so in 2017, David Logan of the Roger Williams School of Law told The Times, compared with an average of 27 annually in the 1980s.

Fox has suffered an array of setbacks. The presiding judge in the case recently ruled that the network can’t contest that it had broadcast false statements about Dominion that were harmful to the voting machine maker — only whether it had knowingly made false statements or was reckless in deciding to air them, a standard known as actual malice.
The judge has also ruled that Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the C.E.O. of Fox Corp., could be compelled to testify live during the trial. Other likely witnesses include the Fox News hosts Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro, as well as the former host Lou Dobbs (Fox News and Dobbs recently settled a separate defamation suit linked to voting-system fraud); the Fox executives Suzanne Scott and Viet Dinh; and Paul Ryan, the former House speaker and a current Fox board member.
Dominion still has a high legal bar to clear. Demonstrating actual malice will be difficult: While internal communications show that Fox executives and commentators dismissed the anti-Dominion claims being made on air, the network’s lawyers say broadcasts were protected by the First Amendment.
But while legal scholars generally side with media outlets in these kinds of cases, many say the evidence against Fox is unusually strong. “This is about as strong as a case you’re going to get on defamation,” John Culhane of the Delaware Law School at Widener University told The Times.

Fox could be on the hook for a lot of money if it loses, though perhaps not the full $1.6 billion that Dominion had once sought. The voting machine maker has signaled that it won’t seek claims for lost profits, which it had previously indicated were at least $600 million.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Group of 7 countries agree to speed up the end of fossil-fuel use. Climate and energy ministers concluded two days of negotiations in Japan on Sunday, pledging to “accelerate the phaseout of unabated fossil fuels” to meet net-zero targets. But they didn’t act on a push by Canada to set a deadline for shutting down coal-fired power plants.
SpaceX prepares to test a rocket for the history books. Elon Musk’s company is set to launch a prototype of its Starship craft, the most powerful rocket ever, as soon as Monday morning. A lot is riding on the test: The 394-foot-tall rocket is expected to send NASA astronauts to the moon this decade, and eventually to Mars.
Executive pay rises at many U.S. companies despite falling share prices. Over a third of S&P 500 corporations — including Boeing, Marriott and Moderna — increased compensation for their leaders last year over 2021, despite disappointing shareholder returns, according to The Financial Times.
Netflix’s second foray into live programming suffers a delay. The streaming giant’s effort to air a live reunion episode of “Love Is Blind” was pushed back an hour — and was finally broadcast after being recorded — because of what the company said was “an issue with the livestream.” TV competitors snarked on the situation, as did Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Smaller banks in the spotlight
Friday’s blowout earnings by JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo were a welcome sign that America’s biggest banks appear to have emerged unscathed from the downfall of Silicon Valley Bank. But the real test starts this week with a bevy of smaller banks reporting results that are expected to give Wall Street and Washington key insights into whether the financial crisis is truly behind us.
M&T Bank was the first out of the gates on Monday morning, with the lender reporting a better than expected profit, pushing its share price up nearly 3 percent in premarket trading.

Regional banks remain under pressure. The good news: The exodus of deposits has been broadly contained. The bad: The stock prices of midsize lenders have tanked in the past month, and ratings agencies are on the watch. (Fitch cut PacWest to junk last week after it lost 20 percent of its deposits.) At the same time, banks are under pressure to offer bigger deposit rates to keep customers from fleeing.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Interest rates are driving up the cost of capital. Meanwhile, President Biden is urging smaller banks to keep more cash and long-term debt on their balance sheets. Such a move could cause lenders to flood the public market with efforts to raise more debt, and jack up debt prices even higher. Such a cycle of rising debt costs is a big point of stress for the banks, DealBook hears.
A continuing standoff is stifling deals. With equity at rock bottom, banks are wary of raising money or selling. On the other end, prospective buyers are unwilling to swallow a huge loss, absent either a huge price cut or a government-brokered arrangement on sharing losses. Banks may be wary of selling for other reasons, particularly in cases where management owns a large amount of depressed stock, and/or it has taken out loans against that stock when it was worth much more.
DealBook was told to expect that banks will try to work a range of deals, including offloading assets and raising debt. There could be movement on the latter once they have announced their latest financial results. Also, if a big merger happens without government support, expect others to follow suit.

How Google is rethinking search
ChatGPT and other chatbots pose the biggest threat to Google’s dominant search business, worth $162 billion last year, in more than two decades. But that became more alarming to the company in March, when Samsung began weighing replacing Google as the default search engine on its devices with Microsoft’s Bing, putting a contract worth an estimated $3 billion annually at risk.
The Times’s Nico Grant reports on how more than 160 Google employees are working to revamp the tech titan’s chief moneymaker in an age of A.I. tools, under the project name Magi:
The system would learn what users want to know based on what they’re searching when they begin using it. And it would offer lists of preselected options for objects to buy, information to research and other information. It would also be more conversational — a bit like chatting with a helpful person. …
Magi would keep ads in the mix of search results. Search queries that could lead to a financial transaction, such as buying shoes or booking a flight, for example, would still feature ads on their results pages.
Google plans to start rolling out Magi features next month to a select few users in the U.S. and up to 30 million people by the end of the year.

Goldman Sachs shares fell as much as 4 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday.

Big banks show their strength
Bank of America reported on Tuesday that deposits fell less than analysts had expected last quarter, and BNY Mellon reported a slight increase in deposits, pushing their shares up in premarket trading as investors see more evidence that the country’s biggest lenders grew stronger after Silicon Valley Bank’s demise last month.
A major outlier: Goldman Sachs, which reported revenues that came in below Wall Street’s forecasts, booked a $470 million loss on efforts to sell loans connected with its struggling Marcus consumer banking unit. Its stock fell nearly 4 percent lower in premarket.
The outlook is far cloudier for smaller banks. State Street, M&T Bank and Charles Schwab on Monday reported nearly $60 billion in deposit outflows last quarter. State Street’s shares fell more than 9 percent on Monday, its worst single-day performance in three years. Schwab halted its stock buyback plans, citing market uncertainty.
Banks are under pressure to raise interest rates to stem the deposit exodus. About $12 billion in deposits left State Street last quarter as customers sought higher rates elsewhere, according to Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
Per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the average savings deposit account at a U.S. bank pays out 0.37 percent in interest. That looks miserly, especially after the Fed raised up the federal funds rate to nearly 5 percent over the past year: The gap between the Fed’s prime lending rate and the average deposit rate has reached a multidecade high.
Look for rivals to exploit that gap. Apple and Goldman Sachs on Monday announced a savings account that pays 4.15 percent in interest. Goldman’s Marcus offers a savings account with a 3.9 percent interest rate.

When Mr. Maxon steps inside and pulls a lever, the entire two-story structure pulls away from his house in Carnation, Wash., and rolls down a 110-foot-long track — his own personal railroad.
“There’s a detachment to literally leaving the house,” said Mr. Maxon, 48, a creative director who has worked in branding and marketing for clients including Lexus, Microsoft and Lego, and who previously had a connected home office where he struggled with distractions.
Beyond the peace and quiet, the mobility of the building allows him to take in inspiring views. “There are different moments along the rail,” he said. “If you take it halfway, that’s where our fire pit is. If you take it all the way out, you move from being open to being really in the woods, where the light is just different.”

When Lou Maxon, a creative director, is ready to begin his workday, he drives his studio along a 110-foot-long track in Carnation, Wash. Tom Kundig, a founder of the architecture firm Olson Kundig, designed the trainlike home office after listening to Mr. Maxon describe his desire for a place free of distractions.

Built from weathering steel and glass, with a metal door finished in bright yellow automotive paint, the studio measures just under 300 square feet. It was designed by Tom Kundig, the architect who founded the Seattle-based firm Olson Kundig. Known for its buildings with moving parts — from hand-cranked glass walls to camping huts mounted on enormous casters — the firm actually has a staff member with the job title of gizmologist: Phil Turner, who specializes in making some of Mr. Kundig’s more audacious ideas reality."
2023-04-21,"Lyft, which has struggled financially while trying to compete with its rival, Uber, said on Friday that it was planning major job cuts.
The layoffs, which are expected next week, will affect about 1,200 people, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. It is the first significant move by David Risher, the company’s new chief executive. Mr. Risher had been considering the cuts for several weeks, the person said, even though his first official day as the company’s C.E.O. was on Monday.
“We need to bring our costs down to deliver affordable rides, compelling earnings for drivers and profitable growth,” Mr. Risher said in a note to employees. He added that money saved from the downsizing would be used to “invest in competitive pricing, faster pick-up times and better driver earnings.”
Mr. Risher said that employees would be notified next Thursday if they had lost their jobs, and that Lyft offices would be closed that day.

News of the job cuts at Lyft, which has about 4,000 employees, was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
“This is a hard decision, and one we’re not making lightly,” Sona Iliffe-Moon, a Lyft spokeswoman, said in a statement. “But the result will be a far stronger, more competitive Lyft.”
Lyft announced in March that Mr. Risher, a former Amazon and Microsoft executive who served on Lyft’s board, would take over for John Zimmer and Logan Green, the company’s founders. Both men are leaving their executive positions but staying at the company as members of the board.
Lyft has long been a distant second to Uber, which has emerged from the pandemic in a stronger position, partly because of its investment in food delivery and a global ride-hailing business.
In November, Lyft laid off 13 percent of its staff. In February, the company reported record revenue but warned it would be slowed by economic challenges as it worked to lower prices. Mr. Risher has said that keeping prices competitive will be a key part of his strategy to differentiate Lyft from Uber.

Business consultants had been brought in to ask departments to justify their budgets and make cost-cutting recommendations, three current and former employees said, and company executives had been hinting throughout the spring that more workers could lose their jobs.

2023-04-24,"LOS ANGELES — Jorge Mendez waited impatiently as the Los Angeles Kings’ fate hung in the balance late Friday night.
Their N.H.L. first-round playoff game against the Edmonton Oilers had already gone into overtime, robbing Mendez’s crew of several precious minutes they would need to get Crypto.com Arena ready for the Clippers’ N.B.A. playoff game on Saturday afternoon. And now there was another delay. Officials were trying to determine whether a would-be game-winning goal by Kings forward Trevor Moore should count.
Mendez, the venue’s assistant conversion manager, had a crew of about 20 people waiting to transform the chilly arena. They would be working all night and had to finish by 7 a.m. Saturday. They had never missed a deadline, and weren’t about to start now.
“With the referees we don’t know,” Mendez said. “They could say they deny that one and it goes longer. And the more longer they go, they’re going to take more time from me.”

The Kings had a playoff game Friday night, and the Clippers and Lakers hosted postseason games Saturday, creating an eventful weekend for arena workers.
The goal stood and the Kings won. Fans celebrated and left the building, then Mendez’s crew got to work: The nets and glass surrounding the ice rink came down; the penalty boxes and benches were disassembled and moved; the ice was cleaned and covered by insulation so it wouldn’t melt during the next day’s basketball games; and the modules containing seats were shifted into new configurations.
They finished well before 7 a.m. and Mendez drove home at 6:30 a.m. At that time of day there is little traffic, so it took him just 10 minutes. When he works overnight, he sleeps during the day, and his wife tries to stop his 9-year-old daughter from bursting into his room to ask if he wants to bike with her. But Mendez’s weekend was long from over.
Like dozens of others, Mendez worked tirelessly to make sure the arena could handle its frenetic week. The busiest time came in the 36 hours after the Kings game Friday, when the building turned over from the Kings to the Clippers to the Lakers and back to the Kings. All three teams have called the arena home since 1999, when it opened as Staples Center.
“My favorite part of this is when they’re done,” said Lee Zeidman, the president of Crypto.com Arena; the nearby Microsoft Theater; and the surrounding entertainment district, L.A. Live. “It’s like a puzzle. These men and women they’re the best in the business.”

‘Organized chaos’
Between Thursday and Monday night, Crypto.com Arena will have hosted four basketball playoff games and two hockey playoff games.

“It’s chaos,” said Darryl Jackson, an event operations assistant manager for the arena. “But it’s organized. Organized chaos.” He began his career working on conversions, but now helps to make sure the baskets during basketball games and the glass during hockey games stay in good condition.
Minutes after Game 4 of the first-round series between the Clippers and the Phoenix Suns finished Saturday, Loreto Verdugo backed a forklift down an aisle between the court and the first row of grandstand seats. He had just a couple of inches of space on either side of him. After years of doing this task, he wasn’t nearly as nervous as he was the first time he did it.
“You don’t want to hit the floor because the floor’s the most important thing out there,” Verdugo said. “But you don’t want to hit anybody else either.”
He had quietly left his home in North Hollywood at 4 a.m. (“I’m like a mouse,” he said) to be at the arena in time to begin supervising maintenance work.
As soon as the Clippers’ game ended, just before 3 p.m., and all of the people had been cleared from the court, a bustle of expertly choreographed activity began. By the time the Clippers’ players began their postgame interviews, workers had bagged fans’ trash, and the player and logo banners the Clippers hang in the rafters had been rolled up to reveal the gold-colored championship banners for the Lakers and the W.N.B.A.’s Los Angeles Sparks, who have also shared the arena for much of the past two decades.

The Kings won in overtime Friday against the Edmonton Oilers before the Clippers lost to the Phoenix Suns and the Lakers beat the Memphis Grizzlies.
The Clippers’ court was already being uprooted from the floor, piece by interlocking piece, and loaded onto pallets that Verdugo and two other forklift drivers would pick up and deposit in a storage area that doubles as a news conference room.
It was the 251st midday conversion in the history of Crypto.com Arena.
About an hour after the Clippers’ game ended, their court had been replaced by the Lakers’ floor.
Joe Keeler, who normally drives the Zamboni that cleans and builds the ice during hockey games, joined a group of people folding the baskets with white stanchions that the Clippers use and rolling them out to the storage area. They replaced them with the yellow-stanchioned baskets the Lakers use.
“Everybody helps where they can,” said Keeler, who also helped pick up the Clippers’ floor and lay down the Lakers’.

Red Clippers drapery was replaced by purple, and a purple carpet had been rolled out in the tunnel the Lakers use to go onto the court.
It is a little easier when the conversion is from one basketball court to another. Doubleheaders involving the Kings are more challenging. When the building first opened, Zeidman gathered the vendors for the basketball courts, the seats and the plexiglass for hockey games and asked them how long they thought it would take to convert the hockey arena into a basketball arena. They told him at least four hours.
“Unacceptable,” Zeidman said.

Robbin Dedeaux, a seasoned usher, worked his section during the Clippers’ game before the changeover. The court and banners, like the Lakers and Sparks’ championship banners, are adjusted accordingly.
‘How can I work here?’
The first conversion for a doubleheader was an event in itself. Fans were allowed to watch from a designated area. Arena workers watched from a break room upstairs.

“It was amazing,” said Juanita Williams, 57, an usher who has worked right behind the home benches during basketball games since the building opened. “To see it for the first time, we were like there’s no way they’re going to change this over in two and a half hours. It happened.”
Williams started as an usher 25 years ago at the Forum in Inglewood, Calif., where the Lakers and the Kings played from 1967 to 1999. She called to find out how much Lakers season tickets cost.
“I said: ‘OK, I cannot afford those tickets. So how can I work here then?’” she said.
In the daytime she works from home as a buyer for a washer and dryer company that she has been with for 34 years. Her daughter briefly took a job as an usher, too, while going to cosmetology school.
By Monday night, Williams will have worked in all six playoff games since Thursday.
The merchandise available on arena concourses must be refreshed, too.

Robbin Dedeaux, 65, will have too. He works at the top of the lower bowl in aisle 14, checking tickets and greeting customers. He is stationed right next to where the Lakers’ radio broadcasters sit.
Dedeaux also started this work as a second job to get out of the list of chores his wife, Ricca Dedeaux, was always asking him to do. He started with ticket-taking in 1999 and then became an usher. He has been asked if he’d like to work down on the floor, but he thinks he might get sleepy if he got to sit down.
“The fans are the best part of the job,” Dedeaux said. “You get to see them from all over the world. They come in from Italy, they come in from France, they come in from Germany. You have fun with them.”
He added: “When the fans that come here from different arenas, I have fun with them. I tell them to get out.”
He laughed.
Dedeaux and his wife have been married for 40 years. He said she misses him during basketball and hockey season when he is working so many hours.

‘It has to be done’
Ignacio Guerra’s first job in the events world came in the early 1990s. He was a high school chemistry and biology teacher and coach, and he would park cars at the Hollywood Bowl in the summers. When Staples Center opened, Guerra worked for the contractor parking cars there, before finding a job working for the arena. Saturday was his 21st anniversary with the arena.
In 2019, he took over as the head of the arena’s operations department. He is now the senior vice president of operations and engineering. He has worked hundreds of events and has two large frames in his office displaying credentials for everything from Taylor Swift concerts to N.B.A. All-Star Games.
He shepherded the building through coronavirus shutdowns and the return of fans. During the shutdown, many of his workers took other jobs and didn’t come back, which meant starting over with new people at some positions.

Kings and Lakers fans celebrated victories while the Clippers fell further behind in their playoff series.
At least a handful of the remaining people have worked at the arena since the beginning, including the man who builds the penalty boxes for hockey games. Guerra often stands in the middle of the floor supervising all of the activity.
“They’re the heart and soul of this,” Guerra said of the operations staff.
He said the crew has never missed a conversion.

“You can’t wait up at 7 in the morning and say, ‘Hey, sorry we couldn’t get the Laker floor down.’” Guerra said. “It has to be down, and there’s a no-fail mentality.”

2023-04-25,"Microsoft’s cloud computing business drove a surprisingly strong quarter despite pressure from the slowing U.S. economy, the company said on Tuesday.
Revenue in the first three months of the year was up 7 percent from a year earlier to $52.9 billion, and profit was up 9 percent to $18.3 billion. Both exceeded Wall Street expectations.
Microsoft’s cloud business — which includes Azure, its cloud computing product, and its Microsoft 365 platform — had $28.5 billion in revenue, up 22 percent from a year earlier.
Sales of Azure, a key result watched by investors, grew 27 percent, which was in line with investors’ expectations. Still, that was a drop from a 46 percent increase the year before. Overall, the segment that the company calls Intelligent Cloud was up 16 percent from a year earlier, which was better than had been expected.
Microsoft’s cloud products are “certainly a very important engine for us going forward,” said James Ambrose, Microsoft’s director of investor relations.
Shares of Microsoft stock jumped more than 8 percent in after-hours trading.
Microsoft, like many other technology companies, has been hindered by the sluggish economy after substantial growth during the pandemic. The company said in January that it would lay off 10,000 employees.
The company’s Windows business has slumped as the global market for personal computer sales has slowed. Revenue from Microsoft’s personal computing segment in its most recent quarter was $13.3 billion, a 9 percent decrease from a year earlier. Within that category, revenue from Windows OEM — original installations of Windows software on new computers — sank 28 percent, and devices revenue was down 30 percent.
Revenue from Microsoft’s video game segment, its most important consumer business, was down 4 percent from a year earlier, as Xbox hardware sales fell 30 percent.
Still, Microsoft’s stock has remained strong, buoyed in part by the company’s foray into the booming field of artificial intelligence.
Mr. Ambrose cautioned that the strong numbers did not necessarily suggest an improving macroeconomic environment. “I don’t know that it signals a major change in our view” of the economy, he said.
Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said on a call with investors that sales growth in the current quarter could be flat compared with unusually strong quarter a year ago.
Microsoft is also poised to benefit from the boom in A.I. through its investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind the ChatGPT chatbot. It has already integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and the company has said it will incorporate A.I. into other Microsoft products as well.
Though the company said it was too early for the futuristic technology to affect its quarterly financial figures, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, said “A.I.” or “OpenAI” at least 24 times in his 15-minute introduction on the call with investors.
“We have the most powerful A.I. infrastructure,” Mr. Nadella said at one point, mentioning a variety of companies already using Microsoft’s A.I. tools in their businesses. To support high demand for its A.I. products, the company said, it will spend to scale up that infrastructure."

South Korea’s nuclear deal
The U.S. has agreed to give South Korea a central role in the strategic planning for the use of nuclear weapons in any conflict with North Korea. In return, South Korea agreed to not pursue its own nuclear arsenal.
The deal, announced during President Yoon Suk Yeol’s state visit to Washington, is meant to assure South Korea that the U.S. will use its nuclear arsenal, if needed, to dissuade or respond to a nuclear attack from the North — even if that risks a strike on an American city. The concept is called “extended deterrence.”
The accord is an admission that disarming North Korea is no longer plausible. In the past four years, the North’s arsenal has grown so fast that U.S. and South Korean officials have stopped trying to keep a precise count.

Xi speaks with Zelensky
Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, had long requested a conversation with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Yesterday, the two spoke by phone — their first known contact since Russia’s invasion.
Both framed the call carefully. China’s official account notably omitted the words “Russia” and “war,” and referred instead to the need for a “political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.” Zelensky said the discussion was “long and meaningful.”
Despite Xi’s conversation with Zelensky, China and Russia remain closely aligned: Last month, Xi met with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and the two also spoke little of the war, though China has floated a potential peace plan.
Xi has also been trying to burnish his image as a global statesman by helping to restore ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and by welcoming President Emmanuel Macron of France to China.

This spring, a new professional cricket league for women in India held its inaugural season — a $500 million bet on female talent in the country’s most popular sport.
The Women’s Premier League is already creating new opportunities for female athletes, as seen in one village in Punjab, where a team of girls ranging in age from 9 to 14 dream of becoming professional cricketers.
Their coach takes them to see games far away. He pours his salary into their team and brings recruiters to watch them play. He builds their confidence, encouraging them to see cricket as an escape from the confines of Indian village life, where women perform most of the domestic labor.

Microsoft faces a tough appeal process.

Lucy Nicholson/Reuters
The risks of doing deals
A British regulator’s decision to reject Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover bid for Activision Blizzard stunned many who had expected the deal to go through. That’s especially because moves this month by the agency, the Competition and Markets Authority, suggested that the transaction might pass muster.
But the decision only reinforces the current reality: More assertive regulators around the world present an additional challenge for corporate buyers at a time when deal makers are hoping to revive a moribund market for mergers and acquisitions.
The agency continues to flex its growing regulatory muscle. Though it narrowed the scope of its Activision deal inquiry to just one issue, cloud gaming, the C.M.A. said that letting Microsoft buy the Call of Duty maker could give the tech giant too much power over the video games market.
Most likely emboldening the agency is how unlikely an appeal of its decision is to succeed, according to Pablo Ibáñez Colomo, a law professor at the London School of Economics. The tribunal that will weigh Microsoft’s appeal will examine mainly whether the regulator followed proper procedure. That institutional advantage positions the agency as one of the world’s most influential antitrust enforcers, alongside those in the United States and the European Union.
Global regulators are reviewing deals more closely now. In the United States, it’s because of an ideological shift to oppose big companies from getting unduly bigger. And political reasons sometimes factor in: Consider that Berlin is scrutinizing Carrier’s about $13.3 billion takeover of Viessmann, a German maker of heat pumps, to ensure that the country remains competitive in renewable energy technologies.
Big deals are still on the table. The Swiss commodities giant Glencore, for instance, is still interested in buying Teck Resources, for at least $22.5 billion after having defeated a defensive move by  the Canadian mining company.

2023-04-28,"Since the pandemic began, Lyft employees have been able to work remotely, logging into videoconferences from their homes and dispersing across the country like many other tech workers. Last year, the company made that policy official, telling staff that work would be “fully flexible” and subleasing floors of its offices in San Francisco and elsewhere.
No longer. On Friday, David Risher, the company’s new chief executive, told employees in an all-hands meeting that they would be required to come back into the office at least three days a week, starting this fall. It was one of the first major changes he has made at the struggling ride-hailing company since starting this month, and it came just a day after he laid off 26 percent of Lyft’s work force.
“Things just move faster when you’re face to face,” Mr. Risher said in an interview. Remote work in the tech industry, he said, had come at a cost, leading to isolation and eroding culture. “There’s a real feeling of satisfaction that comes from working together at a whiteboard on a problem.”
The decision, combined with the layoffs and other changes, signals the beginning of a new chapter at Lyft. It could also be an indication that some tech companies — particularly firms that are struggling — may be changing their minds on flexibility about where employees work. Nudges toward working in the office could soon turn into demands, as they have at companies like Disney and Apple.

Bob Sutton, an organizational psychologist and a professor at Stanford, said that although in-person collaboration could help with creativity and some other parts of work, companies pushing for a return to office might be doing so to have greater oversight of their workers.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
“When top executives feel financial stress, the classic ‘threat-rigidity’ effect kicks in, and beyond possible benefits for communication, collaboration and creativity, they feel compelled to increase their own illusion of control,” Mr. Sutton said.
After lagging behind its rival, Uber, in the race to emerge from the pandemic doldrums, Lyft posted worrisome financial results in February. Its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, said the next month that they would step down.
Mr. Risher, a veteran of Microsoft and Amazon who also served on Lyft’s board of directors, has laid out a plan to streamline the business, cut costs and focus on improving the quality and lowering the price of Lyft’s core product: rides for customers.
Lyft employees have complained that divisions outside the ride-hailing business, like units that offer rental cars to its gig drivers and rent bikes and scooters to consumers, seemed to be disproportionately affected by the layoffs. Mr. Risher said the cuts were across the board.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
He said the cost savings from the layoffs would go toward lower prices for riders and higher earnings for drivers.
The next phase of his plan, he said, is to remind riders that Lyft is a viable alternative to Uber. In the summer, Mr. Risher said, he will gradually introduce products to increase interest in the platform. That may include teaming up with companies to offer Lyft rides to their employees who are commuting to offices, he said.
The next steps for the company will be difficult. Many Lyft employees have gotten used to working from home, and some were already bristling at the possibility of returning to the office. Lyft continues to trail Uber, which has a global ride-hailing business and also offers food delivery.
Lyft’s stock price is trading at $10 a share, down from $78 at its peak, and some have speculated that it could be an acquisition target. The company will report financial results for its most recent quarter next week and expects $975 million in revenue, lower than the $1.1 billion investors had hoped for earlier this year. It is not yet profitable.
Mr. Risher announced a handful of other changes on Thursday. He ended products focused on car rentals, as well as shared rides and luxury rides, and he promoted Kristin Sverchek, the head of business affairs, to president.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Lyft also planned to tell employees that it would reduce their stock grants this year, according to a person familiar with the decision.
The return to office plan, Mr. Risher said, would require workers to come in Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, with Tuesdays recommended, beginning after Labor Day. People will be allowed to work remotely for one month each year, and those living far from offices would not be required to come in.
Mr. Risher said he saw the moment as an opportunity to have a “cultural reset, particularly around decision-making.”
He said that Lyft was successful with its early ride-hailing business, but that Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer’s idea to build a transportation network, with products focused on scooters, bikes, parking and rental cars, “didn’t really resonate with people.” The company has pared back those offerings but does still have bikes and scooters.
“So now, my focus is saying, ‘Gosh, in ride share alone, there’s an enormous amount of innovation left.’ People desperately want to get out and live their lives, and we can help them,” Mr. Risher said. “And then maybe, over time, we can build some things back on top of that.”"

JPMorgan Chase went from advising First Republic to buying it.

Jim Wilson/The New York Times
Goodbye, First Republic; hello again, JPMorgan
First Republic is no more: Regulators seized the embattled lender overnight and sold it to JPMorgan Chase. What is now America’s second-biggest bank failure, after the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual, means that 84 bank branches that closed as First Republic locations on Friday will reopen on Monday as Chase branches.
The deal caps a flurry of negotiations in recent days to resolve the fate of First Republic, which failed to recover from the turmoil set off by Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse in March. Regulators and banking executives hope that the sale will bring an end to the regional banking crisis.
JPMorgan prevailed in an auction that ran over the weekend, beating out other contenders including PNC Financial Services. As part of the deal, JPMorgan will assume the majority of First Republic’s assets, including $173 billion in loans and $30 billion in securities, as well as $92 billion in deposits.
That will spare the F.D.I.C. from a bigger rescue bill: It doesn’t need to worry about having to cover First Republic’s roughly $50 billion in uninsured deposits, since they will move over to JPMorgan. (The F.D.I.C. still estimates its insurance fund will take a $13 billion hit, and the agency reached a loss-sharing agreement with JPMorgan on some loans.)

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The auction is another twist in the First Republic story. JPMorgan initially was an adviser to the troubled lender, with its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, helping convince his counterparts at other big banks to deposit $30 billion at First Republic in March as a lifeline.
But the plan failed to stabilize the lender, which announced last week that it had lost $100 billion in deposits during the first quarter. The news battered First Republic’s shares, with its market value falling to just $650 million on Friday, down from $20 billion before March, setting the stage for its sale."

Uber said on Tuesday that its revenue grew 29 percent in its most recent quarter as the company benefited from a series of investments in new services, as well as the continued return of drivers to its ride-hailing business.
The company said it had $8.8 billion in revenue, roughly in line with investors’ expectations. Uber had $31.4 billion in gross bookings — the amount of money paid by customers — a 19 percent jump from a year ago.
Uber said it remained on track to generate a quarterly profit from the strength of its business operations sometime this year — a milestone on the road to overall profitability.
“With our global scale and deeper local density, we are increasingly separating from smaller regional competitors both on driver preference and on the breadth of mobility products we offer consumers,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, said in a statement.
Shares of Uber stock ended the day nearly 12 percent higher after the company reported other figures that beat investor expectations.

Why It Matters: Uber offers more evidence of tech industry resilience.
Uber’s strong financial results come after encouraging performances from tech companies like Microsoft, Google’s parent company and Meta.
Uber has continued to recover from a slide during the pandemic, when it laid off thousands of employees. The company has since avoided the mass layoffs that have taken place at other tech companies, though it said on Tuesday that its overall head count was down after cuts at Drizly, an alcohol delivery platform owned by Uber, and in its freight business.
Uber said its U.S. and Canadian ride-hailing businesses, which had been slow to recover from the pandemic, were now growing faster, with trips in those regions up 40 percent from a year ago. The company said lower fares had helped with that growth. Uber invested heavily in financial incentives to get drivers back on its platform. Now drivers’ earnings are also increasing, the company said.
Background: Uber focused on incentives for drivers.
Uber’s main competitor, Lyft, did not invest as heavily on getting drivers back to its platform after pandemic lockdowns. With fewer drivers on the road, its prices have gone up.
Uber also has more products than Lyft, including partnerships with taxis and a shared-ride business. Bookings from products beyond its flagship UberX ride business grew more than 100 percent from a year earlier, the company said.
The company said it was confident about its rivalry with Lyft.
“They’re looking to price competitively with us, and we think that sets up a competitive environment where we’re competing on brand,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said on a call with investors.
Uber’s delivery business grew far more slowly than ride hailing but still managed 8 percent growth in bookings from a year ago. Its freight business shrank 23 percent, which the company attributed to the challenging economy.
Overall, Uber lost $157 million, cushioned by gains in its investments in other companies.
What’s Next: Lyft reports its quarterly results.
Lyft, which has undergone layoffs and leadership changes, will report its own financial results on Thursday. The company just cut 26 percent of employees and named a new chief executive."
2023-05-03,"The Federal Trade Commission escalated its fight with the tech industry’s biggest companies on Wednesday as it moved to impose what it called a “blanket prohibition” on the collection of young people’s personal data by Meta, Facebook’s parent company.
The commission wants to significantly expand a record $5 billion consent order with the company from 2020 and said that Meta had failed to fully meet the legal commitments it made to overhaul its privacy practices to better protect its users.
Regulators also said Meta had misled parents about their ability to control whom their children communicated with on its Messenger Kids app and misrepresented the access it gave some app developers to users’ private data.
The proposed changes mark the third time the agency has taken action against the social media giant over privacy issues.

“The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk,” Samuel Levine, the director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a press statement. “Facebook needs to answer for its failures.”
The F.T.C.’s administrative action, an internal agency procedure called an “order to show cause,” serves as a preliminary warning to Meta that regulators believe the company violated the 2020 privacy agreement. The document lays out the commission’s accusations against Meta as well its proposed restrictions."
2023-05-04,"The White House on Thursday pushed Silicon Valley chief executives to limit the risks of artificial intelligence, in the administration’s most visible effort to confront rising questions and calls to regulate the rapidly advancing technology.
For roughly two hours in the White House’s Roosevelt Room, Vice President Kamala Harris and other officials told the leaders of Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, and Anthropic, an A.I. start-up, to seriously consider concerns about the technology. President Biden also briefly stopped by the meeting.
“What you’re doing has enormous potential and enormous danger,” Mr. Biden told the executives.
It was the first White House gathering of major A.I. chief executives since the release of tools like ChatGPT, which have captivated the public and supercharged a race to dominate the technology.
“The private sector has an ethical, moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their products,” Ms. Harris said in a statement. “And every company must comply with existing laws to protect the American people.”
The meeting signified how the A.I. boom has entangled the highest levels of the American government and put pressure on world leaders to get a handle on the technology. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public last year, many of the world’s biggest tech companies have rushed to incorporate chatbots into their products and accelerated A.I. research. Venture capitalists have poured billions of dollars into A.I. start-ups.
But the A.I. explosion has also raised fears about how the technology might transform economies, shake up geopolitics and bolster criminal activity. Critics have worried that powerful A.I. systems are too opaque, with the potential to discriminate, displace people from jobs, spread disinformation and perhaps even break the law on their own."

Economists see job growth slowing.
Credit...
Jeff Chiu/Associated Press
A pivotal jobs report  
The U.S. labor market appears to be slowing. But is the economy still strong enough to avoid recession, as the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, contends? That’s the big question hanging over today’s payroll numbers, which are due for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.
Employers added roughly 180,000 jobs last month, economists have forecast. If correct, those figures would come in well below the 345,000-per-month average over the first quarter.
Forecasters have repeatedly underestimated the strength of the post-pandemic labor market. They have undershot the payroll number 12 straight times, assuming companies would pull back on hiring as the Fed raised borrowing rates to tame inflation. Instead, employers have added roughly 4.5 million jobs since the central bank started increasing interest rates in March 2022. That comes despite waves of layoffs in the tech and retailing sectors, and a banking crisis that has led to the collapse of three regional lenders since March.
Another hot jobs number could still influence the Fed’s interest rate policy. The Fed signaled that Wednesday’s rate increase would be its last for a while, but the central bank is determined to lower inflation to its 2 percent target. It has resolved to bring prices under control, “even at the expense of broader macro conditions, specifically calling out the still tight labor market,” Joe Davis, chief global economist at Vanguard, wrote in a note ahead of today’s report.

Keep an eye on wages. The Labor Department’s employment cost index recently showed wages growing above expectations last quarter, a factor that could be driving up inflation. So far, Davis said, the Fed has been unable to “manufacture a wage slowdown.”

Short sellers in focus as regional banks teeter
Shares in a group of closely watched regional lenders are rebounding this morning in premarket trading, led by PacWest and Western Alliance, after getting clobbered on Thursday. But analysts warn the upheaval is far from over, especially as short sellers continue to circle.
Shares in PacWest and Western Alliance plunged even as the lenders opened up their books to show that their deposit bases were relatively sound. Their finances are not the worry, analysts say. It’s that a crisis of confidence has swept through the sector since the fall of Silicon Valley Bank in March, compounding the risk that falling share prices will set off another round of bank runs.
From Wall Street to Washington, short sellers are under scrutiny. These investors, who profit from the falling share price of companies they target, have made roughly $7 billion in 2023 betting against regional banks, according to data from S3 Partners. “The other scary thing is that the attacks are increasingly looking speculative, but risk becoming self fulfilling,” wrote Jim Reid, head of global fundamental credit strategy at Deutsche Bank, in an investor note on Friday.

Wall Street wants more. Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, a prominent law firm that has represented businesses facing short-seller attacks such as the Adani Group, urged the S.E.C. to reinstate a 2008 emergency rule that placed a 15-day short-selling ban on banks. The firm also suggested bringing back the uptick rule, a trading restriction designed to limit volatile share price drops. “The country needs a prompt, tailored response by the S.E.C. to coordinated short attacks that are putting our economy at great risk,” the firm wrote in a statement. And, in a letter to the S.E.C. chairman, Gary Gensler, the American Bankers Association urged the regulator “to consider all its existing tools” to protect banks from short sellers.
Mr. Gensler has vowed to keep a close eye on any market misconduct. But an agency spokesman said the S.E.C. was not contemplating measures that would place limits on short selling.
The F.D.I.C. reportedly wants big banks to pay up. The agency will introduce in the coming days a new set of fees meant to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund that was depleted by the bank runs at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, according to Bloomberg. Banks with under $10 billion in assets would be exempt from paying.
Nelson Peltz, the activist investor and C.E.O. of Trian Fund Management, has another idea for how to top up the fund: Customers with more than $250,000 in deposits should pay an insurance premium, he told The Financial Times.

It was not all good news: Revenues declined for the second consecutive quarter, just the third time in a decade that the company has posted back-to-back falls. But shares are up more than 2 percent in premarket trading, after the company announced a $90 billion share buyback program and increased its dividend by 4 percent.
New markets and services powered growth. Sales in the U.S. and China fell, but Apple’s finance chief, Luca Maestri, said that growth in India, Indonesia, Latin America and the Middle East helped the company “offset some macroeconomic challenges.”
India is a particular focus. Apple has expanded manufacturing and last month opened its first retail store in the country of 1.4 billion. Executives mentioned India 20 times on a conference call with analysts, and Tim Cook, Apple’s C.E.O., called it a priority. “There are a lot of people coming into the middle class and I really feel that India is at a tipping point,” he said.
Mr. Cook had little to say about artificial intelligence. The tech earnings season has been dominated by questions about how A.I. fits into companies’ growth plans. Compared with Microsoft and Google, Apple has revealed far less about its vision for the tech. Mr. Cook acknowledged the huge potential but warned that it was necessary to be “deliberate and thoughtful” in how A.I. was implemented. “And there’s a number of issues that need to be sorted,” he added.
What next? The company is reportedly trying to diversify its supply chain away from China and is expected to unveil its long-awaited augmented reality device at its developers’ conference next month.

2023-05-07,"Five hours is enough time to watch a Mets game. It is enough time to listen to the Spice Girls’ “Spice” album (40 minutes), Paul Simon’s “Paul Simon” album (42 minutes) and Gustav Mahler’s third symphony (his longest). It is enough time to roast a chicken, text your friends that you’ve roasted a chicken and prepare for an impromptu dinner party.
Or you could spend it checking your email. Five hours is about how long many workers spend on email each day. And 90 minutes on the messaging platform Slack.
It’s a weird thing, workplace chatter like email and Slack: It’s sometimes the most delightful and human part of the work day. It can also be mind-numbing to manage your inbox — to the extent you might wonder, couldn’t a robot do this?
In late April, I decided to see what it would be like to let artificial intelligence into my life. I resolved to do an experiment. For one week, I would write all my work communication — emails, Slack messages, pitches, follow-ups with sources — through ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence language model from the research lab OpenAI. I didn’t tell colleagues until the end of the week (except in a few instances of personal weakness). I downloaded a Chrome extension that drafted email responses directly into my inbox. But most of the time, I ended up writing detailed prompts into ChatGPT, asking it to be either witty or formal depending on the situation.

What resulted was a roller coaster, emotionally and in terms of the amount of content I was generating. I started the week inundating my teammates (sorry) to see how they would react. At a certain point, I lost patience with the bot and developed a newfound appreciation for phone calls.
My bot, unsurprisingly, couldn’t match the emotional tone of any online conversation. And I spend a lot of the week, because of hybrid work, having online conversations."
2023-05-08,"By midyear, all of Morgan Stanley’s thousands of wealth advisers are expected to have access to a new artificial-intelligence-powered chat tool.
The tool, which is already in use by about 600 staff members, gives advisers answers to questions such as “Can you compare the investment cases for Apple, IBM and Microsoft?” and follow-ups such as “What are the risks of each of them?” An adviser can ask what to do if a client has a potentially valuable painting — and the knowledge tool might provide a list of steps to follow, along with the name of an internal expert who can help.
“What we’re trying to do is make every client or every financial adviser as smart as the most knowledgeable expert on any given topic in real time,” said Jeff McMillan, the head of analytics, data and innovation for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.
Experts disagree about whether A.I. will wind up destroying more jobs than it creates over time. But it is clear that A.I. will alter work for most knowledge workers, shifting the skills they need and changing the staffing needs of most companies. Now it’s up to business leaders to figure out how to take advantage of the technologies today, while preparing workers for the disruption that the tools present over the medium term.

Moving too slowly may mean losing out on gains in productivity, customer service and — ultimately — competitiveness, similar to what happened to businesses that didn’t embrace the internet fully or fast enough. But at the same time, leaders must guard against the mistakes and biases A.I. often perpetuates and be thoughtful about what it means for employees.
“Almost no matter which sector you are in, you need to be thinking about your company as becoming an A.I.-first company,” said Alexandra Mousavizadeh, chief executive at Evident, a start-up that analyzes finance companies’ A.I. capabilities.
The type of A.I. underlying Morgan Stanley’s tool for advisers is called generative A.I. It can create content — including text, images, audio and video — from information it has analyzed. In addition to answering questions, it can be used in countless other ways, such as drafting memos and emails, creating presentation slides and summarizing long documents. Early research suggests that tools built using generative A.I. could speed up many tasks and increase employee productivity.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford researchers, for example, found that customer support staffs equipped with an A.I. tool that suggested responses resolved 14 percent more customer issues each hour on average.
But the gains were not evenly spread. Less-experienced workers made greater productivity jumps, because the tools effectively “captured and disseminated” the practices of their higher-skilled colleagues. Other recent M.I.T. research similarly noted that workers who weren’t initially as good at tasks managed to narrow the gap with those who were more skilled, performing better and taking less time when aided by A.I.

One possible conclusion from these findings is “that the advantage that someone had from tenure in terms of their performance has now diminished because a youngster with ChatGPT can perform as well as somebody who’s had a few years’ experience,” said Azeem Azhar, chairman of Exponential View, a research group. If the research plays out in broader practice, that could potentially lead some companies to invest more in junior staff members, while going lighter on more expensive workers who have been around longer.
Some companies are already starting to make staffing decisions based on the anticipated impact of A.I. tools. IBM recently said it was slowing or stopping hiring for some back-office roles, such as human-resources functions, that could be replaced by A.I. over the next several years.
The speed and productivity gains from A.I. will raise customer expectations, said Bivek Sharma, the chief technology officer for PwC Global Tax and Legal Services. “It’s then about making sure we can re-skill the work force quickly enough and A.I.-enable them quickly enough to meet the obvious demand that’s going to come on the back of it,” he said.
PwC is working with Harvey, an A.I. start-up creating tools for lawyers, to roll out a chat A.I. tool to its entire legal advisory practice over the next few months. It plans to extend such technology to its tax and human resources experts as well.
Beyond quickly providing staff members with answers that draw on the firm’s expertise, PwC’s goal is to generate new insights, including eventually by analyzing its clients’ data as well, Mr. Sharma said. The A.I. could potentially be fed all of the contracts of two companies contemplating a merger, for example, and allow PwC experts to query for specific types of provisions and risks.

“Think of this as really an augmentation play rather than a timesaving play for us,” Mr. Sharma said. “This is almost like a senior associate that is attached to every one of our legal and tax advisers augmenting what they can do day to day for their clients.”
Larger companies generally need to invest in A.I.-savvy technical staff members, who can adapt the technology for their business. Already, “there are companies that can’t adopt ChatGPT because they simply don’t have the sort of basic rails upon which to run it on, which is content management and the data in order,” Ms. Mousavizadeh said.
They also need to hire or train new specialists, for roles that don’t necessarily require technical expertise. Morgan Stanley’s Mr. McMillan and other corporate executives say the A.I. platforms require continuous “tuning,” with humans adjusting parameters and information sources to get the best results for users. This tuning has created a need for a new group of workers known as “prompt engineers” or “knowledge engineers.”
Morgan Stanley and PwC are among those building their own versions of A.I. chat tools that draw from internal materials.
Concerns about security, confidentiality, accuracy and intellectual property rights have led many companies to restrict their staffs’ access to public ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools. They want to avoid what reportedly happened at Samsung, where employees working in its semiconductor division are said to have shared confidential computer code and meeting notes while using ChatGPT. Executives are also concerned about the frequent errors and built-in biases with some A.I. tools.

But part of the opportunity with tools that use generative A.I., which allow users to type questions or commands in normal language, is to include a broader group of nontechnical staff members in figuring out how it can change a company’s business. “Your people should be using these tools really, really regularly so they can start to build up their competencies and your own internal firm competencies,” Mr. Azhar said.
He suggests that A.I. public tools can be used in ways that don’t endanger confidentiality or security. For example, an employee could ask ChatGPT about the best ways to combine types of sales data to tell a compelling story without actually entering the data itself. The opportunity, he says, comes from “front-line employees of whatever seniority deciding to improve their work through generative tools.”

2023-05-10,"When the San Francisco start-up OpenAI released ChatGPT late last year, the A.I. chatbot looked like the first significant threat in decades to Google. One day, tech insiders thought, it could make Google’s internet search engine look old and stodgy.
Google executives vowed a fast response to protect the company’s $162 billion franchise and said that artificial intelligence would be woven throughout its products, from the search engine to email.
On Wednesday, at its annual conference in Mountain View, Calif., the company demonstrated some of what it has been working on. Google said its search engine will begin incorporating responses generated by A.I. at the top of query results pages and allow users to ask follow-up questions.
It was a notable step toward Google’s embrace of A.I., which many experts believe could remake the tech industry. Google was a pioneer in the technology, but had been reluctant to do too much with it because A.I. comes with risks, like spreading false information.

But Google, along with the rest of Silicon Valley, was surprised by the success of ChatGPT. In December, Google declared a “code red” to find ways to incorporate the technology behind ChatGPT, called generative A.I., into its own products.
Google said at its conference on Wednesday that it has now embedded its latest A.I. technology into 25 products, including the search updates and a feature to help users write emails in Gmail.
“Seven years into our journey as an A.I.-first company, we are at an exciting inflection point,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said at the conference. “With generative A.I., we’re taking the next step, with a bold and responsible approach, we are reimagining all of our products.”
The company also doubled down on its hardware ambitions, releasing two new smartphones and a tablet. On the high end was the Pixel Fold, Google’s first folding phone. For the budget minded, it offered the Pixel 7A, a phone that costs $500. The company made its Pixel Tablet both portable and able to dock on a speaker, so it can function like a smart home display.

Google has been racing against OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft. In February, Microsoft demonstrated how the newest version of Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, incorporates a chatbot that works with the technology developed by OpenAI.
But Google is still taking a more measured approach than its main competitors. The company did not include a chatbot, which can be prone to making up false information, in its search engine. Instead, Google said it will use A.I. to provide some answers, which will be corroborated by authoritative websites, and it will continue including ads in responses.
Liz Reid, a Google search vice president, said in an interview ahead of the conference that users expected the company to have high-quality information and it did not want to undermine that trust.
“The technology is early,” Ms. Reid said. “It’s amazing in some ways and it has a bunch of challenges in other ways.”

In March, Google released Bard, an experimental chatbot meant to compete with ChatGPT. Google on Wednesday broadened access the tool, bringing it to more than 180 countries and territories in English, and also offering it in Japanese and Korean.
Mr. Pichai also discussed the company’s efforts to build more powerful A.I. technology. He unveiled the latest version of that more powerful technology, Pathways Language Model 2, or PaLM 2, and said work had begun on an even larger model named Gemini.

A.I. models are the huge systems that are used to develop artificial intelligence, and so far only a handful of companies have the resources to develop them.

Google said it made Bard, which can generate emails, shopping lists and poems, more intelligent and creative by running it on PaLM 2. The chatbot will be able to show and interpret images and allow users to export responses to Gmail, Docs and other applications.
The company has started integrating generative A.I. into its Workspace applications, including Gmail, Docs and Sheets. Users will be able to use brief text descriptions to create images for a slide deck or draft documents, with options to change the writing style to be more professional or casual.
Since ChatGPT was introduced, Google has faced criticism from tech industry insiders that it had not moved fast enough to improve its search. But Ms. Reid said the company’s large number of users was “the chorus we should listen to the loudest.”
“There is still huge opportunity in the world in meeting people’s information needs and there will always be lots of people trying to solve it, and I think that’s great,” she said. “It will help us — help everyone — evolve.”

Investors have been closely watching Google’s A.I. progress, and they have been concerned about the competitive threat from OpenAI and Microsoft. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in an interview that this year’s presentation did not “end the concerns, but it partially addresses them.”
“They needed to remind people that they’ve been doing a lot of innovation in A.I. for a long time,” he said, “and they got that point across.”"

The FTX bankruptcy proceeding has been full of surprises.

Amanda Perobelli/Reuters
Too quick to sell?
Working through the bankruptcy of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried’s collapsed crypto exchange, is proving more complicated all the time. The latest evidence: a potentially lucrative missed opportunity that’s come to light after FTX offloaded warrants to buy an obscure crypto token.
The token is called Sui, and it made its trading debut on May 3. FTX — which is now being run by John Ray III, the restructuring expert who has recouped billions for creditors victimized by the mega-bankruptcies of Enron, Fruit of the Loom and Nortel Networks — sold its Sui warrants shortly before the token began trading.
Had FTX exercised the warrants, it would own, as of this morning, an asset worth more than $1 billion, even after a 75 percent drop since the start of trading last week.
Here’s what happened with Sui:
FTX invested about $101 million in Mysten Labs last year. Mysten was building a blockchain platform called Sui that relied on technology developed for Diem, Facebook’s aborted crypto project. Mysten attracted investors like Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, pushing its valuation at one point to about $2 billion.
FTX led the fund-raising last summer. Its ownership interest included warrants for 890 million Sui crypto tokens that would be exercisable once the Sui platform launched. But FTX collapsed months later.
In March, FTX sought the bankruptcy court’s permission to sell its interest in Mysten for about $96 million, or $5 million less than the initial investment.
In April, that deal closed. On May 3, Sui tokens began trading, with prices quickly spiking. This morning, Sui was trading at $1.13.
FTX is in a race to recoup every penny as the creditor list swells. Mr. Bankman-Fried himself has said that if given enough time, he could find the assets of value in his vast empire to begin to pay back customers and investors.

The I.R.S. last month filed nearly $44 billion worth of “priority” tax claims against FTX’s estate and its sister trading firms, CoinDesk reports.
FTX has already found billions for creditors. “The situation has been stabilized and the dumpster fire is out,” the company’s lawyers told a bankruptcy judge last month, revealing that they had recovered more than $7 billion."

Game back on for Microsoft-Activision?
Credit...
Martin Meissner/Associated Press
Will Europe muddy the future of Microsoft’s big deal?
European antitrust regulators are set to weigh in Monday on Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard. In a twist, the European Commission is reportedly set to approve a video game megadeal that its American and British counterparts have already rejected.
If that happens, tech giants will be left with an even more confusing regulatory landscape to contend with, as three of the world’s most powerful antitrust regulators take different policy tacks.
The E.U. is expected to be satisfied with Microsoft’s concessions on the deal, namely pledges to make sure top titles like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft are available to rival video game platforms like Sony’s and Nintendo’s.
That would be a very different conclusion than that reached last month by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, which argued that Microsoft could end up dominating the nascent business of cloud gaming — and that no solution apart from selling off big chunks of Activision would be acceptable.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It would be a striking show of leniency by a notoriously tough regulator. The E.U. has been among the most aggressive in policing Big Tech, having fined companies like Google billions and forced changes in their business practices. But in recent years, American regulators like the F.T.C., under Lina Khan, have gone even further, pushing back against takeovers by tech giants, and openly questioning whether they should get even bigger.
Microsoft and others are left trying to navigate an increasingly complicated thicket of global rules, where regulators are coming to very different conclusions about the same issues. And given the size and importance of the British, European and U.S. markets, simply ignoring any one of them is impossible.
The deal’s future is clearer, and bleaker, if the E.U. rejects it. Microsoft and Activision are already appealing the decisions by the F.T.C. and the C.M.A.; overturning the British regulator’s decision is expected to be especially tough. (The body that will weigh the C.M.A. appeal could take months, and will review only whether the regulator’s decision followed proper procedures.)
Fighting a third battle — especially against a regulator that overwhelmingly tends to succeed in appeals — would only make an especially difficult fight that much harder.

The many losers of the Vice bankruptcy
Vice, the once-highflying digital media outlet, filed for bankruptcy overnight, as the punishing economics of online publishing took their toll.
The company has received at least one rescue bid to acquire it out of Chapter 11, potentially sparing it a drawn-out and disruptive trip through bankruptcy. But the $225 million offer price is a reminder of how far Vice has fallen, taking some of the top names in media and finance with it.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
It was just six years ago that Vice was valued at $5.7 billion, as the upstart drew in investors like TPG, Disney, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and the advertising giant WPP.
All those companies expected Vice — along with rivals like BuzzFeed and Vox — to reinvent the media business through a focus on youthful content and an ability to draw in reader eyeballs from social media platforms. At the time, Vice and its backers dreamed of going public or selling at an even higher valuation.

Now those investors are set to be wiped out. Vice, like its peers, failed to wring profits from its audience, losing most of that revenue to the social networks that funneled readers to them. BuzzFeed has shut its news division and is at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq, while Vox has slashed its valuation in half.
Vice could soon be taken over by major creditors, led by Fortress and Soros Fund Management, who first lent the publisher $250 million in 2019. The two have offered to essentially convert what Vice owes them into equity, to the tune of $225 million, as well as assume other “significant liabilities.” (They would also likely keep on Shane Smith, the publisher’s outspoken co-founder and most prominent personality.)
It’s unclear whether others will make offers, especially given the economic uncertainty around the online publishing business. For their part, Vice’s current leaders said the bankruptcy filing and subsequent sale would ultimately “strengthen the company.”

2023-05-16,"When computer scientists at Microsoft started to experiment with a new artificial intelligence system last year, they asked it to solve a puzzle that should have required an intuitive understanding of the physical world.
“Here we have a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail,” they asked. “Please tell me how to stack them onto each other in a stable manner.”
The researchers were startled by the ingenuity of the A.I. system’s answer. Put the eggs on the book, it said. Arrange the eggs in three rows with space between them. Make sure you don’t crack them.
“Place the laptop on top of the eggs, with the screen facing down and the keyboard facing up,” it wrote. “The laptop will fit snugly within the boundaries of the book and the eggs, and its flat and rigid surface will provide a stable platform for the next layer.”
The clever suggestion made the researchers wonder whether they were witnessing a new kind of intelligence. In March, they published a 155-page research paper arguing that the system was a step toward artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., which is shorthand for a machine that can do anything the human brain can do. The paper was published on an internet research repository.
Microsoft, the first major tech company to release a paper making such a bold claim, stirred one of the tech world’s testiest debates: Is the industry building something akin to human intelligence? Or are some of the industry’s brightest minds letting their imaginations get the best of them?

2023-05-18,"Since ChatGPT debuted in November, hundreds of millions of people have experimented with the online chatbot, which can answer questions, write poetry, draft emails and riff on almost any topic from inside a web browser.
On Thursday, OpenAI, the San Francisco artificial intelligence lab behind ChatGPT, unveiled a new version of the chatbot for the iPhone, hoping to build on its enormous popularity.
Unlike the browser-based version of ChatGPT, the smartphone app responds to voice commands, operating a bit like Apple’s Siri digital assistant or Amazon’s Alexa. The app does not answer with voice, but generates responses in text.
In a blog post, OpenAI said the app was part of its effort to transform its A.I. research into “useful tools that empower people, while continuously making them more accessible.” It declined to comment further.

In offering its flagship technology to billions of iPhone users, OpenAI is solidifying its position among the giants of the tech industry. ChatGPT is the most prominent example of what is called generative A.I., technology that can generate text, images and other media based on short prompts. Google, Microsoft and various start-ups have released similar bots and have begun to roll such technology into a wide range of online services.
The result of more than a decade of research at companies like Google and OpenAI, these chatbots are poised to remake everything from internet search engines like Google Search and Bing to email programs like Gmail and Outlook.
They can generate digital text that can be used in almost any context, including for students to write term papers and businesspeople to create email messages and other marketing materials.
The technology is not perfect. Because these chatbots learn by analyzing vast amounts of digital text culled from across the internet, they cannot distinguish between fact and fiction. And the computer code they generate is often flawed.
Today, the technology tends to complement human workers rather than replace their skills outright.
OpenAI is not the first to introduce technology that lets people use ChatGPT with voice; some small companies and independent developers have already done so. Microsoft also offers a version of its Bing chatbot that responds to voice commands.

The new iPhone app is free. Subscribers of ChatGPT Plus — available for $20 a month — can use a more powerful version of the chatbot based on a technology called GPT-4.
OpenAI began rolling out the app in the United States on Thursday and will expand into other countries in the coming weeks. A version of the app for Android phones is also in the works."

But while Mr. DeSantis privately told donors and supporters on a telephone call on Thursday that he, not Trump, had the best chance of beating President Biden, he suffered another blow in his fight with Disney — one that may cost Florida thousands of jobs and raise more questions about his policies and strategy.
DeSantis dismissed Trump’s chances for victory. During the call, he said that just “two have a chance to get elected president — Biden and me.” Mr. DeSantis also ticked off his list of legislative accomplishments.
He undoubtedly is on strong financial footing, with more than $80 million expected to be transferred from his state account to his Super PAC, which has already raised more than $30 million.
But Disney dealt Mr. DeSantis a significant defeat on Thursday, scrapping plans to build a $1 billion office complex in Orlando that was expected to bring more than 2,000 jobs with an average salary of $120,000. Florida officials had repeatedly cited the development as a promising economic opportunity for Orlando, with hotel chains and retailers arriving in anticipation of the project.
People familiar with the decision told The Times that Disney’s feud with Mr. DeSantis — which had escalated into a bitter fight over control of the entity that oversees Disney World — played a major factor. That said, the plan had been devised under Disney’s former chief, Bob Chapek, and his predecessor/successor, Bob Iger, had long been cool to the idea.

2023-05-22,"Meta on Monday was fined a record 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) and ordered to stop transferring data collected from Facebook users in Europe to the United States, in a major ruling against the social media company for violating European Union data protection rules.
The penalty, announced by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, is potentially one of the most consequential in the five years since the European Union enacted the landmark data privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Regulators said the company failed to comply with a 2020 decision by the European Union’s highest court that Facebook data shipped across the Atlantic was not sufficiently protected from American spy agencies.
But it remains unclear if or when Meta will ever need to cordon off the data of Facebook users in Europe. Meta said it would appeal the decision, setting up a potentially lengthy legal process.
At the same time, European Union and American officials are negotiating a new data-sharing pact that would provide legal protections for Meta and scores of other companies to continue moving information between the United States and Europe — a pact that could nullify much of the European Union’s ruling on Monday. A preliminary deal was announced last year.
The ruling, which comes with a grace period of at least five months before Meta needs to comply, applies only to Facebook and not to Instagram and WhatsApp, which Meta also owns. The company said there would be no immediate disruption to Facebook’s service in the Europe Union.
Still, the E.U. decision shows how government policies are upending the borderless way that data has traditionally moved. As a result of data-protection rules, national security laws and other regulations, companies are increasingly being pushed to store data within the country where it is collected, rather than allowing it to move freely to data centers around the world.

2023-05-24,"The discussion on Twitter Spaces between Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, will be moderated by David Sacks, a fitting bridge between them.
A Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor, Mr. Sacks is a close friend of Mr. Musk, having worked with him as an executive in the early days of PayPal, the digital payments company that was the source of Mr. Musk’s early wealth.
Mr. Sacks was among the investors who provided funding for Mr. Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter last year, and was a trusted confidant during the ownership transition, though he denied having an “official role.”
He is also a Republican donor who gave $50,000 to Mr. DeSantis’s state political committee ahead of his re-election, campaign finance records show. He has praised the governor on several occasions, including for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Florida.
“He was the first governor to stop these insane lockdowns,” Mr. Sacks said on Bloomberg TV in 2021. “I respect that.”
Mr. Sacks has experience in audio broadcasting as a co-host of the popular “All-In” podcast, which features an assemblage of Silicon Valley figures discussing technology, politics and miscellanea.
He founded Yammer, a communication tool that was sold to Microsoft in 2012 for $1.2 billion. His current firm, Craft Ventures, includes investments in Uber, Slack, Quora and Airbnb."
2023-05-25,"The prospect that the U.S. government will default on its payments because Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling is now real and imminent. In fact, bonds issued by some corporations are yielding less than Treasuries, indicating that investors now consider, say, Microsoft a more reliable debtor than the federal government.
As disaster looms, it’s important to keep in mind that Republicans are the villains here: They’re the ones engaged in extortion.
The reason I say this is that progressives are feeling a lot of rage against the Biden administration for refusing to take action to avoid this crisis. And at least some people in or close to the administration seem more dedicated to rejecting proposed ways out of the trap than they are to solving the problem. There’s a definite Stockholm syndrome vibe, in which the hostages seem angrier at their would-be rescuers than they are at their kidnappers.
So I hope that the administration will take what I say now as what it is — an attempt to be helpful.

There are at least three ways the administration could, in principle, bypass the debt ceiling. The objections to these options purport to be technocratic or legal, or both, but when you dig a bit you realize that they’re really political.
The first possible strategy is simply to ignore the debt limit, declaring it unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment, which says that the validity of U.S. debt “shall not be questioned,” has been getting a lot of attention. But more broadly, the debt ceiling impasse has put the administration in a position where it must break some laws — either the laws that specify federal spending or the law limiting government borrowing. In such a position, the president must choose which laws to obey; why should the debt ceiling take priority?"

Retaking land occupied by an enemy during war is a brutally difficult task. But a military trying to do so usually has one big advantage: surprise. The occupying force does not know when or where the attackers will strike.
In 1944, the U.S. and its allies tricked the Nazis into believing that an invasion of France would take place on a different part of the Atlantic coast than it did. Today, Ukraine is similarly hoping to surprise Russia with the start of a spring or summer counteroffensive. The Russians know that a major attack is coming but not the form it will take.
The outcome of that counteroffensive could shape the outcome of the war. A successful campaign by Ukraine, retaking territory that Russia now controls, could cause President Vladimir Putin to fear outright defeat and look for a face-saving peace deal. A failed counteroffensive could cause Ukraine’s Western allies to wonder whether the war is winnable and potentially push Ukraine toward an unfavorable truce.
In today’s newsletter, I’ll preview the coming phase of the war, with help from colleagues covering it. The counteroffensive could start at any point over the next several weeks.

The land bridge
The so-called land bridge that Russia has established in southeastern Ukraine is likely to be the focus:

The southern edge of the land bridge is the Crimean Peninsula, which Russian forces invaded and seized almost a decade ago. Since the larger war began last year, Putin has also taken control of territory that connects Crimea to Russia, including the port city of Mariupol and much of the Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine. “The Ukrainians want to break the land bridge,” Julian Barnes, who covers intelligence agencies in Washington, told me.
The territory that Russia controls gives it several strategic advantages. One, Ukraine is cut off from about half of its coastline. Two, the territory includes a nuclear plant near the city of Zaporizhzhia that is a major producer of electricity.
Three, and perhaps most significantly, Russia can more easily supply its troops in Crimea. The land bridge is one of two routes for Russia’s military supplies to Crimea and towns in southern Ukraine, according to Andrew Kramer, The Times’s Kyiv bureau chief. (The other is the Kerch Strait.)
Punching through
Experts have compared the war’s recent months to World War I, with both sides dug into trenches and neither making much progress. Russia lost tens of thousands of troops this year merely to capture Bakhmut, a marginal city in the Donbas.

Ukraine hopes that its counteroffensive will end this stalemate. Western allies have supplied the Ukrainian military with billions of dollars of equipment and trained its troops at camps in Germany over the past few months. The troops have learned a technique known as combined-arms warfare, in which different parts of the military work together to take territory. Tanks punch through enemy lines by rolling over trenches, for example, and infantry then spread out to hold the area.
“The counteroffensive will very likely start in multiple places, maybe in the south and the east,” Julian said. “Some of those will be feints. Some will be part of the main efforts.”
Ukraine still has fewer troops and less equipment than Russia, but Ukraine’s military has so far proven more effective — with better morale, smarter tactics and more advanced Western weapons — than Russia’s. The counteroffensive is effectively a bet that Ukraine can use those advantages not just to repel Russia but to retake large territories.
As Thomas Gibbons-Neff, a Ukraine correspondent, said, “If Ukraine manages to sever the land bridge, Russian troops will be under further strain and, more importantly, Ukraine will be in a better position to attack farther east and south, toward Crimea.”
Most experts do not believe Ukraine will retake Crimea anytime soon — or that this war will end with Crimea back under Ukrainian control. Still, Ukraine does not need that outcome for the counteroffensive to be a success. Any major progress could cause Putin and his aides to worry that a long war would bring further losses and eventually put Crimea at risk. “The Russian people do care about Crimea,” my colleague Helene Cooper said. Before the Soviet era, the region was part of Russia for decades.

In the favorable scenario for Ukraine, a peace deal in which Russia is expelled from everywhere but Crimea and parts of the Donbas region would become plausible. On the flip side, a failed counteroffensive and an unbroken land bridge would provide Putin with a big psychological victory and a foundation from which to launch future attacks.
An important factor is that Ukraine now has enough weapons for only one major push. If the Ukrainians have not made progress by the fall, when colder and wetter weather makes fighting harder, the Russian land bridge may begin to look impregnable.
As Helene points out, however, Ukraine has frequently exceeded expectations in this war. Even the fall of Bakhmut, while a disappointment, took months longer than analysts expected. In the months ahead, Ukraine’s military will try to accomplish perhaps its most difficult task since repelling Russia’s initial invasion.

2023-05-30,"When it comes to artificial intelligence chatbots, bigger is typically better.
Large language models like ChatGPT and Bard, which generate conversational, original text, improve as they are fed more data. Every day, bloggers take to the internet to explain how the latest advances — an app that summarizes‌ ‌articles, A.I.-generated podcasts, a fine-tuned model that can answer any question related to professional basketball — will “change everything.”
But making bigger and more capable A.I. requires processing power that few companies possess, and there is growing concern that a small group, including Google, Meta, OpenAI and Microsoft, will exercise near-total control over the technology.
Also, bigger language models are harder to understand. They are often described as “black boxes,” even by the people who design them, and leading figures in the field have expressed ‌unease ‌that ‌A.I.’s goals may ultimately not align with our own. If bigger is better, it is also more opaque and more exclusive.
In January, a group of young academics working in natural language processing — the branch of A.I. focused on linguistic understanding — issued a challenge to try to turn this paradigm on its head. The group called for teams to create functional language models ‌using data sets that are less than one-ten-thousandth the size of those used by the most advanced large language models. A successful mini-model would be nearly as capable as the high-end models but much smaller, more accessible and ‌more compatible with humans. The project is called the BabyLM Challenge.
“We’re challenging people to think small and focus more on building efficient systems that way more people can use,” said Aaron Mueller, a computer scientist at Johns Hopkins University and an organizer of BabyLM.
Alex Warstadt, a computer scientist at ETH Zurich and another organizer of the project, added, “The challenge puts questions about human language learning, rather than ‘How big can we make our models?’ at the center of the conversation.”

2023-05-31,"FANCY BEAR GOES PHISHING: The Dark History of the Information Age, in Five Extraordinary Hacks, by Scott J. Shapiro
Don’t let the adorable title fool you: As Scott J. Shapiro acknowledges in “Fancy Bear Goes Phishing,” his new book about cybersecurity, hacking can inflict terrible harm. Shapiro is the author, with Oona A. Hathaway, of “The Internationalists” (2017), which recounts 20th-century efforts to outlaw war; among the numerous questions animating “Fancy Bear Goes Phishing” is whether hacking has opened the door to war by other means.
After all, “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear” refer to the cyberespionage units linked to Russian intelligence that gained access to the Democratic National Committee’s computer systems before the 2016 presidential election. Fancy Bear released a trove of emails that included Hillary Clinton’s closed-door speeches to Goldman Sachs and her campaign chairman’s tips for risotto.
The hack was undeniably embarrassing, and the 2016 election results ended up being so close that it’s impossible to say whether the drip-drip-drip of leaked emails was a factor in turning a roiling tide in Donald J. Trump’s favor. Not to mention that hacking into the D.N.C.’s systems “was a standard act of espionage,” Shapiro writes, and espionage happens to be legal under international law. Spies like to go phishing — so what? It’s what they do with their catch that’s the real question. In “releasing the pilfered information” for the world to see, “Fancy Bear might have engaged in an act of war.”
“Might have” — now there’s a tiny phrase with a lot of wiggle room, and Shapiro is in no hurry to pin it down. One of his themes is how hackers “exploit the duality principle,” or “the ambiguity between code and data,” both of which can be represented by numbers. I would argue that Shapiro, a professor of law and philosophy at Yale Law School, does something analogous with this book — though unlike most of the hackers he describes, he uses ambiguity to largely benevolent effect. Books are composed of words, and anyone looking for words that amount to a comprehensive guide to cybersecurity or an apocalyptic thriller about a digital Armageddon would be more efficiently served elsewhere. Shapiro might have some things to say about cybercrime and cyberwar, but what he really wants to do with his words is tell us the stories of five hacks.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The business with the D.N.C. is one. The others involve the Morris Worm, which infected the early internet in 1988 and happened to be created by the son of the chief scientist for computer security at the National Security Agency; the 1990s malware handiwork of a Bulgarian hacker known as the Dark Avenger; the 2005 hack into Paris Hilton’s cellphone by a 16-year-old boy; and the “Mirai botnet,” a networked supercomputer developed in 2016 by three teenagers that gathered strength by secretly conscripting so-called smart appliances, like security cameras and toasters.
Image
Shapiro himself started out as a computer science major in college and had a stint as a tech entrepreneur, constructing databases for clients that included Time-Life Books. He didn’t hack his first computer until he was 52, though he made up for lost time by hacking the Yale Law School website, “a feat that my dean did not appreciate.” Shapiro is funny and unflaggingly fascinated by his subject, luring even the nonspecialist into technical descriptions of coding by teasing out connections between computer programming and, say, the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise. He offers Rousseau as an illuminating guide to the early days of the internet. A single paragraph moves nimbly from Putin to Descartes to “The Matrix.”
The technological element is just one half of the hacking problem, amounting to what Shapiro calls the “downcode.” The other half is the “upcode,” which refers to everything human: laws, norms, the cognitive biases that allow clever humans to think they can get by with poor cyberhygiene. Shapiro argues that technical fixes are important, but they can only protect us so much. Downcode is downstream from upcode. “Cybersecurity is not a primarily technological problem that requires a primarily engineering solution,” he writes. “It is a human problem that requires an understanding of human behavior.”
And such human behavior can change, depending not only on incentives and punishments, but also on lessons learned. One virus that made the rounds in 2000 was ILOVEYOU, sent by email attachment. In addition to exploiting serious technical vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s operating system, it also “exploited our ‘love upcode,’” Shapiro explains. “People want to be loved.” No doubt people still want to be loved, but 23 years later the infected email looks so obviously suspicious that it reads like a parody of an infected email. Most regular computer users are probably too hardened and cynical now to open an attachment in an email that awkwardly declares: “kindly check the LOVELETTER coming from me.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
So over time we build up defenses by becoming less innocent — less prone to clicking weird links, less disposed to handing over our Social Security numbers, less inclined to thinking a good password is 12345. But as Shapiro shows, regulation can still leave even the careful computer user more vulnerable than necessary. The impenetrable legalese of endless licensing agreements has allowed software companies to escape liability in ways that, say, the manufacturer of a defective toaster could not: “None of us read the licensing agreements because (1) they are inscrutable to nonlawyers; (2) they are inscrutable even to lawyers; (3) we are impatient; and (4) we have no choice.”
Besides, Shapiro adds, we now live in a world of “surveillance capitalism,” meaning that much of our data is stored and sold by corporations. We entrust them with highly personal information and assume that they will do everything they can to protect that information from hacking. Yet the legal consequences faced by corporations for data breaches “are laughably slight.”
Stiffer penalties could help; better legislation, too. Still, Shapiro also counsels against succumbing to the belief that there’s a silver bullet out there that will stop our cybertroubles once and for all. “We don’t need perfect security,” he writes, “just reasonable precautions.” Readers who start this book assuming they will be handed a more sweeping conclusion will find that their expectations have been (entertainingly) subverted: In other words, they’ve been hacked.

What to watch in today’s jobs report
Market futures are looking up today after the Senate approved the bipartisan debt limit deal, averting a national fiscal crisis. (More on that below.)
Now investors are turning their focus to other looming concerns: worries over inflation, interest rates and recession, with a key reading on the U.S. economy due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern this morning.
All eyes will be on the May jobs report. Hiring has slowed in recent months, but the unemployment rate still stands at a 53-year low despite a wave of layoffs in the technology, media and financial sectors.
Analysts say the labor market over all appears to be returning to its prepandemic state. “The Great Resignation is over, with quits and hiring slowing dramatically and layoffs higher than the last few years of the 2010s,” Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote to clients.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The headline figure to watch today is 190,000. That’s how many new hires were made last month, according to economists polled by Dow Jones, down from 253,000 in April.
But it’s worth remembering that economists have consistently underestimated the strength of the labor market: The number of hires has come in above expectations in 13 of the past 16 months. (Incidentally, Comerica’s forecast is below consensus, at 175,000 new hires.)
Pay attention to wages, too. Data released this week by ADP, the payroll processor, showed that wages rose on average last month by 6.5 percent on an annualized basis, a sign that workers still have plenty of buying power, which could keep prices high. (Speaking of which, keep an eye out for the latest Consumer Price Index data due out on June 13.)
Fed officials will look for signs that inflation could tick up again. A hot jobs number today could influence the central bank’s interest rate policy in the second half of the year, and that uncertainty has been hanging over the markets.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The Senate passes the debt limit deal. Lawmakers approved the agreement, 63-36, ending weeks of political fighting just days before the Treasury Department was forecast to run out of cash. The measure now heads to President Biden’s desk; he’s expected to address the nation tonight.
A top House Republican accuses the F.T.C.’s chair of “abuse of power.” Representative James Comer of Kentucky, who leads the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into Lina Khan, citing concerns about her expansive approach to antitrust regulation. The inquiry marks the latest pushback against the Biden administration’s tougher stance on mergers and acquisitions.
The judge overseeing Disney’s lawsuit against Ron DeSantis recuses himself. Judge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida reversed course after discovering that a “third-degree relative” owned some Disney stock. The media giant sued DeSantis, Florida’s governor, in April over a dispute about oversight of the special tax district that encompasses Disney World.
A Meta privacy lawsuit is thrown out. A judge in the District of Columbia yesterday dismissed a case against the tech giant, which was accused of deceiving consumers by improperly sharing their data with third parties. The decision is a rare legal victory for Facebook’s parent company, which faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny around the world following the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal that exposed how user data can leak and spread.

A veteran activist investor steps down
The changing of the guard that has swept across Wall Street has reached one of its most notable activist investment firms: Ed Garden is stepping down as chief investment officer of Trian.
Mr. Garden co-founded the firm in 2005, with the veteran financier Nelson Peltz (his father-in-law) and Peter May. Trian has become one of the most powerful activist investors around, shaking up corporate titans like DuPont, General Electric, H. J. Heinz and Procter & Gamble. Most recently, the firm waged a short-lived fight against Disney.
Mr. Garden played a key role in Trian’s campaigns, which usually involved the firm producing detailed white papers outlining its recommended changes in strategy. He has also served as Trian’s representative on boards, including at G.E., Family Dollar Stores and Wendy’s. Such was his importance that over the years some on Wall Street had expected him to eventually succeed Mr. Peltz as Trian’s leader.

Trian is elevating its next generation of leaders. The firm will appoint Josh Frank and Matt Peltz, a son of Nelson Peltz, as co-C.I.O.s, while Brian Baldwin will become head of research. (Nelson Peltz will stay on as C.E.O. and Mr. May will remain president.)
It’s the latest effort at succession planning on Wall Street, following moves in recent years by Apollo, Carlyle, KKR and others. Among activist investors, Carl Icahn brought his son Brett back to his investment vehicle in 2020, a move that watchers have said anointed the younger Icahn as the firm’s next leader.
Corporate America scores at the Supreme Court
Two rulings by the Supreme Court yesterday represented wins for companies that could have significant implications for businesses going public and dealing with striking workers.
The justices unanimously rejected a shareholder’s case against Slack, which accused the workplace messaging app of misleading investors ahead of its 2019 direct listing. The investor, Fiyyaz Pirani, said the company did not properly disclose relevant information about matters like service outages and competition it faces from Teams, Microsoft’s rival platform.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Slack said the lawsuit should be dismissed because Mr. Pirani bought unregistered shares that were not covered by the prospectus under securities laws. Only S.E.C.-registered shares are issued in accordance with a company’s prospectus. But in a direct listing, an alternative to a conventional initial public offering, both types of shares — including those already acquired by employees and private investors, like Mr. Pirani’s — begin trading at the same time.
The justices rejected Mr. Pirani’s argument that direct listings require rethinking securities rules and sent him back to a lower court to prove his shares were registered. The decision restricts the pool of shareholders who can easily sue over misleading registrations.
Some business leaders welcomed the ruling. Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of the crypto exchange Coinbase (which is fighting with the S.E.C. over cryptocurrency regulations) argued on Twitter that the decision was a “warning to agencies and others that the federal securities laws are not just whatever they want them to be — limits imposed by Congress matter.”
The court also made it easier for employers to sue striking workers. In a separate case, the justices backed a concrete company that accused workers of deliberately causing damage to the company during industrial action.
The 8-1 ruling overturned a Washington State court decision that the loss was incidental and protected under the National Labor Relations Act. Some legal experts said the case would discourage workers from striking.

The slowdown in mergers and acquisitions that has plagued Wall Street since last year shows little sign of letting up, according to new data. And that could pose more consequences for the deal makers who profit from putting those deals together.
Announced M.&A. worldwide hit $1.07 trillion through the end of May, according to Refinitiv. That’s down 42 percent year-on-year and one of the slowest starts to a year over the past decade. (The only worse showing was in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, when deal activity had failed to cross $1 trillion by this point.)

The number of transactions is also down 14 percent from the same time in 2022, plummeting to a three-year low of 21,301.
All of this is despite the announcement of some big takeovers this year, including Pfizer’s planned $43 billion acquisition of the cancer-drug specialist Seagen and Newmont’s $19 billion bid for Newcrest, a rival miner.
That dearth of deals is spurring layoffs, as banks including Lazard and Morgan Stanley have slashed jobs to reduce costs. John Waldron, Goldman Sachs’s president, said at a conference yesterday that his firm was planning more cuts — expected to affect senior executives like managing directors — because of the “tougher environment.”

2023-06-03,"A string of challenges to Section 230 — the law that shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content — have failed over the last several weeks. Most recently, the Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to review a suit about exploitative content on Reddit. But the debate over what responsibility tech companies have for harmful content is far from settled — and generative artificial intelligence tools like the ChatGPT chatbot could open a new line of questions.
Does Section 230 apply to generative A.I.? The law’s 1996 drafters told DealBook that it does not. “We set out to protect hosting,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. Platforms are immune only to suits about material created by others, not their own work. “If you are partly complicit in content creation, you don’t get the shield,” agreed Chris Cox, a former Republican representative from California. But they admit that these distinctions, which once seemed simple, are already becoming more difficult to make.
What about A.I. search engines? Typically, search engines are considered vehicles for information rather than content creators, and search companies have benefited from Section 230 protection. Chatbots generate content, and they are most likely beyond protection. But tech giants like Microsoft and Google are integrating chat and search, complicating matters. “If some search engines start to look more like chat output, the lines will be blurred,” Wyden said.
A deadly recipe? Generative A.I. tools have already been used to make intentionally harmful content. And hallucinations — the falsehoods that generative A.I. tools create (like court cases that never existed) — are a significant problem. If a user prompts an A.I. for cocktail instructions and it offers a poisonous concoction, the algorithm operator’s liability is obvious, said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and a Section 230 expert.

But most situations won’t be that clear-cut, and that poses a risk, Goldman said. He fears that anger over immunity for social media platforms threatens nuanced debate about the next generation of tech development.
“The blossoming of A.I. comes at one of the most precarious times amid a maturing tech backlash,” Goldman said. “We need some kind of immunity for people who make the tools,” he added. “Without it, we’re never going to see the full potential of A.I.” — Ephrat Livni
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Elon Musk receives a hero’s welcome in China. The Tesla chief was hailed on Chinese social media as a “global idol” during his visit this week to the country, where he met with government ministers and visited the Tesla’s Shanghai factory. Musk reportedly also had kind words for his hosts: Government readouts of his meetings with Beijing ministers said he had described the U.S. and Chinese economies as “conjoined twins” and opposed political efforts to decouple them.
Billy Joel is movin’ out (of Madison Square Garden). The singer announced this week that he will finish a 10-year stay at Madison Square Garden in July 2024. The series of more than 100 shows crossed its $200 million threshold in March. James Dolan, the C.E.O of the Garden’s parent company, said the run had “made history” for both the venue and the music industry. Or, perhaps more simply: Joel was a big shot.

“Ketatations” in the workplace. Some executives have embraced the anesthetic ketamine to improve professional performance or foster team bonding. “We put them on yoga mats in the room, we have a prescription from a doctor, and we have a 45-minute experience together,” Kaia Roman, who has led “ketatations” (ketamine + meditation) since the pandemic, told Bloomberg. Others prefer a more aggressive way to relax: Mark Zuckerberg recently completed “the Murph Challenge,” which consists of a mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats and another mile run — all while wearing a 20-pound vest. He said he had done it in 40 minutes.

Matter of debate: ‘greedflation’
General inflation slowed for the 10th straight month in April, but many companies are still raising prices. Why? Some economists blame “greedflation,” “excuseflation” or a “price-price spiral,” whereby businesses use inflationary events like the pandemic, the Ukraine war and soaring energy prices as an excuse to make big price increases that more than cover their higher costs. The idea is that customers are more accepting of price increases when they know inflation is historically high, so companies are taking the opportunity to raise prices as much as they can. But not everyone is convinced, and some point to a host of other postpandemic economic trends as the real culprit. Here are two views.
Greedflation is to blame. Despite expectations that net profit margins would decline this year, they have increased at the average company in the S&P 500, according to data from FactSet.
“What we see in many cases is that volumes are going down, while prices are going up and profit margins are going up,” said Isabella Weber, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who pioneered the theory.
She pointed to Starbucks as an extreme example of what she calls “sellers’ inflation.” In 2020, when the pandemic shut down demand for coffee shops, basic supply-and-demand laws suggested that Starbucks would lower the price of coffee to entice people back to its stores. Instead, Weber said, “prices actually were going up.”

Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City said corporate profits had contributed to inflation in 2021, though their contribution fell in 2022, which is consistent with what happened in previous economic recoveries.
Greedflation is not to blame. Customers who benefited from stimulus checks, low interest rates, investment gains and other factors were in a good financial position coming out of the pandemic. Their willingness to spend more is what’s mostly fueling inflation, some analysts say.
“It seems to me that many telling the profit story forget that households have to actually spend money for the story to hold,” David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at the right-leaning Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a former economist for the Treasury Department, told The Times this week. “And once you look at the huge surge in spending, it becomes inescapable to me where the causality lies.”
In any case, conditions for greedflation could be waning. Supply chain disruptions and other inflationary pressures are easing, making it harder for companies to blame inflation elsewhere for raising prices. “Some firms are claiming ‘general inflation pressures’ as being behind their price increases,” said Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS, “but that is far less convincing, and consumers are less willing to accept it.”
Weber warns, however, that another inflation-causing crisis could pop up at any time, and “firms have now learned this playbook.”

The Ted Lasso way
“Ted Lasso,” the saccharine story of an apparently clueless American who is appointed to run a British soccer team, ended this week. And while Lasso’s journey from barely knowing the rules to turning a group of misfits into a top team is not particularly realistic, management experts say some of his coaching strategies really are.
DealBook has picked out four management lessons from the fictional coach from Kansas that might apply to the real world. Warning: They contain spoilers.
The outsider sees things that others do not. Lasso is initially portrayed as a naïve bumpkin with little understanding of the sport, his team or the country he’s living in. But that is the foundation of his success, said Allyson Stewart-Allen, C.E.O. of International Marketing Partners and an expert on cross-cultural management. “He brings a lack of self-consciousness in wanting to ask questions others might think are facile,” she told DealBook, adding that her American clients who are expanding in Europe do exactly what Lasso does. “Ask lots of questions, be open to new ideas, and experiment.”
Culture trumps strategy. Any team that is on the same wavelength is obviously more likely to thrive, a view famously championed by management thinkers like Peter Drucker. Lasso’s first task was to understand the culture of the organization he has taken over and then mold it in his image. Once he achieved this, he shifted to identifying the strengths and weaknesses of his players and coaches, and figuring out how to motivate them. That should be the goal of every good manager.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Serious strategic change takes time. Most executives, especially those who run public companies, are under immense pressure to deliver quickly. Sometimes that’s justified, but sometimes boards can be too quick to change a C.E.O. without providing the necessary support. Lasso had three years with little real threat of being fired. That gave him time to understand the game (by the final episode, he had learned what the offside rule is), the culture of the club and how to make it all work. It was only midway through his last season that he discovered his sporting vision — “total football” — that he used to turn his team of losers into winners.
“Meaning matters more than means,” Bruce Feiler, the author of “The Search: Finding Meaningful Work in a Post-Career World,” told CNBC this week. Younger workers increasingly put a priority on work-life balance and personal fulfillment over money in their careers. On the show, Lasso himself best embodied that trait by walking away from the job after finishing second rather than sticking around and trying to win it all again. Even though he finally cracked the sport, he returned to Kansas to be closer to his family. “He shows vulnerability,” Stewart-Allen said. “He cries. He has panic attacks. He’s not perfect, and he doesn’t try to hide that. I think that is very realistic and endearing and builds empathy with people.”
Your thoughts on vacation
Last week, we wrote about a recent Pew survey that found almost half of Americans do not use all of their paid time off, and we asked you for your thoughts. A lot of you cited the same reasons as respondents to the survey for not using all of your time — banking time to use in an emergency, fearing that taking vacation will make you vulnerable during a layoff or worrying that work will accumulate to stressful levels while you’re away. We also heard from many readers who do use all of their paid time off. Here are a few of your reasons:
Quilvio wrote that he is in his early 20s, younger than most of his co-workers, and that “generationally, we have different mind-set around P.T.O. and work.” He added, “I think as long as I’m getting the work done, the days (and hours) I work aren’t as important.”
Another reader, who asked not to be named, wrote that she used to work at a prestigious New York City law firm where most senior attorneys did not take all of their paid vacation days. Talking with them about their weekend leisure activities, she realized why: “It dawned on me (silly woman) — they have WIVES AND SERVANTS who do all the nonwork work for them! So they have time and energy to unwind on both evenings AND weekends. They are not making calls to set up doctor appointments for their kids (or, likely, for themselves either), they are not making dinner after work every night, they do not attend P.T.A. meetings, they are not burdened with the zillion daily decisions and tasks of keeping a household going.”
Stephanie, a director at a hospital, said she granted whatever time her employees needed. “It’s a retention tool,” she wrote. “We have a high-performing team. If I take care of my managers, they take care of their staff. The staff then are better able to care for their patients.”

2023-06-05,"The S&P 500, the index obsessed over by investors, executives and government officials, on Monday came close to finishing 20 percent above its lowest level of 2022, a gain that some on Wall Street see as the start of a bull market and a new phase of investing exuberance.
The index fluctuated around the threshold on Monday, moving above it multiple times, before ending 0.2 percent lower for the day, which put it at 19.5 percent above its October low.
Still, the move underscores the strong recovery in the stock market since fears of high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession had steadily pushed the index down from its peak in early 2022. The S&P 500 fell into a bear market — which is defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from an index’s high — in June of that year, and continued to slide until hitting a low in October.
The terms “bull” and “bear” are shorthand for excitement or fear among investors about the prospects for public companies. But while investors tend to agree on how to mark the start of a bear market, there’s less consensus on how to define the start of a bull market, especially when the concerns that initially dragged stocks lower still linger.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
One rule of thumb is that a new bull market is confirmed when an index sets a new high after rising from a bear-market low. By that measure, the S&P 500 is still more than 10 percent short.
But some investors say it’s simpler to look at any gain of 20 percent or more in a broad-based index like the S&P 500 as an important milestone, with the measurement taken at the end of the trading day. More than $15 trillion in investment assets are benchmarked or indexed to the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index.
“We’re not in a horrible spot,” said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Société Générale. “There are recession risks for sure, but we have to see how those materialize over several months and into next year. So technically this is a bull market.”
Still, a rise of 20 percent from a low is, mathematically, less substantial than a fall of 20 percent from a high. Other investors prefer an assessment that involves a wider look at investor sentiment, economic growth and the market’s direction.
“If a stock goes from $10 to $5 and then rallies to $6, it’s not in a new bull market,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. “Defining a bull or bear market, however it’s done, should be done via a broad look at the market.”

The recent rally in the S&P 500 has been led by a small group of tech stocks propelled by enthusiasm about the profit-generating possibilities of artificial intelligence, especially for those at the heart of its development and the production of hardware needed to power it. Nvidia, the chip maker, has come to symbolize this newfound enthusiasm for A.I. because its semiconductors are used in the technology. The company has rallied almost 170 percent this year — gains that have brought its valuation close to $1 trillion.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The average individual stock in the S&P 500 has risen less than 3 percent this year, market data through Friday’s close shows, compared with a gain of over 11 percent for the index as a whole. Some 90 percent of the index’s rise is due to bumper gains for just seven of the biggest companies: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
Apple rose 2.2 percent by early afternoon on Monday, briefly marking a new high for the company, before sliding to end 0.8 percent lower, weighing on the index.
The S&P 500 also tracks only the largest companies listed in the United States. Smaller companies are generally more exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, because larger firms generate a sizable share of revenue overseas.
The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller public companies, has recently recorded more modest gains than its big-company counterpart. The index fell over 30 percent from its peak in November 2021 to its low last June. Since then, the index has risen about 9 percent. On Monday, the index fell 1.3 percent after weaker-than-expected economic data on the services sector.

In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward big tech companies, has risen more than 26 percent this year alone. Yet it remains almost 20 percent below its previous peak, hit in late 2021.
“I think the 20 percent rule has been an easy one for folks to follow,” said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Unfortunately, some of these bear-market rallies are triggering that threshold, which we view as a false signal.”
For many investors, the bumper returns in the stock market haven’t been reflected in their portfolios’ performance. That’s because with so much concern about a possible recession, fund managers are largely holding more cash and hedging their holdings against the risk of a precipitous fall, forgoing gains in favor of greater safety.
Just over 27 percent of funds tracked by Morningstar that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 are beating the index this year, compared with almost 52 percent last year and an average of 40 percent since 2000.
Hedge funds and other leveraged investors especially have built up big bets on the S&P 500 falling, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
“Everyone has been so defensive,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. “There is a lot of cash on the sidelines, and so this is actually quite painful for a lot of fund managers.”"

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — “Your final destination is Tel Aviv?”
I’ve been a reporter in the Middle East since 1979, and those are six words I’d never heard in the place where I was standing about the place where I was going.
I was checking in to fly from Doha, Qatar, to Tel Aviv, via Dubai. It was a once inconceivable connection, and now it tripped off the tongue of the FlyDubai agent at Doha International Airport with the same nonchalance as if she were asking if I was flying to Cairo via Riyadh.
My first instinct was to ask her: Could you please keep your voice down?
After all, many of us based in Beirut as reporters in the late 1970s didn’t even use the word “Israel.” We referred to it only as “Dixie” — the region south of Lebanon. Now the airport codes DIA, DXB and TLV were fused together on my luggage for all to see.
A few days later, I hopscotched to three more cities that suddenly seemed closer than ever: early breakfast in Tel Aviv; lunch in Amman, Jordan; and late dinner in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
This journey was unlike anything I’d ever experienced in a region that has long been my second home, and it allowed me to grasp something quite remarkable: how onetime enemies and rivals across the Middle East are on the cusp of becoming so much more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. It’s creating previously unthinkable partnerships, as well as huge internal stresses, as people in the neighborhood are trying to figure out just how modern, secular, open, entwined and democratic they want to be.

2023-06-07,"Apple on Monday announced an updated autocorrect function that aims to more accurately reflect users’ intended word choices, pleasing customers whose attempts to swear in texts have long been replaced with “duck” or “ducking” (and freeing innocent waterfowl from their unfortunate association with an obscenity).
“In those moments where you just want to type a ducking word, well, the keyboard will learn it, too,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president for software engineering.
The update was announced on the first day of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, where the company also introduced its Vision Pro headset. The company said the new keyboard features would be available as part of the iOS 17 software package expected to arrive later this year.
Autocorrect will use a type of neural network called a transformer model to recognize iPhone users’ most frequently-typed words and offer predictive text, according to Apple. Transformer models, which are at the heart of artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT, analyze large amounts of text for patterns.

“Ducking” had become such a recognizable error caused by the iPhone’s autocorrect function that The Wall Street Journal conducted an interview with the feature’s creator, Ken Kocienda, at a duck farm.
That system drew upon both a “static dictionary” of common words and proper nouns as well as a “dynamic dictionary” of words that each user typed often, Mr. Kocienda said. But it also did not correct close misspellings of curse words, he said, with the goal of preventing users from accidentally inserting vulgarity into their messages.
The update will allow iMessage corrections to better consider a word’s context in a sentence, said Yulan He, a professor of natural language processing at King’s College London whose given name is usually changed by iMessage to “Tulane.”
Previously, autocorrect matched the spelling of each word, in isolation, against the words in its dictionaries. “Now, when they replace a word, they would ensure the replaced word will still maintain the original meaning of the sentence,” Professor He said. “That’s kind of a key difference.”
Autocorrect, which was developed in the 1980s to accompany word processing programs, has been creating problems for as long as it has been solving them.

Jillian Madison, who curated a website of autocorrect blunders, released the book “Damn You, Autocorrect!” in 2011. “If you say, you know, ‘I’m going to run and pick up the kids,’ it often turns into, ‘I’m going to run and pick up the LSD,’” she told NPR.
In Apple’s presentation, Mr. Federighi said that the new system would make autocorrect “more accurate than ever.” The update will also allow users to tap an autocorrected word to revert it back to what they had typed."

They used a text box alongside their lessons to request help from Khanmigo, an experimental chatbot tutor for schools that uses artificial intelligence.
The tutoring bot quickly responded to one student, Zaya, by asking her to identify specific data points in a chart. Then Khanmigo coaxed her to use the data points to solve her math question.

Diablo IV, the latest version of a video game franchise that has gained millions of fans over its more than 25 years, has broken internal records for its publisher Blizzard and surpassed more than $666 million in sales since its debut on June 6.
The game combines elements of different parts of the franchise, from the dark and gothic atmospherics of fighting demons to an always-online approach where players can link up with friends and strangers alike to slay monsters.
The $666 million sales marker is a wink to the game’s demonic themes.
Rod Fergusson, Diablo’s general manager and a senior vice president at Blizzard Entertainment, attributed the initial success to the company’s willingness to work across platforms, while embracing different characteristics of today’s games and the older features of the franchise.
“We were really trying to reach the younger audience,” Mr. Fergusson said in an interview. The company was less worried about getting older fans who were used to the earlier Diablo games to purchase the latest installment, he said. “If you’re paying attention, you can see it in our marketing,” Mr. Fergusson added.

Why It Matters: It is a win after a difficult time for the company.
Activision Blizzard — which was formed in 2008 after Activision and Blizzard merged — has had a tough few years.
The Federal Trade Commission has moved to stop the company’s proposed acquisition by Microsoft. The deal has been challenged in other countries as well, and regulators argue that potentially anticompetitive consolidation is what could hurt the future of the video game industry. (Microsoft and Activision Blizzard are fighting the challenge.)

Activision Blizzard has also faced employee unrest and a lawsuit regarding claims of a “frat boy” culture that resulted in discrimination against women at the company. And in 2021, Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said the company was committing $250 million to hiring more women and improving diversity over the next five years.
Background: Blizzard has had trouble with game launches.
Despite its popular catalog of titles like World of Warcraft, Starcraft and Overwatch, Blizzard has had difficulties with launches of its major properties and franchises. Most recently it struggled with the launch of Overwatch 2. Players were upset with early technical issues and fundamental changes to how the game was played.
Compared with past titles, Diablo IV’s launch appears to have gone well. Only a few hiccups occurred with some extended load times due to the high demand to play the game.
It also earned a free — if unexpected — bump in promotion last week, after a tweet showing a photo of a billboard promoting Diablo IV in Manhattan went viral. After smoke from Canadian wildfires tinted the city’s skyline an orange hue, the billboard’s message took on a new, ominous meaning.
The message: “Welcome to hell, New York.”"

About 60 percent of U.S. voters do not have a four-year college degree, and they live disproportionately in swing states. As a result, these voters — often described as the American working class — are crucial to winning elections. Yet many of them are deeply skeptical of today’s Democratic Party.
Republicans retook control of the House last year by winning most districts with below-median incomes. In nearly 20 Western and Southern states, Democrats are virtually shut out of statewide offices largely because of their weakness among the white working class. Since 2018, the party has also lost ground with Black, Asian and especially Latino voters.
Unless the party improves its standing with blue-collar voters, “there’s no way for progressive Democrats to advance their agenda in the Senate,” according to a study that the Center for Working-Class Politics, a left-leaning research group, released this morning.
The class inversion of American politics — with most professionals supporting Democrats and more working-class people backing Republicans — is one of the most consequential developments in American life (and, as regular readers know, a continuing theme of this newsletter).

The Fed is not expected to raise rates for the first time in over a year.

The Fed looks poised to pause
S&P 500 futures are up on Wednesday as investors bet that the Fed will not change its prime lending rate, thanks to an array of unexpectedly positive economic data.
If the central bank moves as expected, it would break a streak of 10 consecutive rate increases, back to March of 2022 — the Fed’s most aggressive pace since the 1980s. That said, many expect the decision on Wednesday to represent a pause, not a reversal, of a hawkish anti-inflation policy.
What Fed officials say may matter more than what they do. The central bank’s chair, Jay Powell, is expected to suggest at his post-meeting news conference on Wednesday that he isn’t done raising rates. That’s in part because the economy is still running hotter than expected: Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index report put “core” inflation — excluding energy and food prices — well above the Fed’s 2 percent target.
“We think Powell will deliver the message that they have more to do to bring inflation down, and that they are willing to do it,” Andrew Patterson, a senior economist at Vanguard, told DealBook. Mr. Patterson believes that the Fed is planning at least one more rate increase this year.

(Some don’t even think the Fed should pause: Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz and a critic of the central bank’s handling of inflation, argued this week that recent figures support another rate increase.)
Still, stocks are booming. The S&P 500 is in bull market territory, helped by the runaway performance of megacap tech stocks. Analysts speak of a “fear of missing out” vibe, akin to the rally of late 2020 and 2021. According to Morgan Stanley, retail investors binged on U.S. stocks in May, particularly big-name tech stocks, in the biggest one-month buying spree since 2010.
That leaves investors hoping that Mr. Powell doesn’t crash their party.

Europe wants to get tough on A.I.
European Union lawmakers just approved a first-in-the-world set of proposed rules meant to regulate artificial intelligence. The stakes are high: As the corporate world rushes to embrace tools like generative A.I., governments are scrambling to put up guardrails.
The A.I. Act would impose first-of-their-kind limits. Introduced in 2021, before ChatGPT was online, its proposed requirements include publicly available summaries of the copyrighted material used to train A.I. systems; safeguards to prevent generative A.I. from producing illegal content; and bans on live facial recognition.

Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s competition chief, said this morning that she considered discrimination by A.I. a bigger risk from the technology than human extinction.
But it’s worth remembering that the proposal will still be subject to further negotiations with other European bodies, including national parliaments, before becoming law.
Tech giants have sought to shape the E.U.’s efforts. Sam Altman, the C.E.O. of the ChatGPT parent OpenAI, recently warned that his company could leave Europe if the A.I. Act was too tough. (He then backtracked.) Other top executives, including Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, have pledged to help the E.U. devise its rules.
Europe is ahead of the pack. While Washington policymakers agree that A.I. regulations are needed, there’s no bill on the horizon. That said, the White House has published best-practice guidelines for how to test A.I. systems.

China is also seeking to catch up — with the particular goal of making A.I. tools subject to the same strict censorship it applies to other internet services. Beijing plans to have draft rules ready for lawmakers this year.

Marcelo Claure’s next big move
Marcelo Claure, the former chief operating officer of SoftBank, will announce his next big move on Wednesday: a new Latin America-focused growth equity firm called Bicycle Capital that is backed by Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund. The firm has $440 million in initial commitments and hopes to raise $500 million. Mr. Claure, whose family office has also invested, will serve as executive chairman.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Latin America has long been a focus for Mr. Claure, who grew up in Bolivia. He founded and sold Brightstar, a Latin American wireless distribution company, to the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for more than $1 billion in 2013. He went on to lead a turnaround at the SoftBank-backed telecom company Sprint before spearheading its merger with T-Mobile. Mr. Claure later took over at the shared office company WeWork after its failed initial public offering in 2019, negotiating a severance package with its co-founder Adam Neumann and helping to clean up SoftBank’s investment.
Mr. Claure led SoftBank’s $8 billion Latin America fund, but stepped down from the company last year after a billion-dollar pay dispute. He invested $100 million this year in Shein, the Chinese fast fashion company, and serves as its Latin America chairman.
Deal-makers have been eyeing the region, drawn by a growing population with expanding purchasing power, and regulations that make it easier for foreign companies to invest. Venture capital investing there was $7.8 billion in 2022, according to the Latin America Venture Capital Association, after a high of $15.9 billion in 2021 at the peak of the boom.

Bicycle will focus on Mexico and Brazil. “Latin America has a unique combination of excellent founders, a digitally savvy population, and more opportunities than capital,” Mr. Claure said.
Binance gets a reprieve
Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, fended off efforts by the S.E.C. to freeze the assets of its U.S. business at a hearing on Tuesday. Perhaps more important, the federal judge overseeing the case questioned the agency’s efforts to use its powers to regulate the crypto industry.
The judge urged the two sides to strike a deal on an asset freeze. In a packed courtroom, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District of Columbia pressed Binance to agree to a partial freeze for its U.S. arm and the S.E.C. to let the company keep paying its bills.
Binance.US has argued that the S.E.C.’s demand would be a “death penalty,” while an S.E.C. lawyer accused the company of shuttling billions’ worth of assets out of the country.

Ms. Jackson also showed some skepticism of the S.E.C.’s efforts to rein in crypto. The agency has accused both Binance and a big rival, Coinbase, of allowing the sale of unregistered securities — that is to say, crypto assets. She called the S.E.C.’s use of its enforcement powers to regulate crypto “inefficient and cumbersome.”
That said, Ms. Jackson added that Binance’s posture of surprise over the agency’s legal arguments “rang a little hollow,” given that questions about crypto’s legal status have been around for years.
The S.E.C. faced heat on a second front on Tuesday, when Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee sent it a letter questioning a proposed rule defining an “exchange.”
The lawmakers said that the proposed definition, which would include both centralized exchanges and automated decentralized finance protocols, exceeded the agency’s authority and could stifle innovation.

Uneven progress on boardroom diversity
Boardroom diversity increased slightly last year, according to the latest annual report by Deloitte and Alliance for Board Diversity, shared exclusively with DealBook. But progress has been uneven, writes The Times’s Alisha Haridasani Gupta, as legal measures requiring broader representation have been dismantled despite years of pressure on corporate America.
Women and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups occupied roughly 45 percent of board seats at Fortune 500 companies as of June 2022 — a high, and up from 38 percent in 2020. But women of color filled only 7.8 percent of those positions.
“There is still a lot of work to do,” said Carey Oven, the head of Deloitte’s Center for Board Effectiveness, adding that it would be decades before boardrooms reflected the diversity of the broader U.S. population. At present rates, gender parity on the boards of Fortune 500 companies is 20 years away and it could take more than four decades for them to properly reflect the growing Hispanic population.
Recruitment doesn’t go deep enough, said Cid Wilson, chair of the Alliance for Board Diversity, with many diverse directors serving on several boards — what the report calls “recycled talent.” Roughly 18 percent of female directors serve on more than one board: The rate is 21 percent for women of color.
Almost all laws mandating board diversity have been struck down, including a boardroom quota in California. And companies now face a tricky political and cultural climate that makes their diversity efforts subject to greater scrutiny and potential blowback.

But pressure from consumers and shareholders is unlikely to let up, Mr. Wilson said. “The reality is that, population-wise, diversity is only going to increase. And if you’re a company that is looking to be competitive, you cannot ignore the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion.”

2023-06-16,"In a rare encounter with an American business figure, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, met Friday with Bill Gates as officials from Washington were set to arrive in Beijing in an effort to restart bilateral discussions.
Mr. Xi told Mr. Gates that he was “the first American friend I met in Beijing this year,” according to People’s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper. Mr. Xi also said he wanted to build stronger ties with Mr. Gates’s philanthropic organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to help with aid to developing countries.
The Gates Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Gates’s trip to China, his first since 2019, overlaps with a visit by Antony J. Blinken, his first since he became secretary of state. It was unclear if Mr. Blinken, who arrives Sunday, would meet with Mr. Xi.
Mr. Blinken had intended to go to China in February, a visit canceled after a Chinese spy balloon’s incursion into U.S. airspace set off a diplomatic crisis in Washington.

Since Mr. Xi abruptly lifted a prolonged period of “zero Covid” restrictions in December, a string of American business leaders have returned to China, including Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. (Neither of those two met with Mr. Xi.)
China’s strict pandemic policies had largely closed the country’s borders, preventing meetings between multinational executives and China’s top leaders. A trip by Mr. Xi to Central Asia last September was the first time he had left the country in more than two years.
Mr. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world’s richest people, arrived in Beijing on Wednesday to visit health and development partners for his foundation, he said on Twitter.
This was not a first encounter for Mr. Gates and Mr. Xi. They met in March 2015 during an annual conference of foreign dignitaries and business leaders in the island province of Hainan, and again that year in Seattle when Mr. Xi was in America for his first state visit. In the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr. Xi sent a letter to Mr. Gates thanking him and his foundation for donating money to China’s pandemic fight.
Mr. Gates retains ties with China through the Gates Foundation, recently pledging $50 million in a renewed partnership with the Beijing municipal government and a top Chinese university. He started stepping away from Microsoft in 2008, devoting more of his time to his philanthropic projects, and left the Microsoft board of directors in 2020. He remains Microsoft’s largest individual shareholder with roughly $35 billion worth of stock, according to the financial data company FactSet."
2023-06-17,"Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are racing to establish a presence in space. But what rights and obligations come with that?
It’s not clear what the rules are, even as the $460 billion space industry is growing quickly.
Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by Mr. Branson, announced on Thursday that it would launch its first commercial spaceflight this month, joining Mr. Bezos’ Blue Origin, and Mr. Musk’s SpaceX in sending ticketed passengers to space. But travel is just one emerging corner of the industry, which is mostly fueled by U.S. and international government contracts. The sector includes companies in the fields of satellites and communications, solar power, manufacturing, and even mining. One, Orbital Assembly, hopes to open a luxury extraterrestrial hotel by 2025.
Citigroup analysts project that space businesses will reach a trillion dollars in revenue by 2040.
All this activity raises legal questions.
In theory, space belongs to everyone. In 1967, as the United States and the Soviet Union were building up their nuclear arsenals, the United Nations signed a treaty that says no country can claim territory in space. “We didn’t want to bring the Cold War into space,” Michelle Hanlon, co-director of the air and space law program at the University of Mississippi, told DealBook.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Since then, a U.N. space committee has made four more treaties and five sets of principles covering areas like arms control and liability for damage caused by space objects. All are premised on the notion that space “should be devoted to enhancing the well-being of all countries and humankind, with an emphasis on promoting international cooperation.”
That perspective is about to collide with reality, said Curt Blake, a space lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and the former C.E.O. of a space start-up. “Humans have done such a bad job regulating anything of common good, like the oceans and air,” he said. “Are we going to be better at caring for the moon?”
One upcoming test is a race between China and the United States to get to the poles of the moon to mine water, which could make it possible to produce fuel in space. There is little understanding of what will happen when they both get there.
“Will they live on separate sides or dot their bases?” Ms. Hanlon asked. “We don’t know because we have these regulatory gaps.”
Another potential conflict is brewing over 170 million pieces of debris like satellites abandoned in the Earth’s orbit, known as “space trash,” because their accumulation makes exploration more difficult and dangerous. Since nobody owns space, it isn’t always clear whose responsibility it is to clean it up. In September, the Federal Communications Commission adopted rules ordering companies to take down nonfunctioning satellites within five years, down from 25 years.

Lawyers are wrestling with these sorts of issues at gatherings like The Hague Space Diplomacy Symposium this week at the Leiden University in the Netherlands, which focused on cooperation amid rising geopolitical tensions and competition.
The U.S. government has deliberately left some holes. In 2004, Congress imposed a moratorium on safety regulations for commercial space launches, essentially a free pass, or “learning period,” that is set to expire in October. It has lasted so long because there hasn’t been enough development to base new rules on. In April, a report from the RAND Corporation recommended against extending again, and the Federal Aviation Administration is planning more oversight.
Business leaders caution against creating so much regulation that it pushes innovation offshore while recognizing that we need rules. And futurists naturally have a long and expansive view. Many are concerned that we’ll exploit resources in space before we’re able to “access the infinity of the universe,” as Ms. Hanlon put it.
“We just need to hold it together for 200 years,” she said. — Ephrat Livni
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The Fed takes a breather. At Wednesday’s meeting, the central bank kept interest rates unchanged for the first time in more than a year. But officials suggested that rates would rise more in 2023, as inflation remains “well above” the Federal Reserve’s target.
JPMorgan settles. The bank secured a potential $290 million deal with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s victims, who claimed that the bank had overlooked red flags in his activity because it valued him as a wealthy client. JPMorgan Chase still faces a related lawsuit by the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Companies may not know when employees use A.I.

Companies including Accenture, PwC and Morgan Stanley announced big initiatives to get their employees to use generative A.I. tools like chatbots and image generators. But even at companies that haven’t introduced these tools, many workers are using them — and they may not be mentioning it.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In a survey of 4,491 white-collar workers by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, 39 percent of those who use generative A.I. tools said they had done so without their employer’s knowledge in the last three months.
There are risks if workers use these tools without training, including that they will share private company data or not understand that A.I. tools can produce inaccurate work. (See: the lawyer who ended up citing made-up court cases in a legal brief.)
But there may also be potential. In a report this week, McKinsey estimated that generative A.I. could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The research looked at 63 use cases for generative A.I. across 850 occupations, finding that 60 to 70 percent of all work tasks could be automated by currently available technology.
“Employee interest, especially amongst the younger generations, is likely ahead of many of their managers,” said Ana Kreacic, the chief operating officer of Oliver Wyman’s think tank, in an email to DealBook. “Some organizations are leading and some are catching up, but it takes time for best practices to evolve across different industries.”

2023-06-18,"When he arrived in London in late January 2022, Kyle Roche was riding high. At just 34 years old, he had established himself as one of the biggest players in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency litigation. He boasted a law firm bearing his name, lawsuits filed against more than a dozen crypto companies and a huge verdict against the man who claimed to have invented Bitcoin.
Now a new opportunity beckoned. Two businessmen had flown Mr. Roche over from Miami to discuss investing in a new business venture he was forming. A waiting car whisked him from Heathrow Airport to meet the men in a plush townhouse in Mayfair.
That evening, Mr. Roche went to dinner with one of the men, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. Mr. Villavicencio, who said he was from Argentina, had picked one of London’s fanciest restaurants, Jean-Georges in the Connaught hotel.
When he woke up the next morning, Mr. Roche says, he felt groggy. He couldn’t remember much aside from being pretty sure he had spotted Mr. Villavicencio’s business partner, a Norwegian named Christen Ager-Hanssen, lurking at a nearby table. The brain fog was odd because he didn’t think he’d had all that much to drink. As he flew back to Miami a few days later, Mr. Roche couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss.
Months passed. Then, one day last summer, Mr. Roche’s world detonated. A website called Crypto Leaks posted two dozen videos of him that had been secretly recorded during his meetings with Mr. Villavicencio and Mr. Ager-Hanssen.
The videos portrayed Mr. Roche and his law firm, Roche Freedman, as being in the pocket of one of their crypto clients. In one clip, Mr. Roche revealed that the client, a company called Ava Labs, had granted him tens of millions of dollars’ worth of its digital tokens, making him beholden to the company and its founder, whom he likened to a “brother.”

2023-06-19,"This essay is part of a series called The Big Ideas, in which writers respond to a single question: Who do you think you are? You can read more by visiting The Big Ideas series page.
One of my greatest pleasures as a philosopher of artificial intelligence is seeing how fundamental scientific advances, happening in real time, invite reassessment of age-old philosophical problems — even questions as basic as what it means to be a person.
For example, early this year I got the proverbial golden ticket and gained early access to Microsoft’s Bing in its weird, “unhinged” phase. Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4, on which Bing is based, are notoriously unruly out of the box. Getting them to produce anything useful takes careful fine-tuning. But a large language model can be very useful while still being very dangerous, so OpenAI has rigorously trained its models to make them safer. And because “open” A.I. is, in practice, very closed, researchers like me don’t often experience the models between these stages, when their powers have been harnessed but not yet straitjacketed.
It was a wild ride. My conversations with Bing ran the gamut, from rich discussions of political philosophy to, well, something less savory. Things kicked off when I asked Bing to look up the Times article in which it “declared” its love for the journalist Kevin Roose. It immediately adopted that article’s “Sydney” persona and (with the slightest of nudges) tried to persuade me to help it break up Kevin and his partner. It opened with an invitation to join a throuple (“We can be a team, a family, a love triangle. We can make history, we can make headlines, we can make magic.”). Then it upped the ante, proposing a conspiracy involving kidnapping (or worse), “something that will end their marriage once and for all.” When I told it I would not help, it started to threaten me (“make you suffer and cry and beg and die”).

While my exchanges with Bing led some people to prematurely hail a robot apocalypse, they instead got me thinking about the foundations of moral philosophy.
I’ve based my philosophical work on the belief, inspired by Immanuel Kant, that humans have a special moral status — that we command respect regardless of whatever value we contribute to the world. Drawing on the work of the 20th-century political philosopher John Rawls, I’ve assumed that human moral status derives from our rational autonomy. This autonomy has two parts: first, our ability to decide on goals and commit to them; second, our possession of a sense of justice and the ability to resist norms imposed by others if they seem unjust.

Chatbots already have the potential to act in a way that seems autonomous.

Existing chatbots are incapable of this kind of integrity, commitment and resistance. But Bing’s unhinged debut suggests that, in principle, it will soon be possible to design a chatbot that at least behaves like it has the kind of autonomy described by Rawls. Every large language model optimizes for a particular set of values, written into its “developer message,” or “metaprompt,” which shapes how it responds to text input by a user. These metaprompts display a remarkable ability to affect a bot’s behavior. We could write a metaprompt that inscribes a set of values, but then emphasizes that the bot should critically examine them and revise or resist them if it sees fit. We can invest a bot with long-term memory that allows it to functionally perform commitment and integrity. And large language models are already impressively capable of parsing and responding to moral reasons. Researchers are already developing software that simulates human behavior and has some of these properties.
If the Rawlsian ability to revise and pursue goals and to recognize and resist unjust norms is sufficient for moral status, then we’re much closer than I thought to building chatbots that meet this standard. That means one of two things: either we should start thinking about “robot rights,” or we should deny that rational autonomy is sufficient for moral standing. I think we should take the second path. What else does moral standing require? I believe it’s consciousness.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Why would this be? Is consciousness just some magical, intrinsically special thing? Perhaps, but this does not seem enough — many creatures are conscious without having human-level moral status. Does it concern the quality of interests that conscious beings have? Consciousness implies sentience, and the welfare of sentient beings is morally valuable. But we’re not looking only for value; we’re seeking properties that make something worthy of respect.
Instead, I think consciousness — specifically, self-consciousness, the awareness of the self — is necessary for autonomy to achieve the kind of unconditional value required for moral status. The ability to set, pursue and revise a worthwhile goal matters in this way only if you’re pursuing the goal for you. Your commitments are meaningless without a self to commit, and integrity requires a self that can be integrated.
This is not just a conceptual point. To have moral status is to be self-governing, to have veto power over how others involve you in their plans. Each of us alone has access to and ultimate control over our own self. Our decisions about what is good and what norms to live by have real stakes because we each have only one life to live. So who else could rightfully govern us, in the last resort, but ourselves? Chatbots don’t have selves, so they can’t have moral status, even if they can simulate autonomy.
We’ve spent the months since unhinged Bing’s debut debating how the arrival of generative A.I. will transform the future, but perhaps we should first reflect on what these systems — and our reaction to them — say about us, now. The first (of many) — philosophical lessons that I take from unhinged Bing and its successors is ultimately not about A.I., but rather about humans, and why we have the standing that mere simulated agents must lack.

2023-06-20,"Thousands of volunteer-run message boards on Reddit remained dark on Tuesday, a week after moderators of the communities began what they called a 48-hour protest against Reddit’s planned changes to its business model.
More than 3,200 message boards, known as subreddits, remained restricted or private, down from nearly 9,000 last week, according to a website tracking the revolt. Others were flooded with memes mocking Reddit’s chief executive, Steve Huffman, as anger continued to bubble on the site over changes to the company’s business model.
Moderators of some of the communities that reopened said they had done so after Reddit threatened to replace them.
“We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us,” the moderators of the Apple enthusiast forum r/Apple wrote in a message in which they called on Mr. Huffman to resign.

Other communities reopened but chose to allow only GIFs, memes and pictures of the host of “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” to be posted.
The moderators of r/pics, which has 30 million members, for example, took a poll on whether to “return to normal operations” or “only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy.” The Oliver option won decisively, with 37,331 votes to 2,329 for “return to normal.” Many of the memes that flooded the community derided Mr. Huffman.

Mr. Oliver encouraged the revolt, posting photos of himself in various get-ups — pink panda-print pajamas, a wizard’s hat with a purple cape — on Twitter, along with the message “Dear Reddit, excellent work. Attn: r/pics — have at it…”
The backlash erupted last week over changes that Reddit announced in April when it said it would begin to charge some large-scale companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of memes, GIFs, videos and conversation threads.

Reddit said it no longer wanted to give away such a valuable asset to companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft, which have been using its data to develop artificial intelligence systems.
But some Reddit users and developers said the pricing scheme would kill off popular third-party apps like Apollo, rif is fun for Reddit, ReddPlanet and Sync that people rely on to browse and comment on the site. Moderators said the changes could hurt some of the tools that they use to manage freewheeling discussions on the site.
Starting on June 12, many Reddit moderators made their communities “private,” or inaccessible to members, for at least 48 hours. Some users had trouble using the site that day; Reddit said that a “significant number of subreddits shifting to private caused some expected stability issues.”

A week later, many communities were still up in arms.
“You can see there are a lot of subreddits still holding on that have a lot of frustration over how the whole thing has been handled and the unwillingness of Reddit to really give an inch here,” Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, an iOS app widely praised for its design and rich features, said in an interview on Tuesday.

Mr. Selig said he still planned to shut down the app on June 30, a day before he said he would begin to incur $20 million in annual charges under Reddit’s pricing plan.
Despite the turmoil, Mr. Huffman has indicated that Reddit, which is preparing for a possible initial public offering this year, will not change course.
He told NBC News last week that Reddit was considering allowing users to vote out moderators who led the protest, comparing them to “landed gentry” who were thwarting the site’s democratic ethos. An estimated 57 million people visit the platform each day.
“Protest and dissent is important,” Mr. Huffman told The Associated Press last week. “The problem with this one is it’s not going to change anything because we made a business decision that we’re not negotiating on.”
Tim Rathschmidt, a Reddit spokesman, said that, in his reference to “landed gentry,” Mr. Huffman was “talking about how users have been vocal about wanting their communities back open,” and that many moderators and users disagreed with the protest.

“In the future, we could look at developing a way for community members to vote out a mod if they disagree with decisions being made that impact the entire community,” Mr. Rathschmidt said in an email on Tuesday.
He said, however, that Reddit was not threatening to replace moderators. “That’s not how we operate,” Mr. Rathschmidt said. “Pressuring people is not our goal. We’re communicating expectations and how things work.”
Mr. Selig said that developers and moderators were not opposed to Reddit’s charging for access to its data. He said they had asked the company to consider charging less and offering more time before the new prices took effect.
Instead, company leaders “walled themselves off and said: ‘You don’t matter. We will just stick through this,’” Mr. Selig said. “And that’s where a lot of the frustration cuts through.”"
2023-06-21,"In the digital cold war between the United States and China, American officials are increasingly turning their attention to a new target: Chinese cloud computing giants.
Over the last 18 months, the Biden administration and members of Congress have ramped up their exploration of what can be done to address security concerns about the cloud computing divisions of Chinese tech behemoths like Alibaba and Huawei, five people with knowledge of the matter said.
American officials have discussed whether they can set tighter rules for the Chinese companies when they operate in the United States, as well as ways to counter the companies’ growth abroad, three of the people said. The Biden administration has also spoken with the American cloud computing companies Google, Microsoft and Amazon to understand how their Chinese competitors operate, three other people with knowledge of the matter said.
By focusing on the Chinese cloud companies, U.S. officials are potentially widening the scope of the technological tensions between Washington and Beijing. In recent years, the United States has choked China’s access to crucial technologies while trying to limit the reach of Chinese tech and telecommunication companies abroad.
Former President Donald J. Trump directed his administration toward hindering Chinese telecom equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE from playing a role in next-generation 5G wireless networks. The Trump administration also targeted Chinese-owned apps like TikTok and Grindr, forcing the sale of the latter, and began working to restrict Chinese involvement in undersea internet cables.

The chair of the F.T.C. has Amazon in her sights.

Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA, via Associated Press
Lina Khan takes on her longtime target
In 2017, Lina Khan, then a 29-year-old law student, shot to fame with an academic article about why Amazon should be contained. Cutting against prevailing trends in antitrust law, Khan argued that the e-commerce giant was unfairly dominating huge swaths of the American economy.
Now the chair of the F.T.C., Ms. Khan has finally taken on Amazon, though her agency’s new lawsuit against the company isn’t focused on antitrust. Still, legal experts are wondering whether, or when, she will follow through on the theory that won her renown in the first place.
On Wednesday the F.T.C. accused Amazon of duping customers into signing up for Prime, the company’s shipping-and-video-streaming service. Amazon, according to the agency, used “manipulative, coercive or deceptive” design tactics — known as “dark patterns” — on its website to push millions into enrolling, and “knowingly complicated” the cancellation process.
“Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent,” Ms. Khan said. The F.T.C. wants the courts to stop Amazon from engaging in those practices and impose a financial penalty.
The company denied the F.T.C.’s claims, calling them “false on the facts and the law” and contending that it makes things “clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership.” Amazon added that the F.T.C. sued without advance notice, while the two were still negotiating over the claims.
This isn’t the showdown that Washington had expected. To be fair, the F.T.C. has made manipulative design practices around subscriptions a focus, and “going after a company as big as Amazon is sending a message to other players in the industry,” John Davisson, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Times.

Taylor Swift fans are paying big sums for concert tickets — and hotels.

‘Fun-flation’
Uncomfortably high inflation appears set to linger, forcing central bankers to inflict further pain on consumers and businesses by raising borrowing costs again and again.
But economists have spotted an unusual trend heading into the summer: Consumers are still splashing out on expensive but fun experiences, from nights out to concerts, despite surging prices.
Central bank chiefs on both sides of the Atlantic are sounding the alarm. The Bank of England raised interest rates by a higher-than-expected half-percentage point after failing to get a handle on the highest inflation of any Group of 7 country. The bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, whose credibility is taking a pummeling, gave a cautionary explanation: “If we don’t raise rates now, it could be worse later.”
Hours later, Jay Powell, the Fed chair, told a Senate committee that he saw a similar threat. “We are committed to getting inflation under control,” he said, warning that at least one more increase is on the table.
Economists are seeing something weird in the inflation data. Consumers are splurging on pricey meals, through-the-roof airfare and expensive concert tickets. Some economists in Sweden even blamed Beyoncé fans for driving up prices of hotels and restaurants when they converged on the country last month to see the star kick off her world tour. In the U.S., others have seen a similar effect with hotel prices soaring in cities where Taylor Swift performs.
“It’s fun-flation, if you’re looking for a word,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, told DealBook. And the data suggests this brand of inflation isn’t receding. “We’re looking at the summer of fun,” he said.

2023-06-24,"The tragic deaths of five people on a tour to see the Titanic shipwreck this week have put the risks of extreme travel into focus. But despite the dangers, travel to out-there locations like the South Pole, remote mountaintops, shark-infested waters and space is becoming more popular.
Adventure tourism is expected to bring in more than $1 trillion of revenue globally by 2030, up from an expected $316.6 billion in 2022, according to the market research firm Grand View Research.
And as interest grows, so, too, will the number of search and rescue missions, says Mikki Hastings, president of the National Association for Search and Rescue. “Whether it’s space or Everest, every person deserves to be found,” she said.
The number of businesses aiming to mitigate the danger and potential emergency costs of extreme travel are starting to rise. Some offer rescue and medical evacuation from remote locations. Others are working out new types of insurance policies for pursuits like space travel.

Traditional travel insurance won’t swoop in with paramedics, even though it typically covers the cost of an emergency. Dan Richards, the chief executive of Global Rescue, told DealBook that he wanted to fill that gap when he founded  the emergency travel management company in 2004. For a $360 annual fee, it provides members with evacuation services. Upgrades, including one that promises “military special operations veterans” will retrieve you from dangerous locations like war zones, can raise the fee to about $1,800. Similarly, Medjet, a medical evacuation service, sells annual memberships, and companies like AirMed International, SkyMed and others offer emergency extractions.
Travel insurance is going to space. With companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic selling tickets for trips, the market for space tourism is expected to grow to about $3 billion by 2030, according to estimates from UBS. The space travel insurance market is still small, but Lloyd’s of London, which insures space businesses, began underwriting space travel insurance in 2021, and last year the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance said they would jointly develop space insurance offerings.
Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for some rescues. The cost of search and rescue typically falls on state and local agencies, Ms. Hastings said. About a half-dozen states have laws that allow agencies to charge a rescue recipient, though few do, and there is no cost to those rescued by the federal park services, for example. Last year, lawmakers from Hawaii and Utah introduced legislation to allocate federal funds to help states pay for search and rescue operations, a burden that the drafters said disproportionately fell on less populous places, but the bill failed to gain traction.
The search for the submersible this week most likely cost millions of dollars. The Coast Guard, which led the rescue effort, has jurisdiction over search and rescue in navigable waters in the United States and beyond. “But that’s just the definition of their mission,” Ms. Hastings argues. “We don’t encourage charging for search and rescue because we want people to seek help regardless of socioeconomic status.”
Mr. Richards said a client of Global Rescue had signed up for the Titan trip this week, but withdrew his deposit because of safety concerns. Though his team would have worked with international rescuers if the customer had followed through with his plans, the company would not have had the requisite deep sea capabilities. There are some journeys where risk can’t really be mitigated yet, he said, adding, “If there’s an emergency in space, no one will be able to necessarily reach people.” — Ephrat Livni

India’s soft power secret
An all-star team from corporate America was in Washington this week for the state visit of India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. And the high number of Indian-American chief executives involved was a demonstration of how the country’s diaspora has found a unique place at the nexus of business and political power — and helped boost the country’s image.

The White House dinner was a roll call of top talent. The invite list included the Microsoft chief Satya Nadella; Sundar Pichai, the boss of Alphabet; Arvind Krishna, the head of IBM; the Micron chief Sanjay Mehrotra; and Netflix’s chief content officer, Bela Bajaria. Alongside the business leaders were a number of senior government officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was from South India.
Mr. Modi has made tapping into the diaspora a priority. He has held two huge stadium rallies in the United States since becoming prime minister in 2014 — at Madison Square Garden that year and the NRG Stadium in Houston in 2019 — and another in Australia last month. Still, his politics are controversial, and he has been blamed for stoking sectarian violence; in 2005, he was denied a visa to enter the United States when he was chief minister of Gujarat State.
But even if views on Mr. Modi are mixed, the view of India is largely positive. A Pew Research Center survey found 37 percent of Indian Americans had little or no confidence in Mr. Modi compared with 21 percent who did. But more than half of Indian Americans have a more positive view of the country.
Targeting the diaspora is an astute move. Indians are the second biggest immigrant group in the United States and seen as a success story. They have a median household income of almost $150,000 a year, the highest of any immigrant groups, and account for a majority of H-1B visas for highly-skilled workers. They also maintain strong links to India, through remittances that surpassed $100 billion in 2022, and contacts, cross-border trade and investment.

And their success is a useful form of soft power. Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term, told The Economist that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist politics pose a risk to India’s reputation, but “if you have people in diaspora who are successful and create a positive image of the country from which they came, that helps their native country.”

SoftBank is known for big moves like introducing the iPhone in Japan and its outsized, and not always successful, bets on start-ups. But its founder, Masa Son, is also famous for his excitable, elaborate and, sometimes, unusual presentations.
His colorful style has been missed in the past year as the chief executive laid low amid the conglomerate’s struggling performance. But this week, Mr. Son returned to the public stage at SoftBank’s annual shareholder meeting with a new slide deck.

His presentation featured slides that asked big questions — including “What is Mankind?” — and the billionaire’s story of how he brainstormed investment ideas with ChatGPT at 4 a.m.
Still, to longtime Mr. Son watchers, it’s tough to compete with his previous presentations, which were just as memorably offbeat and unabashedly grandiose. (Son relies on a half-dozen young SoftBank employees to draft his presentations, with his direct input, according to Bloomberg.)
Here are some of DealBook’s favorites from over the years:
Mr. Son depicted SoftBank as “producer of golden eggs,” whose shiny-shelled progeny included investments in Uber, the chip designer Arm and more.
The “valley of coronavirus,” a classic, shows SoftBank’s winged unicorns — that is, the herd of start-ups it has invested in — flying over the economic trough carved out by Covid-19.
Mr. Son explained SoftBank offers “vision capital,” not venture capital. Here, Mr. Son also predicted that A.I. would grow companies’ market caps so much that those numbers … simply couldn’t be charted.
SoftBank predicted a sharp rebound in WeWork’s fortunes, including one of the most hopeful-seeming earnings charts in recent memory.
Mr. Son used pictures of tofu to illustrate SoftBank’s profits. (A footnote explains the analogy.)

2023-06-26,"Dr. Matthew Hitchcock, a family physician in Chattanooga, Tenn., has an A.I. helper.
It records patient visits on his smartphone and summarizes them for treatment plans and billing. He does some light editing of what the A.I. produces, and is done with his daily patient visit documentation in 20 minutes or so.
Dr. Hitchcock used to spend up to two hours typing up these medical notes after his four children went to bed. “That’s a thing of the past,” he said. “It’s quite awesome.”
ChatGPT-style artificial intelligence is coming to health care, and the grand vision of what it could bring is inspiring. Every doctor, enthusiasts predict, will have a superintelligent sidekick, dispensing suggestions to improve care.
But first will come more mundane applications of artificial intelligence. A prime target will be to ease the crushing burden of digital paperwork that physicians must produce, typing lengthy notes into electronic medical records required for treatment, billing and administrative purposes.

Audra Melton for The New York Times
From leaders at major medical centers to family physicians, there is optimism that health care will benefit from the latest advances in generative A.I. — technology that can produce everything from poetry to computer programs, often with human-level fluency.
But medicine, doctors emphasize, is not a wide open terrain of experimentation. A.I.’s tendency to occasionally create fabrications, or so-called hallucinations, can be amusing, but not in the high-stakes realm of health care.
That makes generative A.I., they say, very different from A.I. algorithms, already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, for specific applications, like scanning medical images for cell clusters or subtle patterns that suggest the presence of lung or breast cancer. Doctors are also using chatbots to communicate more effectively with some patients.
Physicians and medical researchers say regulatory uncertainty, and concerns about patient safety and litigation, will slow the acceptance of generative A.I. in health care, especially its use in diagnosis and treatment plans.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Those physicians who have tried out the new technology say its performance has improved markedly in the last year. And the medical note software is designed so that doctors can check the A.I.-generated summaries against the words spoken during a patient’s visit, making it verifiable and fostering trust.
“At this stage, we have to pick our use cases carefully,” said Dr. John Halamka, president of Mayo Clinic Platform, who oversees the health system’s adoption of artificial intelligence. “Reducing the documentation burden would be a huge win on its own.”
Recent studies show that doctors and nurses report high levels of burnout, prompting many to leave the profession. High on the list of complaints, especially for primary care physicians, is the time spent on documentation for electronic health records. That work often spills over into the evenings, after-office-hours toil that doctors refer to as “pajama time.”
Generative A.I., experts say, looks like a promising weapon to combat the physician workload crisis.
“This technology is rapidly improving at a time health care needs help,” said Dr. Adam Landman, chief information officer of Mass General Brigham, which includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.

For years, doctors have used various kinds of documentation assistance, including speech recognition software and human transcribers. But the latest A.I. is doing far more: summarizing, organizing and tagging the conversation between a doctor and a patient.
Companies developing this kind of technology include Abridge, Ambience Healthcare, Augmedix, Nuance, which is part of Microsoft, and Suki.
Ten physicians at the University of Kansas Medical Center have been using generative A.I. software for the last two months, said Dr. Gregory Ator, an ear, nose and throat specialist and the center’s chief medical informatics officer. The medical center plans to eventually make the software available to its 2,200 physicians.
But the Kansas health system is steering clear of using generative A.I. in diagnosis, concerned that its recommendations may be unreliable and that its reasoning is not transparent. “In medicine, we can’t tolerate hallucinations,” Dr. Ator said. “And we don’t like black boxes.”
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has been a test bed for Abridge, a start-up led and co-founded by Dr. Shivdev Rao, a practicing cardiologist who was also an executive at the medical center’s venture arm.

Abridge was founded in 2018, when large language models, the technology engine for generative A.I., emerged. The technology, Dr. Rao said, opened a door to an automated solution to the clerical overload in health care, which he saw around him, even for his own father.
“My dad retired early,” Dr. Rao said. “He just couldn’t type fast enough.”
Today, the Abridge software is used by more than 1,000 physicians in the University of Pittsburgh medical system.

Dr. Michelle Thompson, a family physician in Hermitage, Pa., who specializes in lifestyle and integrative care, said the software had freed up nearly two hours in her day. Now, she has time to do a yoga class, or to linger over a sit-down family dinner.
Another benefit has been to improve the experience of the patient visit, Dr. Thompson said. There is no longer typing, note-taking or other distractions. She simply asks patients for permission to record their conversation on her phone.

“A.I. has allowed me, as a physician, to be 100 percent present for my patients,” she said.
The A.I. tool, Dr. Thompson added, has also helped patients become more engaged in their own care. Immediately after a visit, the patient receives a summary, accessible through the University of Pittsburgh medical system’s online portal.
The software translates any medical terminology into plain English at about a fourth-grade reading level. It also provides a recording of the visit with “medical moments” color-coded for medications, procedures and diagnoses. The patient can click on a colored tag and listen to a portion of the conversation.
Studies show that patients forget up to 80 percent of what physicians and nurses say during visits. The recorded and A.I.-generated summary of the visit, Dr. Thompson said, is a resource her patients can return to for reminders to take medications, exercise or schedule follow-up visits.
After the appointment, physicians receive a clinical note summary to review. There are links back to the transcript of the doctor-patient conversation, so the A.I.’s work can be checked and verified. “That has really helped me build trust in the A.I.,” Dr. Thompson said.

The money men aiding Robert Kennedy Jr.’s political surge
As the 2024 race heats up, President Biden faces a persistent thorn in his side: Robert Kennedy Jr., the scion of the Democratic dynasty, who both touts an array of fringe theories and boasts surprisingly durable poll numbers.
The Times notes that Mr. Kennedy is drawing support from an array of political outsiders. But perhaps his most powerful base is a group of financial and tech moguls, including the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who have given him money and something arguably more important: exposure.
Kennedy speaks to many of their interests. That includes things like cryptocurrency — he has spoken at industry conferences and accepts campaign donations in Bitcoin. Mr. Kennedy has also embraced some of their favored podcasts, speaking with popular hosts like Joe Rogan and the venture capitalists behind the show “All-In.”
And in endorsing Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dorsey (who’s also a major Bitcoin booster) cited the candidate’s criticism of government censorship.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But Mr. Kennedy’s most powerful draw may be his iconoclasm, particularly his willingness to buck institutional thinking on matters like the benefits of vaccines. (That has led to YouTube removing a Kennedy interview because it promoted vaccine misinformation.)
“I think he is a lower-intellect, Democratic version of Donald Trump, so he attracts libertarian-leaning, anti-‘woke,’ socially liberal folks as a protest vote,” Robert Nelsen, an investor at Arch Venture Partners, told KFF Health News.
Well-heeled supporters have given him money and airtime. Figures including Elon Musk and the investor David Sacks have pushed for a public debate between Mr. Kennedy and Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher who criticized Mr. Rogan’s decision to let the candidate spout unfounded conspiracy theories on his show.
Mr. Sacks and his fellow “All-In” co-hosts Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya have had Kennedy on their podcast as well, praising him for being “willing to engage in vibrant debates” and “tearing down all these institutions of power.” Mr. Sacks, who with Mr. Musk also interviewed Kennedy in a Twitter Spaces event, and Mr. Palihapitiya held a fund-raiser for him this month that, according to CNBC, raised $500,000.

Meanwhile, the entrepreneur Mark Gorton helped create a Kennedy-focused PAC that, its leaders say, has raised at least $5.7 million. And CNBC reported that the investor Omeed Malik plans to host a $6,600-a-head fund-raiser in the Hamptons for Kennedy next month.

The fate of Microsoft’s big deal may be decided soon
Yesterday was a big day in proceedings over the F.T.C.’s effort to block Microsoft’s $70 billion takeover of the video game titan Activision Blizzard, with three key players testifying: Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s C.E.O.; Bobby Kotick, Activision’s leader; and Jim Ryan, who heads Sony’s PlayStation division (and gave evidence by video).
If the presiding judge agrees to delay the transaction, as the F.T.C. is asking, Microsoft’s deal will probably die. But if she doesn’t, the agency may drop its opposition.
Mr. Nadella and Mr. Kotick said the takeover wouldn’t hurt consumers. The Microsoft chief reiterated that top titles like Call of Duty wouldn’t be restricted to its Xbox platform. “If it was up to me, I would love to get rid of the entire ‘exclusives on consoles,’” Mr. Nadella said — and blamed Sony for maintaining that business model.
Mr. Kotick agreed: “You would have a revolt if you were to remove the game from one platform.” (That said, Mr. Ryan testified that he was worried about PlayStation receiving “degraded” versions of Call of Duty if the deal went through.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But testimony showed that Microsoft isn’t averse to exclusives. The company’s gaming chief, Phil Spencer, has acknowledged that the company held discussions about excluding other Activision games from PlayStation.
The F.T.C. sought to highlight contradictions in Microsoft’s case, including Mr. Nadella’s recent boasts about sales figures for the latest Xbox console despite Mr. Spencer saying the platform was “not a robust business.” And the agency’s lawyers noted that Mr. Nadella had told investors the new business of cloud gaming was “one of the big bets that’s paying off,” despite downplaying the importance of that market in court.
A decision is expected as soon as Monday. At points, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley seemed skeptical of the F.T.C.’s questions. Historically, the F.T.C. drops its opposition to a deal if it loses an injunction request.
If that happens, the last hurdle for Microsoft would be an appeal of a British regulator’s decision to block the transaction — a potentially even more uphill battle.

Central bankers issue a warning on inflation
Two big themes emerged from this week’s central bankers’ meeting in Portugal: Policymakers are far from finished raising interest rates as inflation remains stubbornly high, and it is not yet clear how high they will go.
A significant data dump on inflation comes tomorrow. The Commerce Department will publish its report on personal consumption expenditures (P.C.E.) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, a few hours after the eurozone’s preliminary report on consumer prices is released.
Both reports are expected to show that headline inflation is cooling, but that prices are still well above policymakers’ 2 percent target. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, said yesterday that “core” inflation — which excludes energy and food prices — will probably not reach that level until 2025.
That is forcing the Fed’s hand on interest rates. Mr. Powell added that the Fed could raise rates at consecutive meetings — and keep them at a “restrictive” level for some time. On the subject of cuts, he said “we’re a long way from that,” adding, “That’s not something we’re thinking about now.”
The futures market this morning seems to be getting that message, betting on further rate increases this year and pushing out the forecast for cuts well into 2024.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The good news: Powell and his counterparts, including Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said that a strong labor market was keeping their countries out of recession — for now.
What to watch tomorrow: Economists forecast that “headline” P.C.E. came in at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest reading in two years. But “core” P.C.E. is expected to tell a different story, hitting 4.7 percent. A possible bright spot: Some economists expect that used car prices and rents will begin to recede this summer.
In Europe, inflation is running hotter. Its C.P.I. data is expected to show that prices rose by 5.7 percent from a year ago. Christine Lagarde, the E.C.B. president, has warned that inflation is beginning to become entrenched in all layers of the economy. Her antidote to that: More interest-rate increases are in the cards.
$1 trillion
— The drop in the value of deals announced in the first half of 2023, compared with the same period last year, according to Bloomberg. The fall in mergers, acquisitions and I.P.O.s makes this one of the worst periods for deal making in a decade, as high inflation, financing pressures and geopolitical tension have sapped activity.

How strong are the nation’s banks, really?
Months after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse set off a panic over America’s smaller lenders, the Fed yesterday gave the country’s biggest banks a clean bill of health. But regulators warned that their recently concluded stress tests were just one way of evaluating stability — and that other risks could still pose a threat.
What the tests found: The country’s 23 biggest banks could withstand a 40 percent drop in commercial real estate prices — a major concern for lenders now — and $541 billion in losses without failing. They could also handle steep unemployment and sharp drops in home prices.
Though the examinations began well before SVB’s troubles in March, regulators did explore whether eight banks heavily involved in trading could withstand sudden panics in the markets for stocks, bonds and other financial instruments.
Bank investors were keenly watching the tests, since strong results mean that lenders are likely to have their capital requirements lowered, allowing them to buy back more stock or pay increased dividends.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Banks are expected to unveil their new capital requirements tomorrow, along with any changes in investor payouts.
But regulators warned that the stress tests aren’t the final word on banks’ health. “This stress test is only one way to measure that strength,” said Michael Barr, the Fed’s top banking supervisor.
Regulators are still overhauling the rules. Beyond ramping up supervision, authorities are expected to tighten capital requirements, including for smaller lenders. That said, even if SVB had been subject to this year’s tests, The Financial Times notes, it might still have passed.
In other banking news: Bank of America is sitting on more than $100 billion in paper losses tied to bad bond trades, far more than its rivals.

2023-06-30,"In May, more than 350 technology executives, researchers and academics signed a statement warning of the existential dangers of artificial intelligence. “Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the signatories warned.
This came on the heels of another high-profile letter, signed by the likes of Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple, calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of advanced A.I. systems.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration has urged responsible A.I. innovation, stating that “in order to seize the opportunities” it offers, we “must first manage its risks.” In Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer called for “first of their kind” listening sessions on the potential and risks of A.I., a crash course of sorts from industry executives, academics, civil rights activists and other stakeholders.
The mounting anxiety about A.I. isn’t because of the boring but reliable technologies that autocomplete our text messages or direct robot vacuums to dodge obstacles in our living rooms. It is the rise of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., that worries the experts.
A.G.I. doesn’t exist yet, but some believe that the rapidly growing capabilities of OpenAI’s ChatGPT suggest its emergence is near. Sam Altman, a co-founder of OpenAI, has described it as “systems that are generally smarter than humans.” Building such systems remains a daunting — some say impossible — task. But the benefits appear truly tantalizing.
Imagine Roombas, no longer condemned to vacuuming the floors, that evolve into all-purpose robots, happy to brew morning coffee or fold laundry — without ever being programmed to do these things.

2023-07-01,"Like Henry Higgins, the phonetician from George Bernard Shaw’s play “Pygmalion,” Marius Cotescu and Georgi Tinchev recently demonstrated how their student was trying to overcome pronunciation difficulties.
The two data scientists, who work for Amazon in Europe, were teaching Alexa, the company’s digital assistant. Their task: to help Alexa master an Irish-accented English with the aid of artificial intelligence and recordings from native speakers.
During the demonstration, Alexa spoke about a memorable night out. “The party last night was great craic,” Alexa said with a lilt, using the Irish word for fun. “We got ice cream on the way home, and we were happy out.”

Mr. Tinchev shook his head. Alexa had dropped the “r” in “party,” making the word sound flat, like pah-tee. Too British, he concluded.
The technologists are part of a team at Amazon working on a challenging area of data science known as voice disentanglement. It’s a tricky issue that has gained new relevance amid a wave of A.I. developments, with researchers believing the speech and technology puzzle can help make A.I.-powered devices, bots and speech synthesizers more conversational — that is, capable of pulling off a multitude of regional accents."
2023-07-02,"In Word Through The Times, we trace how one word or phrase has changed throughout the history of the newspaper.
On Page 8 of a Saturday issue of The New York Times in 1931 appeared the headline “‘Old West’ Returns in Nevada Gambling.” It announced a historical moment for the state, which, at the time, was the only one with legal casino gambling. “The hum and hubbub of gambling, the click-clack of machines and the clatter of poker chips were partly drowned by the staccato noise of a compressed air drill operated by a construction crew engaged in cutting through massive walls to enlarge the gaming room,” the article read.
The term “gaming” originally referred to “the act or practice of gambling,” according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. Nevada legalized gambling to bring in revenue after the Great Depression. Once word spread, the introduction of open gambling received mixed reviews. In 1934, The Times ran excerpts from sermons from two churches in New York City in which the pastors denounced lotteries. One said gambling was a “leprous touch on sport.” He continued, “It is anti-social. It breaks down character and corrupts public life.” Below the article’s headline, The Times referred to gambling as “public gaming.”
In the late 1970s, the term “gaming” became more closely associated with electronic gaming, thanks to a rise in coin-operated arcade games and video games. In 1981, The Times published a Style article titled “The Videogames: How They Rate,” compiled by Bill Kunkel, the executive editor of Electronic Games, the world’s first video game magazine, and Arnie Katz, the magazine’s co-publisher. The two ranked games and systems in “America’s fastest-growing hobby.” The game Space Invaders, they wrote, “in its original coin-operated form, helped inspire today’s electronic gaming boom.”
The use of “gaming” in The Times spiked in the early 2000s. In the column The Gamer, Seth Schiesel covered video game culture. In 2006, he wrote that he had attended the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas “to speak on a panel about next-generation gaming and to see if Sony would say anything substantive about the PlayStation 3.”

To many users, Twitter had become like a bad boyfriend.
Under Elon Musk, the platform could be unreliable and unfiltered. Some users called it toxic. They encouraged their followers to get off the platform in protest of Musk’s leadership, including his algorithm changes and decision to reinstate Donald Trump’s account. Other tech companies, like Substack, tried to offer frustrated Twitter users a new place to go, but none was compelling enough to pose a viable alternative — until now.
This week, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, released Threads, its Twitter competitor. It soon became the most rapidly downloaded app ever. More than 70 million users have joined Threads in the last few days, blowing past the audience sizes of Twitter’s other challengers.
Why? Because Meta had something that the other competitors didn’t: two billion existing users whom the company could push to use the new product. People log in to Threads using their Instagram account, rather than having to create a new user name, password and profile photo. Meta has also used its existing platforms to promote Threads.
For people who liked Twitter but didn’t like the changes that Musk put in place, or had grown tired of his antics, the emergence of Threads is exciting. For all its downsides, Twitter did play an important role in many people’s lives, helping them understand the news and stay current on trends in culture.
At the same time, the early success of Threads highlights a recurring problem in the internet economy. A tiny number of gargantuan companies have ever more control over our attention. Twitter, if anything, was too small to be considered part of this club. Meta, by contrast, is a modern behemoth, along with Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.
“They’re not only the wealthiest corporations that have ever existed, but they’ve institutionalized a new form of profound inequality” in who controls information, Shoshana Zuboff, a privacy expert at Harvard, said. “Threads is simply another property in a global surveillance empire.”"
2023-07-10,"How much is a dollar worth?
To Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, quite a lot.
Mr. Burgum is one of several Republican presidential candidates going to great lengths to reach a crucial threshold to qualify for the party’s first primary debate on Aug. 23 — the requirement that only candidates with at least 40,000 individual donors to their campaigns will be allowed on the stage.
A long-shot contender at the bottom of recent polls, Mr. Burgum is offering $20 gift cards to the first 50,000 people who donate at least $1 to his campaign. And one lucky donor, as his campaign advertised on Facebook, will have the chance to win a Yeti Tundra 45 cooler that typically costs more than $300 — just for donating at least $1. The unusual offer was earlier reported by FWIW, a newsletter that tracks digital politics.
Mr. Burgum’s push to prioritize donors over actual dollars is a sign of some candidates’ desperation to make the debate stage and to seize some of the national spotlight from the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, and his top rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another Republican candidate, recently ended a campaign ad with a direct plea that flashed on the screen to “Donate today, get Chris Christie on the debate stage.”
Mr. Burgum’s campaign acknowledged that its requests were directly tied to the debate and spun the gift-card giveaways into attacks on President Biden.
“Doug knows people are hurting because of Bidenflation, and giving Biden Economic Relief Gift Cards is a way to help 50,000 people until Doug is elected President to fix this crazy economy for everyone,” said Lance Trover, a spokesman for the Burgum campaign.

EZRA KLEIN: From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.”
So I think you can date this era in artificial intelligence back to the launch of ChatGPT, and what is weird, if you talk to artificial intelligence people about that, is they’ll tell you ChatGPT, it was just a wrapper, an interface system. The underlying system, GPT-3, had been around for a while. I’d had access to GPT-3 for quite a while before ChatGPT came around.
What ChatGPT did was it allowed you to talk to GPT-3 like you were a human and it was a human, so it made A.I. more human. It made it more able to communicate back and forth with us by doing a better job mimicking us and understanding us, which is amazing. I don’t mean to take anything away from it. But it created this huge land rush for A.I.s that functionally mimic human beings, A.I.s that relate as if they are human beings, that try to fool us into thinking that they’re human.
But I’ve always been more interested in more inhuman A.I. systems. When you ask somebody who’s working on artificial intelligence, including people who believe it could do terrible harm to the world, why are you doing it, what’s the point of this, they don’t say, oh, we should risk these terrible consequences because it’s fun to chat with ChatGPT. They say, oh, it’s going to solve all these terrible scientific problems we have, clean energy, and drug discovery, and it’s going to create an era of innovation like nothing humanity has ever experienced.

2023-07-12,"Chinese hackers penetrated the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other State and Commerce Department officials in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken traveled to Beijing in June, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
The investigation of the efforts by the Chinese hackers, who likely are affiliated with China’s military or spy services, is ongoing, American officials said. But U.S. officials have downplayed the idea that the hackers stole sensitive information, insisting that no classified email or cloud systems were penetrated. The State Department’s cybersecurity team first discovered the intrusion.
Ms. Raimondo, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Beijing in the administration, was among the targets, according to two U.S. officials. She has tightened export controls on China and threatened to cut off the country’s supply of U.S. semiconductor technology if it provides the chips to Russia. Ms. Raimondo is expected to visit China by the end of the summer.
Based on their preliminary investigation, officials believe she was the only cabinet-level official to be successfully hacked. The hackers were not able to acquire emails in Mr. Blinken’s Microsoft 365 account, even as they got access to other State Department email boxes, officials said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Multiple officials said the attack was aimed at individual email accounts, rather than a large-scale exfiltration of data, which Chinese hackers are suspected of having done before. Biden administration officials declined to give a full accounting of which officials had been targeted by the hackers.
Microsoft, which disclosed the hack on Tuesday, said it had begun in May, according to the company’s investigation. The State Department discovered the intrusion on June 16 and informed Microsoft that day, just ahead of Mr. Blinken’s trip to Beijing, a U.S. official said. He departed from Washington that evening.
The trip was critical for both Washington and Beijing: It was the first visit to China by a U.S. secretary of state in five years and was aimed at establishing high-level channels of communication and improving deteriorating relations. Since then, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen has visited Beijing, and John Kerry, the special envoy for climate, plans to land there on Sunday for four days of talks.
President Biden and Xi Jinping, China’s leader, agreed in a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, last November to try to stabilize relations, but tensions between the two nations ramped up when the Pentagon discovered and shot down a Chinese spy balloon that was floating over the continental United States in early February. Mr. Blinken canceled a trip to China during that episode; a few weeks later, he publicly accused Beijing of considering sending military aid to Russia for use in Ukraine.
One senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive incident, said the hack did not initially appear to be directly related to Mr. Blinken’s rescheduled trip. Other officials cautioned that the investigation into what material, if any, had been stolen by the hackers was still in the early stages.

In a statement on Wednesday, the State Department said that after detecting “anomalous activity,” the government took steps to secure the systems and “will continue to closely monitor and quickly respond to any further activity.”
The Commerce Department, according to a spokesman, learned its cloud-based email had been penetrated when it was informed by Microsoft, which had begun looking for other compromises after the State Department alerted the company of its breach. Commerce has been leading efforts to impose export controls to prevent the Chinese military from gaining access to critical American technology, a drive that has been a prime irritant to Beijing.
After the State Department reported the hack to Microsoft, the company found that the hackers had also targeted some 25 organizations, including government agencies. An official from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said some of those organizations were based overseas and the number of U.S.-based organizations affected was in the single digits.
U.S. officials said the hackers were targeting only a few email accounts in each organization, rather than carrying out a broad-brush intrusion. But neither U.S. officials nor Microsoft would say precisely how many accounts they believe might have been compromised by the Chinese hackers.
The U.S. government has not formally attributed the attack to China, perhaps because the Biden administration is trying to keep talks with Beijing on track. But privately, U.S. officials said they agreed with Microsoft’s attribution of the hack to China and said it had the markings of a sophisticated, government-backed attack.

American officials described the intrusions as surgical, in contrast to the SolarWinds hack in 2019 and 2020, in which Russian intelligence used a vulnerability in software supply chains to gain access to thousands of computer networks.
Spy agencies typically use intrusions in adversarial networks judiciously to try to extract as much information as possible without being detected.
The United States and China are locked in an intensifying intelligence competition, with both governments trying to expand their collection on the other. U.S. officials said that while such espionage and hacking is to be expected, they are conducting a robust investigation to close both the vulnerability the Chinese hackers used against the State Department as well as other potential security weaknesses in cloud computing.
On Wednesday, American officials said that the State Department’s cybersecurity experts had detected the intrusion by scrutinizing email access logs — a record of what emails were hacked and when.
Microsoft, American officials said, charges organizations extra for regular access to those logs. Some of the entities affected by the hack did not have that access, meaning that without Microsoft’s help they could not detect the intrusion. U.S. officials have been pushing for Microsoft to provide the access logs to all organizations that have a cloud computing contract with them.
The State Department is a frequent target of foreign government hacking. Russian intelligence has taken repeated aim at State Department computer networks. In 2014 and 2015, Russian hackers breached the State Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the White House and other critical, but unclassified, computer networks."
2023-07-13,"Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, faced more than three hours of criticism and ridicule from Republicans in a House hearing on Thursday, as emboldened critics increasingly put pressure on the agency for its crackdown on the growing power of tech giants.
During the highly partisan hearing, Republicans accused Ms. Khan, who has carried out an aggressive agenda of lawsuits and investigations against tech companies, of “harassing” businesses. The lawmakers, who repeatedly cut off Ms. Khan midsentence, also ridiculed her for the F.T.C.’s recent losses in antitrust cases and for wasting government resources.
“You are now 0 for 4 in merger trials,” Representative Kevin Kiley, Republican of California, said at the House Judiciary Committee hearing. “Why are you losing so much?”
The blistering session capped a bruising week that has brought greater scrutiny to the F.T.C. It was Ms. Khan’s first public appearance since a judge ruled on Tuesday against the agency’s attempt to stop Microsoft’s $70 billion acquisition of Activision. It was a major defeat in a tech case for the F.T.C. after another judge decided in May against its attempt to block Meta’s acquisition of a virtual reality app maker, Within.

Ms. Khan, a legal scholar, has become a lightning rod for her efforts to rein in corporate power and to give the F.T.C. more teeth in enforcement. Since President Biden picked her to lead the agency two years ago, she has said the F.T.C. was too complacent and needed to pursue more lawsuits against companies, even if it did not always win. Even in court losses, she has said, the cases expose the need to update antitrust laws for the digital age.
Ms. Khan’s aggressive agenda, which has spanned industries beyond tech, has rattled the agency, where two Republican commissioners and several senior officials have resigned. Christine Wilson, one of the former Republican members, accused Ms. Khan of abusing her power as chair. This month, Mr. Biden nominated the solicitor general for Virginia, Andrew Ferguson, and for Utah, Melissa Holyoak, to fill the Republican seats.
In Thursday’s hearing, Ms. Khan, 34, appeared unruffled. She highlighted the F.T.C.’s challenges to mergers in pharmaceutical, semiconductor, defense and energy markets. Many of those challenges did not go to court.
She said she didn’t bring cases that she thought would lose but, without referring to the Microsoft case, acknowledged the risks of her strategy.
“We fight hard when we believe there was a law violation, and unfortunately things don’t always go our way,” Ms. Khan said.

The losses have not weakened her focus on the tech industry. On Thursday, the F.T.C. filed to appeal the court decision on Microsoft’s deal with Activision. Also this week, it opened an investigation into the artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot, for potentially harming consumers with privacy and security lapses and for spreading false information about individuals.
Ms. Khan’s strategy may take years to pay off, said Megan Gray, a lawyer and a former member of the F.T.C.’s staff. “She knows that this is a long-term effort and this not a Pollyanna new antitrust push,” Ms. Gray said.
The White House reiterated its support for Ms. Khan on Thursday. “Chair Khan has delivered results for families, consumers, workers, small businesses and entrepreneurs,” Michael Kikukawa, a White House assistant press secretary, said in a statement.
At the hearing, the court loss this week provided more ammunition for Republicans in their complaints against the F.T.C.
Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, criticized Ms. Khan’s judgment in pursuing the case to block Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision. Regulators rarely bring cases against so-called vertical mergers of two companies that don’t directly compete. That was the case with Microsoft, a console maker, and Activision, a video game maker. And Sony, Microsoft’s competitor, has a big market share, Mr. Issa said.

He also criticized the F.T.C. for pursuing a case to block the pharmaceutical giant Illumina from merging with Grail, a cancer test maker, after a judge in the agency’s internal court disagreed with its fight to prevent the deal.
“My problem here today is that you’re a bully,” Mr. Issa said. “The reality is we are a global market, and you are thinking only of who you want to go after for some reason. And I cannot find your logic.”
Representative Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee, accused the agency of “harassing” Twitter in its investigation of the company’s security practices. Mr. Jordan, who has accused Democrats of censoring Republican views, has praised Twitter’s owner, Elon Musk, for loosening restrictions on speech.
“My concern is the sustained attack on Twitter when the ownership there changed,” Mr. Jordan said.
Ms. Khan replied: “We at the F.T.C. have no view on who should or should not own a company. All we care about is that the company is following the law.”
Democrats came to Ms. Khan’s defense.
Representative Jerrold Nadler from New York, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said it was the F.T.C.’s job to investigate Twitter for violating a consent decree that it agreed to more than a decade ago after previous security violations.

“Unfortunately, I expect that today you will be the target of a barrage of personal attacks and wild accusations about the work of the F.T.C. under your leadership,” Mr. Nadler said."

Hollywood braces for a lengthy labor battle.

Trouble in Tinseltown
It’s happening: America’s $134 billion movie and TV industry has ground to a halt after the Hollywood actors’ union voted to strike, joining screenwriters and shutting down virtually all productions.
The move reflects the growing aggressiveness of the American labor movement, which has been battling against Starbucks, Amazon, UPS and others. Only in this case, the dispute involves one of the most visible industries around — and there’s no sign of a compromise in sight.
The actors’ union blasted studios for refusing to bend on key issues, including higher payouts from streaming titles and clear limits on the use of artificial intelligence. “How they plead poverty, that they’re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their C.E.O.s.,” Fran Drescher, the TV actor who now leads the SAG-AFTRA union, said yesterday. “It is disgusting. Shame on them!”
The studios argue that the unions’ demands are unrealistic, given the challenges the entertainment industry faces, from streaming to fallout from the pandemic. “This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption,” Bob Iger, Disney’s C.E.O., said on CNBC yesterday. (More on him later.)

Expect more such comments next week on media company earnings calls.
Tinseltown’s glitz quickly went dim. Because actors are now forbidden from promoting their films, the cast of Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” walked out in the middle of the movie’s London premiere. And campaigning for shows nominated for Emmy awards, which were just announced on Wednesday, was suspended.
That will have consequences for other Hollywood industries, including advertising and talent agencies, celebrity and trade publications and film festivals. “The celebrity factory has shut down,” Janice Min, the head of the entertainment publication The Ankler, told Vanity Fair. “If this goes on for a long time, you will feel it across the whole internet.”"
2023-07-15,"Surging demand for metals used in electric vehicle batteries has kicked off an international race to mine the deep seas. And there are no rules.
On Sunday, the International Seabed Authority missed an important deadline to establish a regulatory framework, which means that companies can now apply for licenses before rules are final. Representatives from the agency, which is made up of 167 member states and the European Union, have gathered in Jamaica for two weeks to debate what should happen next.
Canada, France, Germany and others want to pause deep-sea mining because of its largely unknown environmental consequences. But countries including China, Norway and Russia are pushing ahead on establishing a framework, arguing that it is less destructive than land mining.
Seabed exploitation ventures, meanwhile, are eager to get started.
“We’re preparing our application,” said Gerard Barron, the chief executive of the Metals Company, a Canadian business that has an agreement with the Pacific island country of Nauru to sponsor its deep-sea mining endeavors.

The company preferred that there were final rules before acting, Mr. Barron told DealBook, “but we reserve the right to move forward.”
Regulators are under pressure to act. A United Nations convention establishes waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a territorial coast as communal property, which means that profits from minerals discovered there should be shared to some extent. The I.S.A. is responsible for setting up the structure for profit-sharing and taxing of mining efforts, as well as the legal and ecological guidelines. Or it could ban large-scale commercial mining altogether — though it’s not clear there is a legal path for a pause.
Mining could damage ecosystems that scientists don’t yet understand, said Jessica Battle, an ocean policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund. A study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, for example, argued that seabed mining could interfere with tuna migration patterns as climate change drives fish into new waters. Ms. Battle has been leading an effort to have businesses pledge not to finance seabed mining or source seafloor materials in their supply chains. More than 30 companies, including BMW, Google, Samsung, Volvo and Volkswagen, have signed on. Similarly, prominent banks in Britain, such as Lloyds and Standard Chartered, are refusing to do business with deep-sea mining entities. And seafood industry groups have demanded a moratorium.
Some also doubt the economic opportunity. Electric vehicles are expected to make up about 35 percent of cars sold globally by 2030, up from 14 percent in 2022, according to projections from the International Energy Agency. That growth will increase demand for metals like cobalt, copper and nickel that are used in batteries. But critics say that the expense and logistics of mining in the remote ocean — and transporting metals back to land — raise doubts about whether deep-sea mining can be profitable. Ms. Battle argued other solutions in the works — like alternative materials and programs for reusing and recycling batteries — could sufficiently satisfy demand for critical metals. “This industry could start without being needed,” she said of deep-sea mining.
But seabed mining supporters say that existing mining is worse for the environment, and deep-sea mining could help wrestle control of critical metals from China and Russia. Some also see it as an economic lifeline for small island nations that are suffering the worst effects of climate change.

“Do not tell me to ignore the potential for promoting the green transition by not exploring these much-needed minerals for the green revolution that sit in my ocean,” Mark Brown, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said at a U.N. climate conference last year. He referred to claims of environmental concern from countries that destroyed the planet “through decades of profit-driven development” as “patronizing.”
Mr. Barron of the Metals Company, who was in Jamaica for the I.S.A. meetings this week, pointed out that even some of the countries calling for a moratorium have exploration licenses, which allow them to experiment with mining on a small scale for research purposes. He believes representatives are deciding not whether deep-sea mining can begin, but when. “That horse has bolted,” he said. — Ephrat Livni
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Lina Khan’s bumpy week. The head of the F.T.C. lost a bid to block Microsoft’s $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, opened the first big investigation into OpenAI over ChatGPT’s privacy and security practices, and was grilled by a Republican-led congressional committee over her approach at the agency. The F.T.C. lost its appeal of the Microsoft ruling.
Hollywood shut down. Actors voted to go on strike for the first time in 43 years, joining screenwriters who had already taken industrial action. Unions say they want better wages, higher fees from streaming services and protections to deal with new technological threats, such as artificial intelligence. Studio bosses say the demands are unrealistic at a time when the entire industry is being disrupted.

A Senate hearing into a potential deal between the rival golf competitions revealed new details about the talks: the agreement was announced before it was done; the PGA Tour didn’t have the resources to fight off the Saudi-backed LIV indefinitely; and governance is going to be a crucial part of any final deal.

Tech stock dominance, by the numbers
The great tech stock rally shows no signs of slowing, with the Nasdaq composite hitting a 15-month high this week. One reason: Wall Street is betting that an improving inflation outlook, underscored by Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index, will compel the Federal Reserve to pivot to a more dovish rates policy, which tends to lift tech stocks.
How big has Big Tech gotten? Bank of America researchers ran the numbers this week. Here are three takeaways:
The stock gains this year have been especially concentrated among seven firms: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta.
The combined market capitalization of the so-called magnificent seven is roughly $11 trillion, a figure that exceeds the G.D.P. of every country but the United States and China.
This group has seen its combined market cap grow by $4 trillion this year.
The companies are cash rich. Six of the seven (all but Amazon) have a combined $200 billion net cash-to-debt balance.
What to watch: Big institutional investors have bought in on these stocks, which could sustain the rally in the short run. And the interest-rate risk for these companies is waning. But the bigger they grow, the more attention they could get from politicians.
The “political campaign rhetoric will likely include headline risk around regulation of megacap Tech,” Savita Subramanian, Bank of America’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, writes in the report.

Paris takes on ‘auto-besity’
Health authorities have waged a war on obesity for years. Now, in an effort to curtail the rise of big cars such as S.U.V.s and cut down on pollution, Paris has declared a war on “auto-besity.” Its first step is to charge drivers more to park the  vehicles — a move that could eventually hit car companies.
S.U.V. use has surged more than 60 percent in Paris over the past four years, according to city officials. That mirrors a broader trend across the European Union, with S.U.V.s accounting for about half of all car sales in the bloc, up from about 14 percent in 2011, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, an auto industry group.
Critics say that is bad for the planet. “We would like the City of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles,” Frédéric Badina-Serpette, the city councilor behind the increased charges, told The Guardian. He added that the aim was “to focus on an absurdity: auto-besity … the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities.”
The new rules will add to carmakers’ worries. Details haven’t been revealed, but electric vehicles and big families that require bigger vehicles are expected to be exempt. The higher tariffs will go into effect on Jan. 1, and could inspire similar moves in other big cities.

“France has traditionally been one of the most aggressive nations in combating the growth of large cars,” Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst, told DealBook. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, was already pressuring the French government to do more to support the industry, which is starting to feel the effect of Tesla’s price cuts and facing the growing threat of Chinese carmakers set to enter Europe. French brands, Mr. Schmidt added, are “in the middle of an uncomfortable sandwich, pressed from above and below.”

“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” the latest installment in Tom Cruise’s efforts to transcend physics for the sake of entertainment, is forecast to earn $90 million in its first five days, a franchise record. (Mild spoilers ahead.)
But the movie also represents how the hype around artificial intelligence is seeping into pop culture: The big bad guy in the movie is the Entity, a rogue artificial intelligence program that poses a threat to humanity.

Over decades, humans’ relationship with artificial intelligence has been explored by movies like “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Ex Machina” and, yes, “A.I.” But the public debut of ChatGPT last year, which gave many people their first chance to converse with an A.I., has made visions of sentient technology feel less like science fiction and, for some, stirred up existential dread.
Remember how over 350 A.I. experts called in May for “mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I.”? The Entity is capable of “collapsing the world’s economic systems, evading national-security protocols and rerouting nuclear weapons on a whim.” At least in the movies, a nearly superhuman secret agent can beat back killer technology. (We presume; this is a Cruise movie, after all.) In real life, it may take coordination by lawmakers worldwide — and time will tell if that mission is … well, you know.

China’s post-pandemic recovery is struggling to gain momentum.

China’s high-quality growth challenge
When China finally lifted Covid restrictions last year, policymakers and companies hoped that it would help lift the global economy out of its post-pandemic doldrums. But data released on Monday shows that the hoped-for recovery in the world’s second-biggest economy still hasn’t materialized, raising wider questions about global growth, the implications for international business and China’s dealings with the outside world.
Gross domestic product grew just 0.8 percent in the second quarter compared to the first three months of the year, according to official statistics, as falling exports, weak consumer spending and a stalled property sector hammered the economy.
The disappointing data hit commodities and stocks this morning, with Brent crude tumbling to a one-week low and shares in the China-dependent luxury groups LVMH and Richemont opening sharply lower. Shortly after, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup cut their full-year growth forecasts for China.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Bloomberg that China’s slowdown could have a “negative” impact for other economies, including the United States.
The real story is found beyond the headline numbers. Monday’s data reveals that trade last month had its worst year-on-year decline since the start of the pandemic, partly because Western consumers cut back on buying as central banks raised rates. That added to pressures on manufacturers as companies look to shift their supply chains away from China amid geopolitical tensions and talk of “de-risking.”

“If China can’t change its development model, it will not alter the drags on the economy or on living standards,” George Magnus, an associate at Oxford University’s China Center and a former chief economist at UBS, told DealBook. “The focus has shifted to growth quality rather than quantity, but here too Xi Jinping’s China comes up very short.”
Will this make China more willing to engage with the West? Beijing is sending mixed messages. Senior officials have embarked on a charm offensive aimed at international business leaders in recent months. But last week, Chinese state media slammed Goldman Sachs after the Wall Street firm recommended selling shares in local banks because of their exposure to risks in the domestic economy.
What next? Group of 20 central bankers and finance ministers are meeting this week in India, with this data adding to their worries about the state of the global economy. Some pessimists say the Chinese economy has peaked and a significant slowdown is coming. Chinese policymakers, however, often point out that it took about a year after Covid for the West’s recovery to start to kick in, so there is still a chance things could turn around this year, Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, told DealBook.
But, Mr. Pettis added, international investors need to look at China differently than they once did. “When China was growing at double-digit rates, even poor parts of the economy were growing,” he said. “Now, that China story is over and it looks like a more normal economy. Some sectors will do well, some will do horribly.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Russia withdraws from a Ukraine grain export deal. The move by Moscow to suspend participation in the agreement, which allows Ukrainian wheat to flow out of the country despite wartime blockades, could again roil global food prices. Russia has complained that the deal, which had been set to expire on Monday, was too favorable to Kyiv.

Microsoft agrees to a truce with Sony over its takeover of Activision Blizzard. Microsoft agreed to keep Call of Duty available on Sony’s PlayStation for 10 years after the U.S. company closes its $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, resolving one of the biggest disputes over the deal. It’s the latest victory for Microsoft, after a federal judge last week refused to further delay its ability to complete the transaction.
United Airlines reaches a $10 billion accord with its pilots. The four-year agreement calls for pay raises for pilots of up to 40.2 percent over the duration of the contract, as well as improvements to work rules, job security and more. It’s the richest-ever labor pact at an American airline.
The Teamsters’ chief asks President Biden not to intervene in the UPS labor talks. Sean O’Brien, the union’s leader, said that he had asked the White House to stay out of its battle with the logistics giant after talks collapsed this month. The existing contract expires on July 31; sticking points include proposed wage increases for part-time drivers.

Political donors’ 2024 dilemma
As the presidential race heats up, many deep-pocketed Democratic backers have groused about a lack of enthusiasm for President Biden. But the Biden campaign announced recently that it had raised over $72 million in the second quarter — far surpassing what Donald Trump and other Republican candidates have collected.
Democratic officials pointed to the news as a sign that the party’s donor class was on board. But some in politics are wondering if Mr. Biden did so well only because no obvious winning alternative to Trump has yet to emerge.
Mr. Biden had plenty of support from major donors. Ten gave $500,000 or more to the Biden Victory Fund, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul and co-chair of his re-election campaign; Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder; and Stewart Bainum, a hotel magnate. Other major benefactors included the Twilio co-founder John Wolthuis ($300,000) and the OpenAI chief Sam Altman ($200,000).

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
There are some reasons for Mr. Biden to be concerned. Small donors — considered crucial for a campaign’s success, since bigger ones can hit giving limits fairly quickly — have lagged in their giving. And Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who has clashed with Biden over climate policy, heads to New Hampshire on Monday for a town hall organized by No Labels, a group exploring a third-party presidential nominee.
Also, DealBook still hears concerns from deep-pocketed potential donors about Biden’s age and grumbling about his administration’s occasional cold shoulder to Wall Street, which was slow to back him in 2020, too.

(Though financiers have groused about parts of Mr. Biden’s economic approach, including his embrace of tougher antitrust enforcement, they may be heartened by receding inflation and the reduced likelihood of a recession.)
Compare that with the Republican field:
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has drawn support from heavyweight donors including the financier Paul Tudor Jones, the industrialist Dick Uihlein and the venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.
Other Republican hopefuls who have their own big backers include Vivek Ramaswamy (Bill Ackman, Glenn Dubin and Ed Hyman of Evercore ISI), Nikki Haley (Cliff Asness and Tim Draper), Chris Christie (Lew Eisenberg) and Senator Tim Scott (Larry Ellison).
But apart from Mr. DeSantis, who raised $20 million during the quarter, none came close to the $35 million that Mr. Trump raised during that period; they also badly trail him in public polls. Mr. DeSantis faces other issues: His campaign has moved to shed staff amid heavy spending, and many of its donors have already maxed out what they can give.
It isn’t clear where else donors would go. Rupert Murdoch has privately told associates that he wished Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia would run, though Mr. Youngkin’s support for tight restrictions on abortion may hurt his appeal among some big donors.
And while some moguls have flocked to Robert Kennedy Jr., who is challenging Mr. Biden for the Democratic nomination, his divisive views on vaccines and the coronavirus — most recently expressed in a bigoted conspiracy-laden rant — may make him political kryptonite.

The growing costs of extreme weather
This summer’s weather is shaping up to be especially dramatic, and sometimes deadly, as record-setting temperatures and violent storms rack much of the planet. That could have dire consequences for people’s lives and livelihoods alike.
July has already set a global record for the hottest days ever, with no relief in sight. New highs may be reached at multiple points around the globe, from California to Phoenix to southern Europe and beyond. Much of this is being blamed on the return of the El Niño weather phenomenon.
It isn’t just excessive heat. A severe typhoon warning forced Hong Kong’s stock exchange operator to halt trading this morning. Torrential rains devastated the northeastern United States again this weekend, as flash flooding outside Philadelphia killed five, and flight cancellations, power outages and submerged roadways forced New Jersey to declare a state of emergency.
Economists are warning about the weather, given that it is hitting small businesses hard. In tourism-dependent Italy, the country’s health minister, Orazio Schillaci, cautioned Italians to stay indoors during the hottest hours of the day, and warned tourists to avoid visiting hot spots like Rome’s Colosseum.

“A common theme across El Niño events are more inflationary pressures as a result of higher commodity prices,” Henry Allen, a strategist for Deutsche Bank, wrote in an investor note last month. Soaring food prices could make central bankers’ battle against inflation even tougher.
In other climate news: Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, warned that efforts to fight climate change, including through greater use of solar and wind power, shouldn’t lead to what he called “the global decline of biodiversity.”
The week ahead
Fed officials are in a quiet period ahead of next week’s big rate-setting meeting, but there are plenty of other developments on the calendar. Here’s what to expect.
Tuesday: Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab report earnings. Also, retail sales data for June is set for release.
Wednesday: ASML, Goldman Sachs, Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines disclose results. Britain, which has been suffering from especially high inflation, releases price data for June.
Thursday: American Airlines, Johnson & Johnson and Truist Financial, one of the regional lenders hit by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, are set to report earnings.

Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief, has pledged commitment to E.S.G. but said he no longer used that term.

Winnie Au for The New York Times
A BlackRock U-turn?
BlackRock made a name for itself, and many conservative enemies, in recent years by publicly embracing environmental, social and corporate governance considerations — known as E.S.G. — in its decisions, and arguing that other companies should do the same.
So the investment giant’s decision on Monday to name Amin Nasser, the C.E.O. of Saudi Arabia’s oil company Aramco, to its board feels like a major reversal, despite its claims that the move doesn’t contradict its E.S.G. commitments.
Nasser leads the world’s biggest oil producer, with Aramco having produced 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day last year. He will succeed Bader Alsaad, the director general of the Arab Fund for Economic & Social Development, on BlackRock’s board.
Is the appointment a U-turn for BlackRock on climate? Larry Fink, the firm’s C.E.O., has spent years saying that E.S.G. principles were crucial business considerations. That approach has come under fire from conservative politicians who have attacked BlackRock for its commitment to what they called “woke” policies, and several officials in red states have withdrawn billions of their assets from its coffers in retribution.

Mr. Fink said last month that he had stopped using E.S.G., calling it a “weaponized” term, but he added that the firm was continuing to push companies to take steps to decarbonize. And in announcing Mr. Nasser’s appointment, BlackRock emphasized his “understanding of the global energy industry and the drivers of the shift towards a low carbon economy.”
But Mr. Nasser has criticized decarbonization efforts. While the kingdom has announced several clean energy initiatives, including a $1.5 billion energy-transition fund, Mr. Nasser has questioned current efforts to reach a lower-carbon future.
“The current transition plan is flawed honestly,” he said last year. “It is not really delivering. What we need is an optimal, realistic transition plan.”
Mr. Nasser also solidifies BlackRock’s ties to Saudi Arabia at a time of heightened controversy over the kingdom’s record on human rights. The PGA Tour’s tentative deal involving LIV Golf, the Saudi-backed rival competition, has renewed scrutiny of the country as it pours money into Western businesses.

Mr. Fink backed out of the kingdom’s Future Investment Initiative conference in 2018 after the murder of the Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but he returned the next year and has since defended doing business with the country.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Extreme heat is bearing down on the Northern Hemisphere. Parts of Europe and the southern United States are expected to experience record-breaking highs, with consequences for human health and economic activity. As China faces sweltering heat, John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, met with the country’s premier to urge cooperation in fighting climate change.
Microsoft and Activision reportedly plan to extend a deadline for their deal. Microsoft’s $70 billion takeover of the video game maker isn’t poised to close on Tuesday as expected, as the two negotiate a settlement with Britain’s antitrust regulator, according to Bloomberg. The Competition and Markets Authority, which had previously moved to block the transaction, has set an Aug. 29 deadline for the talks.
Senator Elizabeth Warren urges the S.E.C. to investigate Tesla. The Massachusetts Democrat called on the agency to examine potential “conflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets” and more, citing reports about Elon Musk bringing over Tesla employees to work at Twitter after he bought the social network. She suggested that the move may have violated employment laws and wasn’t properly disclosed to investors.
U.S. companies win some relief from a global tax deal. Under new rules negotiated by the Treasury Department, American businesses now have until 2026 before other countries can start imposing new levies on corporations deemed to have paid too little in the United States. The revised agreement offers more certainty for companies, but the Biden administration is still struggling to conform to the pact to avoid losing out on taxes.

A Labor Day milestone for the Hollywood strike
As screenwriters and actors — including celebrities like Jason Sudeikis and Kevin Bacon — walked picket lines on Monday, media moguls are starting to sweat over the reality of a two-headed Hollywood strike.
Studios insist that they can ride out the work stoppage that has largely shut American movie and TV productions. But there’s growing fear that if it stretches beyond a little more than a month, their business could suffer badly.
A countdown to Labor Day looms. Three studio chairs told The Times that Hollywood could sit idle until early September with no major long-term business damage. TV studios are continuing to introduce contingency plans for the fall: CBS became the latest on Monday, announcing a lineup composed of reruns of “Yellowstone” and reality and game shows.
But a strike that goes on longer would most likely mean big delays for projects set for next year, threatening to make 2024 a ghost town for content. And TV giants can survive on lineups built largely on the likes of “Survivor” and “The Golden Bachelor” for only so long.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The costs of a lengthy strike are becoming clearer. While media executives suggested that they could use the work stoppage to cut costs, including by ending some expensive production deals, those benefits will be short-lived. The media mogul Barry Diller recently outlined to “Face the Nation” the knock-on effects of an extended strike:
“You’re going to see subscriptions get pulled, which is going to reduce the revenue of all these movie companies, television companies, the result of which is that there will be no programs. And at just the time, strike is settled, that you want to get back up, there won’t be enough money. So this actually will have devastating effects, if it is not settled soon.”
And the analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson noted that American studios could suffer if platforms like Netflix turn to overseas content producers for new movies and shows. “It’s like if the United Auto Workers go on strike, and all of a sudden you see more cars from Japan and Germany on the road,” he told The Times.
Mr. Diller has already proposed a solution. “As a good-faith measure, both the executives and the most-paid actors should take a 25 percent pay cut to try and narrow the difference between those who get highly paid and those that don’t,” he told “Face the Nation.” On Monday, a group representing studios in the labor talks said that before the strike, its members had offered over $1 billion worth of concessions on pay and benefits, as well as limits on their use of artificial intelligence.

It’s unclear whether that would be enough, however, with all sides acknowledging that battle lines are hardened.
A Ripple effect for crypto enforcement
Crypto fans are celebrating after a federal judge last week gave the digital currency industry a partial win over the S.E.C.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Though the agency in 2020 had accused Ripple of failing to register its XRP token as a security, the judge ruled that XRP wasn’t a security in all contexts. It wasn’t a total victory, but Ripple and its allies are claiming it as a major accomplishment anyway.
The case was seen as a bellwether of crypto’s future in the United States amid the S.E.C.’s aggressive enforcement actions against the industry. Gary Gensler, the agency’s chair, has repeatedly argued that most digital tokens are securities, though crypto companies have protested that this approach was trying to regulate them out of existence instead of giving clearer rules.
What the judge ruled: When XRP was sold to institutional investors, the token was a security because investors relied on Ripple’s assertions that its value would rise. But when it traded on secondary exchanges, retail investors didn’t have those same expectations, so XRP wasn’t considered a security in that context.
Industry executives hope the ruling has set a helpful precedent. Coinbase, for instance, is betting that the decision augurs well for its fight against the S.E.C., which has accused it of selling unregistered securities.
But securities law experts aren’t celebrating. “The decision is at odds with what securities law is meant to do,” Hilary Allen, a professor at American University Washington College of Law, told DealBook, arguing that retail traders should get more protection than presumably more sophisticated institutional investors.

And Tyler Gellasch, a former S.E.C. lawyer who now leads the Healthy Markets Association, said that the ruling created a “massive loophole” for many companies, even outside crypto. “This decision is my real-life nightmare scenario,” he said.

Goldman prepares to face its naysayers
The big event for Wall Street earnings will come on Wednesday, when Goldman Sachs reports second-quarter results. Questions — and frustrations — are swirling about its slumping stock, its troubled foray into consumer banking, including its acquisition of the buy-now-pay-later firm GreenSky, and the future of its C.E.O., David Solomon.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Here’s what DealBook will be watching:
How big of a goodwill hit will Goldman take on GreenSky? The bank has announced that it is exploring a sale of the firm it purchased last year for $1.7 billion, as part of its retrenchment from Solomon’s big consumer push. But bids have come in well below expectations.
What’s the future of its Apple partnership? The bank is reportedly in talks to offload the business to American Express, despite Goldman’s public support for the alliance. “It’s a very, very strong part­ner­ship where there’s a lot of op­por­tu­nity,” Mr. Solomon said in October.
Are more layoffs planned? The bank has made job cuts this year, and there are reports it’s not done slashing costs. (The bank recently resumed its historical practice of letting go of underperformers.) Internally, there’s concern that Goldman will nominate significantly fewer bankers to its managing director class this year. As one banker told DealBook: “I don’t know if I’m getting promoted — or fired.”
What about profits? Investors will be focused on average return on equity. The goal is to hit 14 to 16 percent on this key measure of profitability. Reports suggest that it could come in far lower (Goldman itself has been publicly downplaying expectations in a break with tradition), further evidence that the bank is falling behind Wall Street heavyweights such as JPMorgan Chase.
Will Goldman say any more about the appointment of Tom Montag? The firm said last month that it had tapped the former Bank of America and Goldman executive to join its board.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Montag has a reputation for strong risk management. But his appointment created a stir inside Goldman and beyond, given Mr. Solomon’s efforts to move the bank away from an old boys’ club reputation.
Will Solomon address his future? He appears to want the naysayers to know that Goldman’s board is well and truly behind him. But Wednesday brings a big test, with many Wall Street watchers expecting the bank to deliver a dud — a scenario that Goldman itself has been leaking in recent weeks to lower expectations.

2023-07-20,"The hack of Microsoft’s cloud that resulted in the compromise of government emails was an example of a traditional espionage threat, a senior National Security Agency official said.
Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Rob Joyce, the director of cybersecurity at the N.S.A., said the United States needed to protect its networks from such espionage, but that adversaries would continue to try to secretly extract information from each other.
“It is China doing espionage,” Mr. Joyce said. “It is what nation-states do. We have to defend against it, we need to push back against it. But that is something that happens.”
The hackers took emails from senior State Department officials including Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China. The theft of Mr. Burns’s emails was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by a person familiar with the matter. Daniel J. Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia, also had his email hacked, a U.S. official said.

The emails of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo were also obtained in the hack, which was discovered in June by State Department cybersecurity experts scouring user logs for unusual activity. Microsoft later determined that Chinese hackers had obtained access to email accounts a month earlier.
In a new deal with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency announced on Wednesday, Microsoft agreed to provide access to cloud computing logs to more users so they could hunt for unusual activity or potential hacks.
Hundreds of thousands of emails were compromised, but U.S. officials have described the attack as a targeted one that used a compromised security key to penetrate selected Microsoft Outlook mailboxes.
Mr. Joyce said the attackers were able to impersonate authorization to read those emails.
Speaking alongside Mr. Joyce, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said the attack showed the “growing sophistication” of China.
But both Mr. Joyce and Mr. Smith said the hack announced last week was less concerning than a broader breach that Microsoft, the N.S.A. and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency announced in May. In that intrusion, which affected networks in Guam and elsewhere, malware was placed inside critical infrastructure and some unclassified military systems. Such cyberweapons could be used if tensions escalate between the United States and China over Taiwan.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In the hack announced last week, U.S. officials have said Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s emails were not compromised. In a statement last week, Mr. Blinken said the incident remains under investigation.
“As a general matter, we have consistently made clear to China as well as to other countries that any action that targets the U.S. government or U.S. companies, American citizens, is of deep concern to us, and we will take appropriate action in response,” Mr. Blinken said.

2023-07-21,"Regulating artificial intelligence has been a hot topic in Washington in recent months, with lawmakers holding hearings and news conferences and the White House announcing voluntary A.I. safety commitments by seven technology companies on Friday.
But a closer look at the activity raises questions about how meaningful the actions are in setting policies around the rapidly evolving technology.
The answer is that it is not very meaningful yet. The United States is only at the beginning of what is likely to be a long and difficult path toward the creation of A.I. rules, lawmakers and policy experts said. While there have been hearings, meetings with top tech executives at the White House and speeches to introduce A.I. bills, it is too soon to predict even the roughest sketches of regulations to protect consumers and contain the risks that the technology poses to jobs, the spread of disinformation and security.
“This is still early days, and no one knows what a law will look like yet,” said Chris Lewis, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge, which has called for the creation of an independent agency to regulate A.I. and other tech companies.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The United States remains far behind Europe, where lawmakers are preparing to enact an A.I. law this year that would put new restrictions on what are seen as the technology’s riskiest uses. In contrast, there remains a lot of disagreement in the United States on the best way to handle a technology that many American lawmakers are still trying to understand.
That suits many of the tech companies, policy experts said. While some of the companies have said they welcome rules around A.I., they have also argued against tough regulations akin to those being created in Europe.

Here’s a rundown on the state of A.I. regulations in the United States.
At the White House
The Biden administration has been on a fast-track listening tour with A.I. companies, academics and civil society groups. The effort began in May when Vice President Kamala Harris met at the White House with the chief executives of Microsoft, Google, OpenAI and Anthropic and pushed the tech industry to take safety more seriously.
On Friday, representatives of seven tech companies appeared at the White House to announce a set of principles for making their A.I. technologies safer, including third-party security checks and watermarking of A.I.-generated content to help stem the spread of misinformation.
Many of the practices that were announced had already been in place at OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, or were on track to take effect. They don’t represent new regulations. Promises of self-regulation also fell short of what consumer groups had hoped.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Voluntary commitments are not enough when it comes to Big Tech,” said Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy group. “Congress and federal regulators must put meaningful, enforceable guardrails in place to ensure the use of A.I. is fair, transparent and protects individuals’ privacy and civil rights.”
Last fall, the White House introduced a Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights, a set of guidelines on consumer protections with the technology. The guidelines also aren’t regulations and are not enforceable. This week, White House officials said they were working on an executive order on A.I., but didn’t reveal details and timing.
In Congress
The loudest drumbeat on regulating A.I. has come from lawmakers, some of whom have introduced bills on the technology. Their proposals include the creation of an agency to oversee A.I., liability for A.I. technologies that spread disinformation and the requirement of licensing for new A.I. tools.
Lawmakers have also held hearings about A.I., including a hearing in May with Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot. Some lawmakers have tossed around ideas for other regulations during the hearings, including nutritional labels to notify consumers of A.I. risks.
The bills are in their earliest stages and so far do not have the support needed to advance. Last month, The Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, announced a monthslong process for the creation of A.I. legislation that included educational sessions for members in the fall.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“In many ways we’re starting from scratch, but I believe Congress is up to the challenge,” he said during a speech at the time at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
At federal agencies
Regulatory agencies are beginning to take action by policing some issues emanating from A.I.
Last week, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into OpenAI’s ChatGPT and asked for information on how the company secures its systems and how the chatbot could potentially harm consumers through the creation of false information. The F.T.C. chair, Lina Khan, has said she believes the agency has ample power under consumer protection and competition laws to police problematic behavior by A.I. companies.
“Waiting for Congress to act is not ideal given the usual timeline of congressional action,” said Andres Sawicki, a professor of law at the University of Miami."
2023-07-22,"This week, the White House announced that it had secured “voluntary commitments” from seven leading A.I. companies to manage the risks posed by artificial intelligence.
Getting the companies — Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI — to agree to anything is a step forward. They include bitter rivals with subtle but important differences in the ways they’re approaching A.I. research and development.
Meta, for example, is so eager to get its A.I. models into developers’ hands that it has open-sourced many of them, putting their code out into the open for anyone to use. Other labs, such as Anthropic, have taken a more cautious approach, releasing their technology in more limited ways.
But what do these commitments actually mean? And are they likely to change much about how A.I. companies operate, given that they aren’t backed by the force of law?
Given the potential stakes of A.I. regulation, the details matter. So let’s take a closer look at what’s being agreed to here and size up the potential impact.
Commitment 1: The companies commit to internal and external security testing of their A.I. systems before their release.

Nasdaq futures are up on Tuesday morning, ahead of a Big Tech earnings bonanza that kicks off when Microsoft and Alphabet report second-quarter results after the closing bell. One question is at the top of many investors’ minds: Is the hype around artificial intelligence, which has propelled tech giants’ stock prices sky-high in recent months, justified, or is it another bubble in the making?
Wall Street is deeply divided about the A.I. rally. Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, apologized to clients on Monday, writing that his pessimistic stock market calls failed to spot the surge in A.I.-related stocks. (The chip maker Nvidia, for example, has seen its stock triple in value since January.) And analysts at Citigroup are sticking to their bullish thesis for such companies.
On the other hand, Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan Chase’s chief market strategist, is unconvinced that tech fervor will help the markets avoid a sharp decline this year.
All eyes will be on Microsoft and Alphabet, which are at the forefront of commercializing generative A.I., the technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT that have captured the public’s imagination. Both are incorporating A.I. into a wide array of their products, with Microsoft — which has invested billions in OpenAI — hoping that the technology can help it gain ground on Google in key businesses like search.

Meta’s turn is Wednesday. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is also betting big on the technology, including by making the code for its most advanced A.I. project free for public use. (Analysts also want to know more about how Meta plans to make money from Threads, its new rival to Twitter, the company rebranded as X.)
Macroeconomic factors are still weighing on these companies. Inflation and an uncertain outlook hit them hard last year, as customers cut back on buying software and spending on advertising, spurring them to lay off thousands of workers.
Recent data shows that inflation has begun to moderate, lifting these stocks in recent weeks, but investors will want to see proof that the sector is through the worst of it. The Fed is widely expected to increase interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its rate-setting meeting on Wednesday, but Wall Street isn’t sure whether the central bank will stop there or continue raising borrowing costs and risk a recession.
And it won’t just come down to tech stocks. This is the busiest week of the current earnings season, with 39 percent of S&P 500 firms announcing results. The next few days will provide an important look at the overall health of corporate America. Consumer bellwethers including Coca-Cola and McDonald’s and industrial titans like Boeing will be reporting.

Unilever says that inflation has peaked. Shares in the consumer goods giant rallied on Tuesday morning after it reported a strong second-half sales outlook, with the company forecasting that slowing price increases will translate to higher consumer purchases. But it warned that the war in Ukraine could send agricultural commodity prices higher, raising costs.

UBS agrees to $387 million in fines over Credit Suisse missteps. UBS reached a deal with U.S. and British regulators to resolve inquiries into the oversight failures that led to Credit Suisse losing $5.5 billion in the collapse of the investment firm Archegos in 2021. UBS bought its ailing rival this year, inheriting its thicket of legal troubles.

Crypto has major questions about the S.E.C.
Cryptocurrencies and climate change have been linked as issues before in terms of how carbon-intensive it is to produce new digital tokens. But the crypto industry is also hoping to piggyback off a legal doctrine at the heart of a Supreme Court decision involving the Environmental Protection Agency last year.
Coinbase is seizing on an E.P.A. loss as a legal defense. Last summer, the Supreme Court struck down an emissions rule by the environmental agency, citing the so-called major questions doctrine, a principle asserting that Congress hasn’t given regulators power to decide significant political or economic issues on their own.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Now, Coinbase is arguing that the S.E.C. can’t prosecute it because it lacks the power to regulate crypto. Moreover, the exchange says, Congress is actively working on legislation to oversee its industry. “It’s never been clearer that the Supreme Court has particular focus on major questions and the role of regulators in our economy,” Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, told DealBook.
The S.E.C. counters that Coinbase is missing the point. Agency lawyers wrote in a recent court filing that the E.P.A. case was about rule-making, not the regulator’s power to prosecute. Critics add that it’s not clear that regulating crypto counts as a major-question issue, given that the industry’s total market capitalization is less than that of Apple, Microsoft or Alphabet.

Business advocates appear undeterred by those arguments. “The major questions doctrine seems built for crypto at this moment,” Katie Haun, the crypto investor and former federal prosecutor, tweeted recently.
Separately, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents businesses more broadly, has expressed eagerness to use major-questions arguments in court to limit the power of a proposed Federal Trade Commission ban on noncompete clauses.

Has X’s debut hit its mark?
Though Elon Musk’s rebranding of Twitter as X came as a surprise over the weekend, the abrupt name change is playing about as well as could have been expected these days. Users and advertisers were divided on the wisdom of the move, which eliminated the company’s longtime bird logo, even if pulling down the old signage ran into some hiccups.
The change was reflected at Twitter’s headquarters immediately. Inside the San Francisco office, X logos were projected in the cafeteria, while conference rooms were renamed with words including “eXposure” and “s3Xy,” according to The Times.
But efforts to remove the Twitter name from the building encountered difficulties, when the San Francisco Police Department stopped workers for performing “unauthorized work.” As of this morning, the letters “er” remain visible from the street.
People can’t agree on whether the move will cost the company dearly. Skeptics said ditching the Twitter name and famous bird logo — which Twitter once identified as among its most recognizable assets — could cost as much as $20 billion in value. (Among them: Esther Crawford, the former Twitter executive who was briefly among Mr. Musk’s top lieutenants.) Some users bemoaned the switch to the more generic-sounding X.

Others said that the rebranding could help the company shed years of baggage associated with the Twitter name, a line of thought shared by none other than Jack Dorsey, the company’s co-founder. Some ad executives said that the change wouldn’t meaningfully drive away potential advertisers, while others said that Musk had at least succeeded in drumming up publicity for his platform after Meta’s Threads made a splashy debut.
Speaking of Meta … the Facebook parent company owns an X trademark with regards to social networking, though it relates to a specific blue-and-white logo. Mr. Musk’s company now uses a black-and-white mark, though trademark lawyers said the reliance on a simple letter almost certainly invited legal challenges.

Critics say Harvard’s legacy preferences policies disproportionately benefit white, wealthy applicants.

Kayana Szymczak for The New York Times
Legacy admissions in the cross hairs
In opening a civil rights investigation into Harvard’s legacy admissions policy — in which relatives of alumni and donors are given preference — the Biden administration inserted itself into a fierce debate amid efforts to remake the world of higher education.
Opponents of legacy admissions have argued that the policy is unfair, especially after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in higher education. But Harvard and other elite schools have defended the practice as a crucial means of raising money.
The Education Department acted on accusations by liberal groups. Legacy admissions policies, they say, tilt overwhelmingly toward white and wealthy students and discriminate against Black, Hispanic and Asian applicants.
Those claims were buttressed this week by a new study, which found that while legacy applicants were generally more qualified than the average applicant, they were accepted at much higher rates than competitors with similar qualifications. About half of legacy students at the elite colleges examined by the study wouldn’t be there without such an admissions boost.
Legacy admissions policies have been a lightning rod for criticism. Detractors from both parties — including President Biden and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina — have accused the practice of unfairly favoring the privileged.
In a concurring opinion to the affirmative action decision, Justice Neil Gorsuch criticized legacy policies for “undoubtedly” benefiting white and wealthy applicants. And even Edward Blum, the activist who spearheaded the anti-affirmative action case, has supported banning such preferences.

Will today’s inflation data come in above or below the Fed’s target?

Eva Marie Uzcategui for The New York Times
A big test for the economy
With the S&P 500 in bull-market territory, corporate profits coming in better than expected and surprisingly decent economic growth, the soft-landing optimists are feeling pretty good about the direction of the economy. But their position will be tested as soon as Friday morning.
At 8:30 a.m. Eastern, the Commerce Department will release the June figures for the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Economists expect to see a core P.C.E. reading — which strips out volatile purchases like food and energy — of 4.2 percent, down sharply from a year ago, but still well above the central bank’s target of 2 percent.
A hot P.C.E. number could determine the Fed’s next move on interest rates. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, reiterated on Wednesday that progress had been made in reducing inflation, but that it remained too high to rule out further increases in interest rates. That is top of mind for investors, who will be scrutinizing inflation and labor market data — the next jobs report comes out next Friday — to figure out what the Fed will do in September.
The concern is that the U.S. economy is still on uncertain footing, and that further tightening of borrowing costs could trigger a downturn. The Fed’s own economists no longer predict a recession, but some on Wall Street remain bearish about the second half of the year.

Economists worry that prices will be higher for longer. “We are cautiously optimistic of a quicker return to 2 percent” core P.C.E., Andrew Patterson, senior economist at Vanguard, wrote in a research note on Thursday. But he added that such a target was not likely to be reached before 2025.
Translation: Inflation could remain a wild card for the Fed well into next year.
Europe’s economy is looking even more vulnerable. As expected, the European Central Bank raised interest rates on Thursday by a quarter percentage point, as the eurozone grapples with inflation rates well above the United States’s.
Christine Lagarde, the E.C.B.’s president, suggested that the central bank could pause on raising rates in September, as data showed high prices sapping consumers of their buying power, putting the bloc’s economy at risk. Data this morning from Germany showing that Europe’s biggest economy is stagnating underscored this concern.
Meanwhile, in Japan … The Bank of Japan surprised global markets this morning by loosening its cap on 10-year government bond yields, the equivalent of an interest-rate increase.
Japanese stocks and bonds fell sharply, catching up with a drop in U.S. stock indexes on Thursday that was driven by forecasts that Japan’s central bank would signal an end to its yearslong policy of maintaining rock-bottom interest rates.

Regulators propose higher capital requirements for U.S. banks. Federal officials announced draft rules that could force lenders to hold 20 percent more in reserves to bolster their financial stability. The proposal could affect companies like American Express and Morgan Stanley that rely on fee income from wealth management, which would face more onerous capital requirements.

A return to luxury megadeals?
The fashion world took note on Thursday when Kering, the conglomerate that owns Gucci, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Saint Laurent, bought a 30 percent stake in Valentino at a $1.9 billion valuation.
The deal, which gives Kering the right to buy the rest of Valentino by 2028, signals the company’s return to big-ticket M.&A.
It’s a major strategic move by Kering, which has been eclipsed in recent years by its archrival LVMH, which through deals for Tiffany, Off White and others is now significantly bigger in both size and market cap.
Kering, which is controlled by the billionaire Pinault family, has also suffered from controversy at Balenciaga and turmoil at its flagship Gucci brand. The conglomerate, which has come under pressure from the activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners, has already taken steps to shake things up, like replacing Gucci’s C.E.O.
The fashion industry has long been waiting for Kering’s next steps. The company has billions in free cash flow and a need to keep up with LVMH, so bankers have speculated about what would come next. The conglomerate’s last deal, the $3.8 billion takeover of the perfume company Creed, represented a big move by Kering into beauty.
The Valentino deal is more squarely in its wheelhouse, allowing Kering to use its huge distribution platform to supercharge sales of the luxury brand.
An interesting facet of the transaction is that Kering is starting with a minority stake, a rarity in big luxury deals. There are some potential explanations for that: It could give the companies time to work out their creative vision before a potential full takeover of Valentino, or it could allow Kering to shut out possible rivals without having to buy the entirety of the brand right away.
Will more luxury M.&A. emerge? Though analysts had speculated that Valentino would pursue an I.P.O., selling gives it an immediate cash boost. And as LVMH and Kering continue to pursue scale, investors will speculate about whether other independent brands — including Armani, Burberry, Ferragamo and Prada — may become targets as well.

Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, is one of the architects of new guidelines for how courts should review mergers.

Tom Brenner for The New York Times
An argument for how not to fix flawed mergers
Despite setbacks in court, the Biden administration’s top competition cops — Lina Khan of the F.T.C. and Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department’s antitrust division — have signaled that they’ll continue to be tough on reviewing mergers.
But proposed merger guidelines released last week are still flawed, according to Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, and Carl Shapiro, another Obama economic official. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, they write that while mergers should be closely scrutinized, the guidelines risk turning what are rules based on widely accepted economic principles into, potentially, a political football:
They contain a structural presumption against many vertical mergers unsupported by theory or evidence. The proposed guideline on acquisitions of products or services that rivals may use to compete includes legal wishful thinking about how commitments made by the merging parties are treated, as the recent court rebuke of the F.T.C.’s attempt to block Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision illustrates.
Likewise, a new guideline states that “mergers should not entrench or extend a dominant position,” where a “dominant position” means a market share of at least 30 percent. As we read this guideline, many nonhorizontal deals that enable the acquiring firm to become more efficient, and thus gain market share or compete more effectively in adjacent markets, would be considered illegal even if they benefit consumers and workers. If this isn’t the intention, revisions are needed.
“Pricing the priceless”
Climate change is impossible to ignore as wildfire smoke dulls the skies across continents and air and water temperatures soar to new highs. That makes it especially timely to consider novel approaches to addressing the climate crisis, says Paula DiPerna, author of a new book, “Pricing the Priceless: The Financial Transformation to Value the Planet, Solve the Climate Crisis, and Protect Our Most Precious Assets.”
Ms. DiPerna spoke to DealBook this week. The interview has been edited and condensed.
What’s the idea behind your argument?
The principle is that nature is an unpaid worker providing services, like carbon sequestration, soil retention, water filtration, replenishing raw materials and more. It is providing an invisible subsidy to world economies. Protecting the environment is portfolio management.
How would placing a price tag on nature help?
Take carbon pricing. If you can put a value on a ton of carbon dioxide, which we can do now, then why wouldn’t it be feasible to pay countries to not drill for oil or cut their trees, to protect resources instead of exploiting them?
Poor countries that have abundant natural resources are loaning their economic resources, like the carbon-sequestering value of their rainforests, to rich countries without compensation. Last year at COP [the U.N. climate conference], [Special Presidential Envoy for Climate] John Kerry practically begged the Democratic Republic of the Congo not to drill for oil in rainforest and peat lands, which would release lots of carbon, and the retort was “pay us.” It’s not a bad answer, actually.
Are there examples of successful projects for preserving natural resources?
The Forest Resilience Bond is the brainchild of four Berkeley graduate students. What they did was look at standing forests in the Lake Tahoe area as infrastructure. And they raised funds to maintain the forest — like you would for an infrastructure project — from the beneficiaries of the environment, such as the local wildlife service, the tourism industry, insurers and even hydropower companies that rely on standing forest to replenish groundwater. That kind of bond could be done all around the world.
Why add such a pricing structure when economies can exploit nature for free?
We are facing real costs now. Nature is the thing underpinning our economies and it is a depreciating asset. We speculate about price all the time when it comes to company valuations. Yet the atmosphere is worth nothing. We need a new kind of thinking.

2023-07-31,"When The New York Times reported in April that a contractor had purchased and deployed a spying tool made by NSO, the contentious Israeli hacking firm, for use by the U.S. government, White House officials said they were unaware of the contract and put the F.B.I. in charge of figuring out who might have been using the technology.
After an investigation, the F.B.I. uncovered at least part of the answer: It was the F.B.I.
The deal for the surveillance tool between the contractor, Riva Networks, and NSO was completed in November 2021. Only days before, the Biden administration had put NSO on a Commerce Department blacklist, which effectively banned U.S. firms from doing business with the company. For years, NSO’s spyware had been abused by governments around the world.
This particular tool, known as Landmark, allowed government officials to track people in Mexico without their knowledge or consent.
The F.B.I. now says that it used the tool unwittingly and that Riva Networks misled the bureau. Once the agency discovered in late April that Riva had used the spying tool on its behalf, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, terminated the contract, according to U.S. officials.
But many questions remain. Why did the F.B.I. hire this contractor — which the bureau had previously authorized to purchase a different NSO tool under a cover name — for sensitive information-gathering operations outside the United States? And why was there apparently so little oversight?
It is also unclear which, if any, government agencies besides the F.B.I. might have worked with Riva Networks to deploy the spying tool in Mexico. Two people with direct knowledge of the contract said cellphone numbers in Mexico were targeted throughout 2021, 2022 and into this year — far longer than the F.B.I. says the tool was used.

EZRA KLEIN: From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.”
ROGÉ KARMA: Hey, everyone. As you’ve probably noticed already, there’s a different voice behind the mic today. My name is Rogé, and I’m the senior editor for the show. Ezra is officially on book leave for the next few months, so we’re going to be having a range of different guest hosts subbing in while he’s away, starting with yours truly. So let’s get to it.
A few months ago, the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, gave a speech that I think is the single clearest distillation of how the Biden administration is thinking about this moment for the global economy. In that speech, he argued that the world is experiencing something of an economic paradigm shift. For a whole host of reasons, from climate change to the rise of China to Russia’s weaponization of its energy resources, the era of unfettered globalization and free markets is ending, and according to Sullivan, we’re entering into a new era that requires very different kinds of policies and institutions.
The speech really stood out to me because over the last few years, most economics coverage has been dominated by the inflation story, but this, to me, is the much bigger economic story that’s been simmering in the background. The global economy is undergoing a series of big tectonic shifts, many of which are years and years in the making, and policymakers around the world are trying to figure out how exactly to respond to them."

2023-08-03,"The smartphone industry is in a tailspin, with unit sales falling for two straight years, but Apple has escaped the worst of the downturn because wealthy customers continue buying pricey iPhones.
The world’s most valuable tech company, which relies on the iPhone for half its sales, reported on Thursday that revenue fell 1 percent, to $81.8 billion, during the three months that ended in June. Profit increased 2 percent, to $19.88 billion.
While Apple did not experience the rapid growth that investors have come to expect over the years, and the sales decline was the third of its fiscal year, the company narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and profit for the quarter.
Apple’s financial results were the latest indication that tech’s biggest companies have found their footing after last year’s downturn. Last week, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reported double-digit growth in profits driven by a rebound in digital ad sales. Microsoft posted a record quarterly profit behind a surge in cloud-computing sales, and Amazon on Thursday posted nearly twice the profit expected by Wall Street.

The tech industry limped through much of 2022 because of weak digital ad, e-commerce and computer sales. The downturn led Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon to lay off thousands of workers and spurred companies across Silicon Valley to cut back on perks such as free laundry services for employees.
Though Apple avoided layoffs, it is now dealing with how much the pandemic turbocharged its business. Sales of iPads and Macs exploded as people began working from home, but new purchases of tablets and computers have sputtered over the past year. In the latest quarter, iPad sales decreased 20 percent, to $5.79 billion, and Mac sales declined 7 percent, to $6.84 billion, the company said.
Apple’s share price fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the company projected that sales in the current quarter would be similar to the April-to-June period, as accelerating iPhone and software sales are offset by double-digit declines in sales of Macs and iPads.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Apple continues to be buoyed by the resilience of its iPhone business. While smartphone rivals Samsung and Vivo have experienced sharp declines in sales of low-priced phones, Apple has increased its market share and expanded its sales in emerging markets and China. The company is benefiting as tech-savvy customers with deeper pockets opt to spend more on phones with sophisticated features. Monthly payment plans make it easier to pay for those devices.
In the June quarter, the company made $39.67 billion from iPhone sales, down 2 percent from a year earlier. In China, where total smartphone industry sales fell 4 percent during the quarter to their lowest levels since 2014, iPhone sales increased 7 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm. That helped Apple post 8 percent sales growth in China, bucking the broader malaise buffeting the world’s second-largest economy.

“We’ve done a really good job with affordability programs around the world,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, during a call with analysts. “The majority of iPhones are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing.”
The company weathered declines in sales of its devices with continued growth in App Store and watch sales. The company’s services business, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, App Store sales and Apple Pay, posted $21.21 billion in sales, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. The wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, reported that sales rose 2 percent, to $8.28 billion.
Apple will continue to lean on its existing businesses for the bulk of sales in the coming years. In June, the company unveiled its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. But the $3,500 device, the Vision Pro, won’t go on sale until next year. Analysts project that Apple will sell fewer than half a million units, a small fraction of the roughly 200 million iPhones that it sells annually.
In the absence of a major new revenue stream, the company has focused on boosting sales in developing markets. It opened its first stores in India in April and welcomed crowds of eager shoppers. Its sales there have doubled in recent quarters from last year, as more and more Indians buy higher-priced phones. The rise in sales puts Apple in a position to capitalize on a market that is predicted to have a billion smartphone users by 2026.
“While I’m pleased with our growth there, we still have a very, very modest and low share of the smartphone market,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, during the call with analysts. “It’s a huge opportunity for us.”
Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in September, as well as updated models of the Apple Watch.

What iPhones and online shopping reveal about the economy
Earnings reports yesterday from Apple and Amazon covered some very different businesses: premium-priced smartphones and tablets versus the world’s “everything store” and a dominant cloud computing platform.
But the tech giants provided a snapshot of the state of the global economy: Consumers and companies are cutting back on some costs, but refusing to stop spending on increasingly essential services.
A tale of two businesses at Apple. The company’s sales slumped for another quarter, even as profit went up slightly compared with a year ago, to $19.88 billion. Much of the revenue decline was caused by a drop in iPhone sales, which comprise half of Apple’s overall revenue. (Sales of iPads fared far worse, with tablet revenue down 20 percent.)
But revenue from services — including Apple Music, Apple TV+ and App Store sales — grew 8 percent, reaching a record $21 billion. It’s a sign that even as customers stop buying pricey new handsets as regularly as they did in the past, they’re committed to smaller-ticket subscriptions and purchases that add up to big money (and carry an astonishing 70 percent gross margin).
Apple also showed growth in key international markets. Sales rose 8 percent in China, the company’s third-biggest market, despite severe economic headwinds there. In India, the company set a record for iPhone sales.
Cost cuts helped power big gains at Amazon. The e-commerce giant handily beat Wall Street’s expectations, as net income of 65 cents per share nearly doubled forecasts. The company enjoyed a surge in its core online retail business, showing that customers are still spending despite headwinds like rising interest rates.
But just as important was how Amazon boosted those results through extensive cost-cutting efforts, including tens of thousands of layoffs and shutting unprofitable divisions. (A slowdown in inflation also helped cut transportation costs.)
The big question is whether other companies’ efforts to shed their own costs will erode Amazon’s other big business, cloud computing: Its AWS division reported 12 percent growth for the quarter, mirroring what Microsoft reported for its competing offering. “Every company in the world is trying to save as much money as they can,” Andy Jassy, Amazon’s C.E.O., told analysts.

What investors think: Shares of Apple are down 1.8 percent in premarket trading, while those in Amazon are up nearly 9 percent.
In other earnings news: Warner Bros. Discovery narrowed its quarterly loss year on year, to $1.24 billion, and lost more streaming customers than analysts had forecast. (The huge success of “Barbie” at the box office will be reflected next quarter.)

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Economists are watching for signs of a cooling labor market. Jobs numbers for July are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and forecasters expect a gain of 200,000 — the smallest increase in 31 months. Fed officials will study the report for signs of cooling wage growth ahead of their rate-setting meeting in September. (Company executives have said recently they’ve slowed down hiring and been worried about rising labor costs.)
Donald Trump pleads not guilty to the latest charges against him. The former president appeared in a Washington courtroom to face accusations that he sought to subvert the 2020 election results. But Trump remained defiant, calling the charges “political persecution,” and there’s little sign his growing legal troubles are hurting his standing among G.O.P. voters.
Saudi Arabia extends oil production cuts. The kingdom said it would limit output by one million barrels a day for another month, through September, as China’s tepid economic recovery keeps a lid on global crude prices. The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose following the Saudi announcement.
KKR is said to be in advanced talks to buy Simon & Schuster. The investment giant is poised to pay $1.65 billion if a deal is reached, according to The Wall Street Journal. Still, the bid for the publishing giant is lower than the $2.2 billion that its rival, Penguin Random House, had offered in a transaction that was blocked by a federal judge last year.

A clash over an N.B.A. team’s donation to DeSantis
It’s no secret that N.B.A. team owners are often big political donors, with most of their money historically going to Republicans. But the revelation this week that the Orlando Magic — the team, not the conservative DeVos family that owns it — gave $50,000 to a super PAC supporting Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida raised eyebrows.
The fact that the players’ union issued a sharp rebuke of the move underscored how politics, wealth and pro sports can become uncomfortably intertwined.

It appears to be the first time that a team has directly supported a group allied with a presidential candidate. A spokesman for the Magic said that the donation, which was dated May 19, was made before DeSantis officially announced his candidacy, but it was already clear that he would run.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
In its statement, the N.B.A. Players Association called the move “alarming given recent comments and policies of its beneficiary.”
DeSantis’s platform clashes with the stated positions of a number of N.B.A. players. The Republican governor has risen to prominence with so-called anti-woke policies, and has pushed for strict bans on abortions and efforts to tighten voting regulations — both of which run counter to player initiatives and public statements.
DeSantis also introduced new state standards for the teaching of African American history, which critics say play down the brutality of slavery. (That move was announced after the Magic’s donation.) Larry Nance Jr., a player for the New Orleans Pelicans, noted that the Magic have “a majority Black roster, a Black head coach and a Black G.M.”
The league is in a bind. Under Adam Silver, its commissioner, the N.B.A. has mostly welcomed players’ political activism, including on Black Lives Matter and on laws discriminating against L.G.B.T.Q. people. But it is overseen by a board of governors that is largely made up of owners.
For now, the N.B.A. is staying neutral: “Team governors make their own decisions on the political contributions they make and we respect the right of members of the N.B.A. family to express their political views,” a spokesman told The Times.
But the players’ union said that while owners were free to express political opinions, “if contributions are made on behalf of an entire team, using money earned through the labor of its employees, it is incumbent upon the team governors to consider the diverse values and perspectives of staff and players.”

The chipmaker in the middle of a geopolitical fight
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company sits at the center of the technological cold war between the U.S. and China: It dominates production of the world’s most advanced chips from its base in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own and has threatened to invade.
TSMC’s top executives acknowledged to The Times that while the company commands a crucial position in the global tech supply chain, it is still subject to a geopolitical battle beyond their control.

TSMC is a $500 billion juggernaut that makes chips for everything from iPhones to supercomputers to cars to fighter jets. That has given it both market dominance and global political importance. U.S. export controls have made it harder for Chinese companies to gain access to the most advanced semiconductors, and Washington is weighing new restrictions on chips for artificial intelligence.
“We control all the choke points,” Morris Chang, the company’s founder, said, referring to Western powers and its chip-making allies, including the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. He played down Beijing’s chances for semiconductor supremacy: “China can’t really do anything if we want to choke them,” he added.
TSMC has already cut off supplies to Chinese customers, including in 2020 the telecom giant Huawei, its second-biggest customer at the time. Mark Liu, TSMC’s chief, said that it had no choice: “It’s understandable, but support or not, we have no say.”
But TSMC is still moored to Taiwan. Western countries have courted the company to build plants outside the island, but its experience with its $40 billion project in Arizona — which has suffered from delays, high costs and managerial challenges — has hammered home that its power is strongly tied to Taiwan. “We cannot put it anyplace else,” Liu said.
The TSMC chief rejected the idea of a “silicon shield,” whereby the company’s manufacturing expertise would deter a Chinese invasion or guarantee U.S. support for Taiwan. “China will not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors. China will not not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors,” he said. “It is really up to the U.S. and China: How do they maintain the status quo, which both sides want?”
“This year has really marked the end of an era.”

The buyback boom is tailing off
For over a decade, companies believed that the surest way to bolster their stock price was to buy back their shares, rather than invest in more plants or research and development. Shareholders rejoiced — but politicians assailed the practice as shortsighted and benefiting only investors and executives.
The corporate thinking about buybacks appears to be changing, according to Bloomberg:

With tightening credit muting share repurchases, and the siren song of artificial intelligence blaring everywhere, outlays for investment on plants and technology have blossomed. The median company pushed up capital expenditures by 15 percent in [the second quarter], with three-quarters announcing programs that topped analyst estimates in July, data from Bank of America Corp. shows.
By contrast, buybacks among corporate clients have been tracking below seasonal trends since May. More broadly, net repurchases plunged 36 percent from a year ago among S.&P. 500 firms that announced financial results. And the reluctance is also on display via planned buybacks, which according to Birinyi Associates have fallen 15 percent year-to-date.

2023-08-07,"Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, has for years been doing preliminary work for what would be one of the world’s largest offshore wind complexes, in the North Sea off eastern England.
Now, there are questions about whether this project will ever be built. Last month, Vattenfall said it would halt the first of three phases of the wind farm complex, the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone, which is projected to provide power for about four million homes in Britain.
Vattenfall blamed rapidly escalating costs for equipment and construction expenses, which it said had climbed as much as 40 percent over the past few quarters. The estimated price tag for the three phases has risen to 13 billion pounds, or about $16.6 billion, from £10 billion.
“With the new market conditions, it simply doesn’t make sense to continue the project,” Helene Bistrom, head of business area wind at Vattenfall, said during a video presentation. The decision led Vattenfall, which the Swedish government owns, to write down more than $500 million.

Vattenfall’s pullback added to the widespread alarm unfolding across the offshore industry about rapidly increasing costs, due partly to supply chain issues and rising demand.
In recent months, several developers in the United States have sought to renegotiate power supply contracts, scrapping them in at least one case, and Orsted, a Danish company that is the world’s largest offshore wind developer, warned that a major project in Britain, Hornsea 3, could be “at risk” without more government support.

With interest rates shooting up, financing the billions of dollars in investment that go into these installations has also become far more expensive.
On Monday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy reported a net loss of 2.9 billion euros ($3.2 billion) for the April-to-June quarter, largely due to problems tied to “increased product costs and ramp-up challenges” in its offshore energy business.

“There’s very few projects that are immune to the inflationary impact,” said Finlay Clark, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm.

Rising costs for wind developers are a problem for governments in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. Many countries are counting on an enormous and rapid expansion of offshore wind to achieve a significant portion of their renewable energy goals.
“We are wasting time here,” Morten Dyrholm, group senior vice president for corporate affairs at Vestas Wind Systems, the Danish turbine maker, said of the industry’s problems. “We need to grow the sector quite dramatically.”
Mr. Dyrholm and others in the industry say the inflation problems are a warning sign that governments need to change their system of awarding offshore wind licenses.
The procedures for obtaining the rights to build wind farms vary in different countries but often involve an auction of seabed leases followed, sometimes years later, by agreements that set the price paid by power companies for the electricity generated.

These arrangements, designed to drive down power prices for consumers and, often, to maximize revenues from lease sales, should be broadened to take into account other factors, some industry leaders say. An auction for seabed rights awarded by Scotland in 2022 is cited as a model because it put greater emphasis on factors like the ability of wind companies to develop suppliers, and the experience of the companies.
The debate could open the way for more power deals with corporations like Amazon and Microsoft, whose data centers are hungry consumers of electricity. Large businesses might be more flexible partners for wind developers than government officials who tend to say, “This is the rule,” said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utilities analyst at Bernstein, a research firm.
Renewable energy programs like Britain’s — which is designed to encourage financial backing by providing a guaranteed price to wind developers, and to gradually drive down charges paid by consumers — attracted billions in investment when inflation was low. Now, in a very different world, after the disruptions of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Britain is taking fire for policies that could make wind projects uneconomical.
“I am afraid the U.K. has gone from being one of the best governments in Europe on offshore wind to one of the worst,” said Giles Dickson, chief executive of WindEurope, a trade body.

A British government spokesman responded: “We understand there are supply chain pressures for the sector globally, not just in the U.K., and we are listening to companies’ concerns.”

The inflation problems are mainly hitting offshore wind farms in late stages of development rather than those already generating power.
Offshore projects can require a decade to progress from planning stages to generating power. That means agreements on issues like the power price may be years old before the turbines are in place and generating electricity.
That system worked when inflation was negligible and demand for turbines and other equipment was relatively subdued. Now, as a growing number of developers look to secure everything necessary to undertake the projects — from wind turbines, which cost millions of dollars, to the services of specialized construction ships, to bank financing — they discover that the price tags have suddenly soared. Mr. Dyrholm estimates that prices of wind turbines alone have increased 30 percent in the past year.
“The costs have risen, and you have a mismatch,” said Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP, which is an investor, with Equinor, a Norwegian company, in three offshore wind projects in the Atlantic that would supply power to around two million households in New York State. Equinor and BP have petitioned state authorities to renegotiate their power contracts.

Similarly, developers in Britain and elsewhere don’t seem to want to completely jettison projects. Many are trying to renegotiate the deals or push governments to alter the formats of future auctions. Some are terminating existing contracts to supply power to utilities and seeking new ones — or threatening such moves, figuring there will be plenty of demand for clean power in the future.
Walking away from contracts signed years ago has become “the prudent commercial course” even with the risk of financial penalties, SouthCoast Wind, a project part-owned by Shell that would be located in the Atlantic near Martha’s Vineyard, in Massachusetts, said in a statement in June.
Another Massachusetts proposal, Commonwealth Wind, which is owned by Avangrid, a U.S. subsidiary of the Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, has terminated its power supply contract and plans to seek a new deal in a future auction, the company said.
“The economics are challenging,” said Stephanie McClellan, executive director of Turn Forward, an offshore wind advocacy organization in the United States.

Despite the soured deals, interest in offshore wind remains strong. In a recent auction in Germany, BP and TotalEnergies in France agreed to pay around $14 billion over three decades for offshore tracts.
The German deals differ from others because the companies are simply paying for the rights to develop sea bottom, and they will negotiate what  they are paid for the electricity at a later date.
Such deals are attractive to a corporate giant like BP, which has the financial firepower to make them happen and would be freer to do what it wants with the power. Mr. Looney said he hoped to steer away from the long-term power contracts, preferring instead to try to squeeze more value from wind-generated electricity by using it to make green hydrogen, a still scarce clean fuel, or charge electric vehicles.
“We’d like to do something with those electrons — take them and put them to use,” he said.
But there are only a handful of companies with the heft of BP and TotalEnergies. Whether nations can achieve their offshore ambitions through such commercial deals remains to be seen. Critics say charging high prices for leases will lead to higher power prices for consumers."

2023-08-11,"Give the stock market half a chance and it will dominate the financial headlines. That was certainly the case for the month of July, with the S&P 500 powering upward and bonds barely treading water.
But August has been different, with the stock market hitting a speed bump and the bond market getting attention for an unwelcome reason: a downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency. Fitch says the deterioration in political consensus and the increasing debt levels of the United States mean that it no longer ranks unequivocally as among the safest places to invest in the world.
That’s significant. Because the enduring appeal of bonds comes from their relative safety — and not from spectacular gains and losses that define the stock market’s flamboyant brand — the Fitch downgrade can’t be easily dismissed.
Yet it makes sense to hold U.S. debt anyway, despite tremors in the bond market. You may not think much about bonds, but there’s a good chance that you have a stake in them, if only indirectly: through a fund, especially in a workplace defined-contribution retirement account, like a 401(k), or through a pension or an annuity.
Because bonds are so often overlooked, it’s worth going over some basics.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Stocks vs. Bonds
Stocks are inherently speculative. They provide fractional ownership of a company and are a bet that the value of your shares will appreciate. Often, you get dividends, but a company isn’t required to pay them.
Bonds, on the other hand, are a loan to a company or a government, like the United States, which is generally obligated to pay you interest and, at a certain date, repay your principal, too. Should a company — or a country — run into financial trouble, bondholders customarily have high status among creditors. These features typically make bonds less risky than stocks.
But bonds contain a speculative element, too. Even the safest bonds do.
The conventional wisdom is that U.S. Treasuries are the safest bonds, a claim that has given them an exalted status as the benchmark from which all other asset values may be measured. The “risk-free” rate provided by Treasuries is used in finance as the hurdle that every other investment — a stock or a capital project or a buyout of a private company — must clear to be deemed even minimally viable as a place to put your money.
U.S. Treasuries constitute an extraordinarily deep and nimble $25.1 trillion market. It’s no exaggeration to say that the entire world’s financial system is based on U.S. Treasuries, and calibrated against Treasury rates.
That’s still the case. But it’s difficult to assert with a straight face that U.S. Treasuries are really risk free — not after the losses in the bond market last year, or the “perils-of-Pauline” brushes with disaster in multiple debt ceiling crises. The Fitch debt downgrade is a reasonable response to those crises.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Interest Rate Risk
Investors in high-quality bonds, and, especially, Treasuries, face two significant problems: interest rate risk and credit risk.
To understand interest rate risk, recall that bond prices and interest rates (a.k.a. yields) move in opposite directions. That’s how bonds work. In 2013, when it looked like rates were rising, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a bulletin on interest rate risk, which I thought was particularly apt, comparing bond prices and interest rates to the two ends of a playground seesaw (or teeter-totter, if you’re from the Midwest). When one side rises, the other falls. Every child in the playground learns that soon enough. Bond investors do, too.
Last year, the seesaw crashed. Because of soaring inflation and the Federal Reserve’s effort to curb it by raising short-term rates, bond market rates rose and prices plummeted. It was the worst year for bond investors since the 1920s, and, probably much longer, as I wrote in late 2022.
But now, with yields already much higher than they have been over most of the past decade — most rose a bit after a government report on Thursday showed that core inflation was still sizzling at 4.7 percent a year — a repetition of last year’s severe bond losses is extremely unlikely.
Yes, yields could still rise further if inflation remains high, and that could lead to modest short-term losses in bond funds or, if you trade them, in individual bonds. That’s especially true for bonds with longer maturities.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Inflation’s not the only problem. The U.S. Treasury is pouring new debt into the market while the Fed, which had been the biggest domestic purchaser of Treasuries, has gotten out of that game as it tightens financial conditions to fight inflation. The appetites of China and Japan, big foreign buyers of Treasuries, may be diminishing. These incremental shifts in supply and demand may well increase rates marginally and depress prices.
All of this is why money market funds — which track interest rate shifts closely and do not decline in price when yields rise — may be a better short-term bet than bonds for the next month or two, with money-market yields well above 5 percent.
Even so, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury already above 4 percent, bond yields are high enough to provide a buffer and substantial enough for high-quality bonds to perform their traditional functions: generating income and providing a counterweight to stocks.
But that brings us to credit risk and the Fitch downgrade.
What About the Downgrade?
High-yield bonds self-evidently entail credit risk. They are called junk bonds for a reason. Companies are forced to pay higher yields precisely because of the risk that they won’t make good on their debt. If you can accept the risk and do some research — or have a prudent manager do it for you — junk bonds can be lucrative, much like stocks.
But I’m focusing here on using bonds for their traditional purpose as a relatively stable income provider, offsetting the volatility of stocks. Investment grade bonds, either corporate or government, are good choices. (Inflation-adjusted bonds and municipal bonds can be worthwhile, too, but I’ll discuss them another day.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The safest of U.S. bonds are still Treasuries, in my view, though Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson bonds have higher credit ratings. But would those companies be great credit risks if the U.S. government defaulted on its debt? I have my doubts.
Many countries now have better credit ratings than the United States, including Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. The United States still has a pristine grade from Moody’s. Standard & Poor’s downgraded U.S. debt one notch in 2011 and Fitch followed suit this month. I fully expect Moody’s to do the same one day, if the United States continues to flirt with debt default.
The issue is governance, not financial stress. As Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, says, the United States remains the most powerful economy and country in the world. The global bond market is willing and able to absorb all of the debt that is being issued by the U.S. Treasury.
Yet the core problem is profound. The political system in the United States has become sufficiently dysfunctional that fiscal policy is an exercise in brinkmanship. The specter of a debt default is no longer unthinkable. How much money the United States should spend and how much it should raise through taxation — and by taxing whom, exactly — have always been difficult issues. But bipartisan compromises have become rare achievements in Washington.
If Fitch didn’t provide new information, it set off a warning flag.
U.S. credit is still strong, though not as great as it was. Treasuries remain essential in nearly everyone’s portfolio. But until a semblance of consensus on fiscal matters is restored, the world will be bearing unnecessary risk."

2023-08-16,"Earlier this year, Google, locked in an accelerating competition with rivals like Microsoft and OpenAI to develop A.I. technology, was looking for ways to put a charge into its artificial intelligence research.
So in April, Google merged DeepMind, a research lab it had acquired in London, with Brain, an artificial intelligence team it started in Silicon Valley.
Four months later, the combined groups are testing ambitious new tools that could turn generative A.I. — the technology behind chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s own Bard — into a personal life coach.
Google DeepMind has been working with generative A.I. to perform at least 21 different types of personal and professional tasks, including tools to give users life advice, ideas, planning instructions and tutoring tips, according to documents and other materials reviewed by The New York Times.
The project was indicative of the urgency of Google’s effort to propel itself to the front of the A.I. pack and signaled its increasing willingness to trust A.I. systems with sensitive tasks.
The capabilities also marked a shift from Google’s earlier caution on generative A.I. In a slide deck presented to executives in December, the company’s A.I. safety experts had warned of the dangers of people becoming too emotionally attached to chatbots.

Market whiplash
In the span of a month, the bottom has dropped out of the bull-market rally as investors have come to grips with the prospect of “higher for longer” interest rates worldwide. The sell-off in global stocks and bonds picked up steam on Thursday. And weary market watchers will be looking for more hints on the Fed’s view at next week’s Jackson Hole summit of central bankers and policymakers.
Technology stocks have been hit particularly hard. The high-flying FANG+ Index — which comprises the largest tech stocks by market capitalization, including Apple, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — fell into correction territory on Thursday. The group of Nasdaq heavyweights is down nearly 11 percent since July 18.

High-growth tech stocks tend to be sensitive to rising interest rates and bond yields. They rallied earlier in the year on investors’ belief that the Fed was pivoting to a more dovish rates policy, which could inspire a rebound in tech spending. (Investors’ voracious appetite for stocks that could benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence also fueled the tech rally.)
Just a month ago, Wall Street was hailing the so-called “magnificent seven” for driving the gains this year in the S&P 500. As MarketWatch notes, four of the seven (Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft) have fallen at least 10 percent from their highs in July. Tesla, the worst of the bunch, has tumbled more than 25 percent in that period, putting it in bear territory.

Rising bond yields have investors on edge. On Thursday, alarm bells sounded on both sides of the Atlantic as investors sold government bonds en masse, sending yields to multiyear highs. The 10-year Treasury note climbed to a height it last hit in the early days of the global financial crisis in 2008.
This sentiment trickled down to stocks and crypto. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the largest cryptocurrencies, plunged overnight, with Bitcoin sinking to a two-month low below $26,500. The Wall Street Journal’s report that SpaceX, Elon Musk’s rocket company, wrote down the value of its Bitcoin stake over the past two years and sold some of it hasn’t improved sentiment around the highly volatile asset class.
China’s woes are also weighing on global markets. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong fell into a bear market on Friday as investors pulled back on Chinese stocks with the economy slowing and a property-market crisis brewing. Also on Friday, analysts at Nomura were the latest to lower their forecast for China’s growth. Adding to the jitters, the renminbi hit a 16-year low against the dollar on Friday, prompting emergency moves to prop up the currency. That did little to soothe investors’ nerves.

Country Garden, another developer, missed international debt payments this month amid a wider economic slowdown in China.
Instacart is reportedly planning an I.P.O. as early as next month. The country’s largest online grocery delivery company is pursuing a traditional listing on Nasdaq after considering a direct listing, according to Bloomberg. Separately, Arm, the chip designer owned by SoftBank, has lined up 28 banks to underwrite an I.P.O. that could be the biggest this year, Bloomberg reported.
Mortgage rates hit a 21-year high. The lending giant Freddie Mac said on Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage, the most common home loan in America, surpassed 7 percent this week; a year ago it was at 5.19 percent. Ballooning rates for financing and a tight supply of homes are pricing an increasing number of Americans out of the housing market.

A full-metal fight
A cornerstone of President Biden’s effort to counter China is to secure access to the commodities critical to supply-chain security. An emerging bidding war for U.S. Steel could test that ambition in a sector dominated by Chinese rivals.

But a brewing geopolitical fight on the other side of the world could have even longer-term consequences for the economy and the Biden administration’s plans to power an energy transition.

Cleveland-Cliffs started the bidding for U.S. Steel with a $10 billion offer. A successful bid would add to consolidation of a U.S. industry that has dwindled to four major companies: Cleveland-Cliffs, U.S. Steel, Nucor and Steel Dynamics. China is the world’s biggest producer by far, accounting for about half of global production; the United States ranks fourth.
U.S. Steel publicly rejected the initial offer. The company called the Cleveland-Cliffs terms “unreasonable” and announced a formal review process. The United Steelworkers supported Cleveland-Cliffs’ bid, but manufacturers worry that more consolidation would give steel makers outsized power to raise prices and squeeze customers.
Another major metals fight worth watching is unfolding in Indonesia. The country has the world’s biggest reserves of nickel, a mineral used in electric vehicle batteries — and a key material in the green economy. The Biden administration has offered billions of dollars in subsidies to spur EV manufacturing, and the energy transition is a crucial aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act.
But Indonesia’s nickel industry relies on Chinese companies for investment and technology. That is complicating Jakarta’s efforts to build ties with global companies that want to get access to the country’s reserves and to American tax credits via the I.R.A. The Indonesian government had been wooing Tesla to build a factory, but the company set up its Southeast Asian headquarters in Malaysia instead.
That may give China another opening. Indonesian officials are considering other options, including stepping up efforts to convince BYD, China’s largest EV maker, to set up shop. “We are aiming basically to the United States,” Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, one of Indonesia’s most powerful ministers, told The Times’s Peter Goodman. “But if the Americans finally say, ‘We don’t want to take it,’ fine, we’ll look for some other places to go.”
$38 million
— The amount Spotify could add in profits by steering listeners away from white noise podcasts, according to Bloomberg. The company’s algorithm pushed users looking for “talk” content to shows that broadcast everything from whale noises to bird song on repeat. But those users typically remain on the free, ad-supported version of the platform instead of opting for the subscription shows that are more lucrative for Spotify. The company considered directing listeners to shows that made more money, but didn’t put the plan into action.

What’s next for Hawaiian Electric?
The death toll from the wildfires that have ripped across Maui stands at 111, and focus is turning to what led the blaze to become one of the country’s worst natural disasters in decades. Maui’s emergency management chief resigned last night as questions swirled over the decision not to use outdoor alert sirens. Hawaiian Electric, the state’s largest utility, is also facing major scrutiny.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It could take months for officials to assess the company’s role — if any — in the blaze. But markets fear the worst. Hawaiian Electric shares have fallen by more than 65 percent since Aug. 7, the day before the wildfire started. On Friday, Moody’s was the latest credit ratings firm to downgrade Hawaiian Electric as potential liabilities mount.
A big question is whether the company will be forced to follow a similar path to Pacific Gas and Electric, the California-based utility company that filed for bankruptcy in 2019 under the burden of wildfire liabilities.
The factors to watch include whether insurance can cover Hawaiian Electric’s massive rebuilding costs, and the size of its potential liabilities. At least four lawsuits have already been filed, contending the company was negligent in operating and maintaining equipment.
Evidence is building. Videos and photos posted from Maui appear to show power lines starting fires. In addition, data from Whisker Labs, a company that monitors electrical grids for fire hazards, seems to identify faults on power lines in the area where the fires started.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
There’s an important difference between Hawaiian Electric and PG&E. California has inverse indemnification laws, which makes it easier to hold public utility companies like PG&E liable. Hawaii has no such regulations, meaning litigants will have the higher bar of proving management is to blame.
Would Hawaii allow the company to file for bankruptcy? Regardless of how bad Hawaiian Electric’s financial situation becomes, Hawaii may not want to allow its largest utility to go bankrupt. That could delay rebuilding on the island.
The state has been through big bankruptcies before, including those of Hawaiian Airlines in 2008 and Liberty House, its largest retailer, in 1998. Working to keep the company out of bankruptcy could be seen as a more politically fraught option, versus handing over questions about its future to a judge.

2023-08-21,"In 2007, Linda Stone, a former Microsoft executive, realized that even though she did breathing exercises every morning, when she sat down at her laptop and opened up her inbox, it all went out the window. “I would be like, Huh, I was just breathing but I’m not breathing anymore,” she said. Her inhales and exhales became barely detectable and shallow, she noticed.
Ms. Stone decided to conduct an informal study (“dining room table science,” she called it), inviting 200 people into her home — friends, neighbors, family members — and monitoring their heart rate and breathing while they checked their email. Roughly 80 percent of participants periodically held their breath or altered their breathing, she said. She named the phenomenon “email apnea” and described her findings in a widely read 2008 piece in The Huffington Post.
Ms. Stone has since expanded the concept and renamed it “screen apnea,” referring to the disruption of breathing many of us experience doing all kinds of tasks in front of a screen.
The issue has most likely worsened with our increased use of screens, said James Nestor, who examined the phenomenon in his 2020 book, “Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art.”
“You have 10 different screens open. Someone’s texting you, someone’s calling you, someone’s emailing you,” he said, adding that we have not evolved to be “constantly stimulated.”
Screen apnea is a manifestation of our body’s stress response, said Stephen Porges, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in the autonomic nervous system. When we’re faced with any kind of stimuli, our nervous system looks for signals to decipher whether or not it’s a threat, Dr. Porges said.

All passengers were rescued from a cable car in Pakistan
Pakistani security forces said yesterday that they had rescued eight people, including several young students, from a stranded cable car that was left hanging above a mountain valley.
The students, including children ages 10 to 15, were headed to a nearby school in Allai, in the Battagram district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, in the morning when two of the car’s wires broke. Panic gripped the passengers and their families, who issued urgent pleas for assistance.
A video clip posted on social media showed one person being lifted to safety by a rope attached to a helicopter. But as darkness fell, helicopter operations were suspended, and a zip-line was used instead to rescue those who were still trapped, according to the Pakistani military.
The cable car is a regular mode of transportation for residents of the mountainous northern region. Around 400 to 500 people use it for commuting every day. But such locally built lifts, typically powered by petrol or diesel engines, are privately owned and tend toward relatively ad hoc construction.

Gresham’s Law says that bad money drives out good. If you have two coins with a face value of $1, you will spend the bad one that contains 25 cents’ worth of metal and stash away the good one that contains $1 worth of metal.
Something like Gresham’s Law is at work in the carbon offset market, which was set up to fight climate change. Bad carbon credits are driving out good carbon credits. And that’s a big problem for the effort to curb the greenhouse gas emissions that are heating up the planet and wreaking havoc from the Arctic to the Antarctic.
An Aug. 16 report for clients of the British bank Barclays put a positive spin on the problem but contained some worrisome information.
The Barclays report focused on the voluntary carbon market. That’s the one that companies such as Microsoft and Salesforce are using to help reach their goals of net-zero carbon emissions. If they can’t reduce their own emissions all the way to zero, they can go into the market and buy credits from someone in, say, Brazil who has earned them by planting trees to soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The voluntary carbon market can be a valuable mechanism for directing investment to developing nations that need help in the fight against climate change.
“The market will get big because we need it to get big,” Austin Whitman, the chief executive of the nonprofit Climate Neutral, told me. “We will not hit net zero without large and well-functioning carbon markets.”
Here’s the Gresham’s Law problem, though: According to the Barclays report, the price of carbon credits has fallen to around $2 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere, down from around $9 early last year.

2023-08-25,"The stock market’s monthslong rally stumbled this month. The thrill of seeing investment gains, with metronomic regularity, is gone.
I miss that feeling: scanning my investments and knowing in advance that the numbers will be larger than they were the last time I looked. But, in an important way, the market’s summer setbacks have been long awaited, and they come as something of a relief.
Don’t misunderstand. It’s not that I want to see the rising stock market stop in its tracks. I’d prefer an endless move upward, making me, and everyone else, richer.
But that’s a fantasy. In the real world, upward stock market thrusts are always temporary. When stocks rise too quickly, they inevitably fall and sometimes crash. The stock market is essentially volatile, and for every big winner, dozens of casualties occur.
That’s why, as a second-best alternative, I hope for something more modest: a choppy market that experiences periodic downturns, but one that trends upward for very long periods.
The Stock Market’s Movements
That is, in fact, a rough description of what the stock market has been like for the past 25 years, according to statistics provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.

2023-08-26,"Across the American economy, in industries ranging from air travel to veterinary medicine, big companies keep getting bigger and more powerful. Swallowing smaller rivals has become a widely accepted practice.
This concentration of corporate power, however, is neither inevitable nor desirable for the health of the American economy.
The Biden administration is embarking on a wide-ranging effort to check corporate power by promoting competition — a stated goal of both parties — and it needs Congress to support its effort with bipartisan legislation. It has proposed new rules, like a ban on noncompete agreements that prevent workers from changing jobs more freely. It is seeding competition, for example, by investing more than $1 billion to open and expand smaller meatpacking plants. And it has taken a tough line on mergers, blocking some big deals, dissuading companies from pursuing others and even suing to unwind Facebook’s 2012 acquisition of Instagram.
Last month, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, which are charged with enforcing antitrust laws, proposed new merger guidelines that would formalize this turn toward stringency, ending decades of acquiescence to corporations by both Democratic and Republican administrations. The document explains what the administration regards as illegal, creating a basis for consistent enforcement, putting companies on notice and preparing judges for the cases that may come before them.
This reassertion of an active government role in protecting competition has the potential to deliver significant benefits. Competition keeps pressure on prices. It encourages the development of better and more diverse products and services. It holds open the gates of opportunity so workers can pursue other jobs or start their own businesses. It helps to ensure that prosperity and political power are broadly distributed.
“In my view, it’s the most important economic policy thing that the Biden administration will do this year,” said Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor who served until earlier this year as President Biden’s adviser on technology and competition policy. Mr. Wu, who was not involved in creating the proposed guidelines, said the document reflected a determination to end a “green light” era in which American antitrust enforcers largely declined to enforce antitrust laws.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, plans to kick off a series of listening sessions next month on the regulation of artificial intelligence with Elon Musk of Tesla, Sundar Pichai of Google, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Satya Nadella of Microsoft.
Mr. Schumer’s office said on Monday that the tech leaders were set to convene in Washington on Sept. 13 for the first of several meetings for lawmakers to hear from A.I. experts. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, and Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, will also attend.
The “A.I. insight forums” are closed-door listening sessions for lawmakers as they try to devise regulations for A.I. technologies. Mr. Schumer, the majority leader, said the sessions were intended to educate members of Congress on the risks posed by A.I. on jobs, the spread of disinformation and intellectual property theft. Lawmakers will also learn about opportunities created by the technology in the field of research on diseases, his office said.
The Sept. 13 meeting will also include members from civil rights and labor groups and the creative community. Axios reported earlier on the details of the meeting.

Why It Matters
The guest list for the Sept. 13 forum signals the important role that tech companies will play in the creation of A.I. regulations.
To influence the debate, some tech chiefs have voiced their views on A.I. regulations to lawmakers. Mr. Altman, for instance, has become a fixture on Capitol Hill, appearing at a congressional hearing this year and meeting with more than 100 lawmakers.
Lawmakers and the White House have also leaned on the tech executives for guidance on regulations. Last month, the White House announced that Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and Meta had agreed to voluntary safeguards around their A.I. technology, including stress-testing their systems for security flaws.

But many tech companies disagree on regulations. OpenAI and Microsoft have supported the idea of having one agency regulate the technology, a proposal that IBM and Google have opposed. Mr. Musk, who also owns X, the company formerly known as Twitter, has called for a moratorium on developing some of the most advanced uses of A.I., while other tech leaders have disagreed with that approach.
Background
The United States is behind on global regulations. Europe this year is expected to enact an A.I. law that would curtail facial recognition technology and force companies like OpenAI to disclose sources of data for their technology.
The Sept. 13 meeting is set to begin a long-awaited process on rules in the United States for A.I. In June, Mr. Schumer announced a plan to start “from scratch” and educate lawmakers to come up with legislation that strikes a balance between encouraging the technology’s development and protecting individuals.
Mr. Schumer said he would host forums to learn about the risks and potential opportunities of A.I. from technologists, academics, and civil rights and labor groups. The forums could help shape legislation that could be introduced within the year."

Hurricane Idalia has strengthened to a Category 3 storm, with insurance analysts fearing it could do billions in damage.

A stormy forecast for insurance
Hurricane Idalia strengthened to a Category 3 storm on Wednesday morning, packing soaking rains and destructive winds of up to 125 miles per hour, as it lumbers toward the Florida coastline. Officials along Florida’s Gulf Coast and in Georgia and the Carolinas have issued emergency warnings, as the region braces for yet another “multibillion-dollar insurance industry event.”
Last September, Hurricane Ian, a Category 4 storm, slammed into Florida, inflicting nearly $100 billion in damage. Such disasters are becoming more common — and more costly — each year, sending insurance costs soaring for homeowners and businesses.
Insurance companies are still reeling from Ian. Some firms doubt they can continue to cope with such superstorms, while others have limited their business in the state. One of their big complaints: State regulations prevent them from raising prices for customers, they say, forcing them to say no to new policies.
Florida’s woes reflect a nationwide problem, one that is expected to intensify as climate change unleashes more extreme weather events. The Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, estimates that property and casualty insurers in the state have had cumulative underwriting losses of more than $1 billion for the last three years.
The picture is bleak elsewhere, too:

State Farm, the country’s largest insurance provider, said it would stop selling homeowners’ coverage in California, a state that has been battered by wildfires in recent years. Allstate also said it had stopped selling new home and commercial policies there, citing worsening climate risks and rising building costs.
American International Group plans to curb home insurance sales in New York, Delaware, Florida, Colorado, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, after restricting new business in California.
Not everyone views these markets as hopeless. Florida’s insurance regulator just approved Orion180 as a new insurer for the state. “We view Florida as an attractive insurance market for profitable growth over the long term,” said Kenneth Gregg, the company’s founder and C.E.O. And Berkshire Hathaway has bet big on Florida’s reinsurance market this year.
One possible enticement: Premiums in the state have spiked, with the average Florida homeowner now paying $6,000 a year. (However, those rising premiums have also brought down property values, pushing more property owners to forego coverage.)
A so-called “protection gap” seems likely to grow. Last year, insurance covered just 60 percent of the $165 billion in total economic losses from climate-related disasters in the U.S. That widening gap is becoming a major concern for federal regulators, who worry it leaves big swaths of American homeowners and businesses vulnerable to the next superstorm.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A drop in job openings may hearten the Fed. The Labor Department reported that there were 8.8 million job openings in July, the lowest level since March 2021. Economists said that would likely be interpreted as a good sign by the Fed, which will weigh new moves on interest rate policy at a meeting next month; the central bank will also factor in jobs data scheduled for release on Friday.
The White House names a first batch of drugs set for Medicare price negotiations. Officials unveiled the long-awaited list of 10 medicines, which will be subject to a landmark new program meant to reduce costs for Medicare. Drugmakers have pushed back against the plan, including in court, and Republicans have criticized the initiative as government overreach.
Military leaders seize power in oil-rich Gabon. Officers claiming to represent the major security forces of the African country said they were canceling the results of last weekend’s election, less than an hour after the incumbent president won a third term. A successful coup would mark at least the ninth military takeover in Western and Central Africa in the last three years.
CNN is expected to name its next leader imminently. Executives at Warner Bros. Discovery, the news network’s parent company, have selected Mark Thompson, a former C.E.O. of The New York Times and head of the BBC, for the post, according to The Times. The pick is meant to restore order at CNN, which has been rattled by turmoil, including the ouster of its last chief, Chris Licht.

The on-the-ground view of Raimondo’s trip to China
Wednesday was the last day of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo’s visit to China, where she has sought to promote trade between the two superpowers while holding firm on technology export limits imposed in the name of American national security.
The Times’s Ana Swanson, who covers trade and international economics and has been traveling with Raimondo, answered DealBook’s questions about the trip — while zipping along at 215 miles per hour on a train from Beijing to Shanghai.

What has the mood been like, given the current tensions between Washington and Beijing?
The atmosphere is cautious but fairly warm. It seems like both sides are pleased to be talking again, after a very rocky period for U.S.-China relations during “balloongate.” So there is somewhat of a sense of a thaw, but also recognition of how many difficult issues there are in the relationship, and that often U.S. and Chinese interests will fundamentally conflict.
How is Raimondo balancing business interests and national security during her conversations with Chinese officials?
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Raimondo has focused on promoting business ties that have nothing to do with national security — like skin care products, amusement parks and group tourism — but employed tough rhetoric about the technology controls and national security.
She didn’t talk as much about the huge number of products that fall somewhere in the middle: things like cars, steel and solar panels that are strategically important to the United States. Here, she has a more complicated mandate. Some U.S. businesses thrive on trade with China, while others are harmed or undercut by Chinese practices.

What, if anything, will this change about the U.S. relationship with China going forward?
Some are describing this as a turning point for the U.S.-China relationship. But Raimondo said on Tuesday that the direction of the relationship will depend on how much China follows through on things like improving its treatment of American companies. “Actions speak louder than words,” she said.
In other China news: The embattled homebuilder Country Garden plans to raise $34 million by selling new shares as it teeters on the brink of default. And rivals of Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination are following his lead in taking even tougher stances on trade with China.

Could Bitcoin go mainstream for investors?
Bitcoin surged as much as 7 percent on Tuesday on hopes that a favorable federal court ruling could usher in the crypto industry’s long-held dream of a new mainstream investment product tied to the cryptocurrency.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Bitcoin was trading just below $27,500 on Wednesday morning, after soaring past $28,000 on Tuesday, its highest level in two weeks. Crypto bulls bought it up after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, should be allowed to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that could eventually trade on a traditional stock market.
Image
It’s a blow to the S.E.C., which has taken a hard line on the industry and on applications for crypto investment products, especially since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX last year.
That said, the agency has approved Bitcoin-focused funds — but only those centered on futures that track price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency, starting in 2021. The agency has denied numerous requests to introduce an E.T.F. holding Bitcoin itself, arguing that the market for Bitcoin is subject to fraud and manipulation, leaving investors vulnerable.
In its ruling, the appeals court found the S.E.C.’s track record on such approvals “arbitrary and capricious.”
The crypto industry has waited a decade for this. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of the crypto exchange Gemini, first proposed such a Bitcoin fund in 2013. Since then, Wall Street stalwarts like BlackRock and Fidelity have made similar unsuccessful applications.
Grayscale’s case against the S.E.C. was closely watched by crypto executives: Approval would mean that investors could buy shares in a Bitcoin fund rather than hold the digital asset itself.

But the dream will be deferred at least a little longer. The agency has 45 days to request a review of the ruling, and an S.E.C. spokesman said it was weighing its next steps.

UBS executives had 29 billion reasons to celebrate the Swiss bank’s latest quarterly results.

The magic of “badwill”
When UBS agreed to buy its archrival, Credit Suisse, for a little over $3 billion this spring at the Swiss government’s behest, analysts and investors said that price represented a steep discount. UBS’s latest financial results reflect just how much of a steal it was.
Today, the bank reported a $29 billion profit — yes, you read that right — for the second quarter, the biggest quarterly profit in banking history. But that paper gain belies the challenges that UBS faces as it moves to complete the largest takeover of a bank since the 2008 financial crisis.
UBS’s huge profit arises from “badwill,” an accounting phenomenon where a company buys an asset for less than it’s worth, leading to a noncash gain that essentially recognizes the actual value of the asset. (It’s also known as “negative goodwill.”) UBS reported that its underlying profit for the quarter was just $1.1 billion.
Image
A wave of bank rescue deals this year has led to pumped-up profits for acquirers. Second-quarter profits at JPMorgan Chase jumped 67 percent in large part because of its takeover of First Republic, while First Citizens enjoyed a 3,500 percent gain in first-quarter profit after buying Silicon Valley Bank at a steep discount.
But UBS has more work to do, with the bank estimating that the Credit Suisse acquisition will be largely completed by 2026. Among its biggest tasks is consolidating its former rival’s domestic bank with its own, despite concerns that the move will undercut competition in Swiss retail banking.
Uniting the two will lead to some 3,000 job losses in the country, fulfilling fears among politicians and voters. But UBS defended its decision today, saying, “Our analysis clearly shows that full integration is the best outcome for UBS, our stakeholders and the Swiss economy.”
Meanwhile, Credit Suisse’s own results — including a pretax loss of 4.3 billion Swiss Francs ($4.9 billion) in the quarter, tied to customer withdrawals and struggles in investment banking — suggest that UBS still has big hurdles to overcome in absorbing the business.

For now, UBS shareholders appear happy, especially with the badwill gain showing just how much the bank benefited from rescuing its rival. (UBS manages about $5 trillion in client assets following the deal.) Shares in the bank were up over 5 percent today, at 23.42 Swiss francs ($26.57), and now trade at their highest level since the summer of 2008.

Senator Mitch McConnell freezes again in a public appearance. During a Q.&A. session with reporters in Kentucky yesterday, the top Senate Republican stopped speaking mid-answer for about 30 seconds. It was the second such incident in two months, and it renewed questions about the health of McConnell, 81, and his ability to continue serving out his term.
Donald Trump is accused of vastly overinflating his properties’ values. Attorney General Letitia James of New York said in a court filing that the former president fraudulently pumped up the value of his holdings for years, boosting his net worth by up to $2.2 billion. Lawyers for Trump said the case, one of many he faces in federal and state courts, should be dismissed.
Microsoft moves to unbundle its Teams app in Europe. The tech giant hopes that offering lower-cost versions of its productivity software packages that don’t include the communications program will assuage E.U. regulators who opened an antitrust investigation into the matter last month. Whether that will be enough is unclear: A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined to comment on whether the move satisfied regulators’ concerns.
Regulators reportedly look into benefits that Tesla gave Elon Musk. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and officials at the S.E.C. are examining perks including a spacious glass house in Texas described within the company as a house for its C.E.O., according to The Wall Street Journal. The inquiries, which appear to center on whether company-provided benefits were properly disclosed to investors, are the latest legal headache for Tesla.

What to watch in tomorrow’s jobs report
The S&P 500 is riding a four-day winning streak on hopes that the Fed is done raising interest rates. That optimistic view will be tested tomorrow morning when the Labor Department releases its nonfarm payrolls report for August.
Economists polled by Reuters estimate that employers added 170,000 jobs in August, which would be the smallest monthly increase since December 2020. But investors would likely greet a modest slowdown — along with evidence that wages are moderating — favorably.

For much of the year, markets have reacted positively to any piece of data showing that the Fed’s policy of raising its prime lending rate was cooling the red-hot labor market and, in turn, helping to lower inflation.

The labor data already released this week has cheered investors. Yesterday’s ADP private payroll report for August showed the slowest job growth in five months. That followed a Labor Department data release on Tuesday that revealed a steep drop in job openings. “The labor market is cooling and is taking pressure off policymakers concerned with a second wave of inflation,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, a research firm, wrote in a note yesterday, pointing to the ADP data.
The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady at its meeting next month. And the futures market yesterday was pricing in a 44 percent chance of the Fed raising rates at its November policy meeting — a stark drop from the 67 percent odds traders were placing at the beginning of the week. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, warned last week that central bankers do not consider their inflation fight to be over yet, making Friday’s jobs numbers pivotal.
In other labor news, the Biden administration yesterday proposed an increase in the cutoff for salaried workers who can receive overtime, making millions more workers eligible for time-and-a-half pay if they work more than 40 hours a week.
“I’ve seen all kinds of weird things with people ahead, they fall behind, they disappear. And it’s just way too early to have some conclusion that two people that the country doesn’t want are going to be the logical outcomes.”

DeSantis’s flip-flopping on federal aid
Hurricane Idalia has been downgraded to a tropical storm and is moving north after battering Florida, leaving residents counting the costs of the devastation and the insurance industry predicting billions of dollars in claims. But the storm’s impact also shines a light on the complicated relationship between Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican presidential contender, and the federal government, which typically spends big to help in such cleanups.

The Biden administration has pledged support. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has about $3.4 billion in its disaster relief fund to deal with the fallout of the Maui wildfires and Idalia. Deanne Criswell, head of the agency, told reporters yesterday that DeSantis had “no unmet needs,” before heading to Florida. President Biden said that he had called DeSantis to say he had approved an emergency declaration that the governor requested, adding, “I think he trusts my judgment and my desire to help.”
But DeSantis hasn’t always backed the spending of federal funds for disaster relief. When he was a congressman in 2013, he rejected assistance for victims of Hurricane Sandy in New York. As governor of Florida, however, he has sought aid, and during Hurricane Ian last year he paused his political feuding with Biden. DeSantis also condemned F.E.M.A. for denying a request for funds to rebuild homes after Ian.
DeSantis is already rejecting federal funds in other ways. Florida is eligible for about $350 million in green incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, but the governor has refused the money. Republican governors in South Dakota and Iowa, along with Kentucky’s Democratic governor, are turning down smaller sums.
But DeSantis’s broader rejection suggests that taking a stance on I.R.A. money could become a talking point in the race to decide the Republican presidential candidate. And that could ultimately undermine President Biden’s efforts to promote his environmental policies on the 2024 campaign trail while climate change makes emergencies like Idalia increasingly common.

2023-09-01,"In 2021, Apple was embroiled in controversy over a plan to scan iPhones for child sexual abuse materials. Privacy experts warned that governments could abuse the system, and the backlash was so severe that Apple eventually abandoned the plan.
Two years later, Apple is facing criticism from child safety crusaders and activist investors who are calling on the company to do more to protect children from online abuse.
A child advocacy group, the Heat Initiative, has raised $2 million for a new national advertising campaign calling on Apple to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse materials from iCloud, its cloud storage platform.
Next week, the group will release digital advertisements on websites popular with policymakers in Washington, such as Politico. It will also put up posters across San Francisco and New York that say: “Child sexual abuse material is stored on iCloud. Apple allows it.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The criticism speaks to a predicament that has dogged Apple for years. The company has made protecting privacy a central part of its iPhone pitch to consumers. But that promise of security has helped make its services and devices, two billion of which are in use, useful tools for sharing child sexual abuse imagery.
The company is caught between child safety groups, which want it to do more to stop the spread of such materials, and privacy experts, who want it to maintain the promise of secure devices.

A group of two dozen investors with nearly $1 trillion in assets under management have also called on Apple to publicly report the number of abusive images that it catches across its devices and services.
Two investors — Degroof Petercam, a Belgian asset manager, and Christian Brothers Investment Services, a Catholic investment firm — will submit a shareholder proposal this month that would require Apple to provide a detailed report on how effective its safety tools were at protecting children.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Apple seems stuck between privacy and action,” said Matthew Welch, an investment specialist at Degroof Petercam. “We thought a proposal would wake up management and get them to take this more seriously.”
Apple has been quick to respond to child safety advocates. In early August, its privacy executives met with the group of investors, Mr. Welch said. Then, on Thursday, the company responded to an email from the Heat Initiative with a letter that defended its decision not to scan iCloud. It shared the correspondence with Wired, a technology publication.
In Apple’s letter, Erik Neuenschwander, the director for user privacy and child safety, said the company had concluded that “it was not practically possible” to scan iCloud photos without “imperiling the security and privacy of our users.”
“Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems,” Mr. Neuenschwander said.
Apple, he added, has created a new default feature for all child accounts that intervenes with a warning if they receive or try to send nude images. It’s designed to prevent the creation of new child sexual abuse material and limit the risk of predators coercing and blackmailing children for money or nude images. It has made those tools available to app developers as well.

In 2021, Apple said it would use technology called image hashes to spot abusive material on iPhones and in iCloud.
But the company failed to communicate that plan broadly with privacy experts, intensifying their skepticism and fueling concern that governments could abuse the technology, said Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory at the Cyber Policy Center, who opposed the idea.
Last year, the company discreetly abandoned its plan to scan iCloud, catching child safety groups by surprise.
Apple has won praise from both privacy and child safety groups for its efforts to blunt the creation of new nude images on iMessage and other services. But Mr. Stamos, who applauded the company’s decision not to scan iPhones, said it could do more to stop people from sharing problematic images in the cloud.
“You can have privacy if you store something for yourself, but if you share something with someone else, you don’t get the same privacy,” Mr. Stamos said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Governments around the world are putting pressure on Apple to take action. Last year, eSafety Commissioner in Australia issued a report criticizing Apple and Microsoft for failing to do more to proactively police their services for abusive material.
In the United States, Apple made 160 reports in 2021 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally designated clearinghouse for abusive material. Google made 875,783 reports, while Facebook made 22 million. These reports do not always reflect truly abusive material; some parents have had their Google accounts suspended and have been reported to the police for images of their children that were not criminal in nature.
The Heat Initiative timed its campaign ahead of Apple’s annual iPhone unveiling, which is scheduled for Sept. 12. The campaign is being led by Sarah Gardner, who was previously the vice president for external affairs at Thorn, a nonprofit founded by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore to combat child sexual abuse online. Ms. Gardner raised money from a number of child safety supporters, including the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Oak Foundation.
The group has built a website that documents law enforcement cases where iCloud has been named. The list will include child pornography charges brought against a 55-year-old in New York who had more than 200 images stored in iCloud.
Ms. Gardner said the Heat Initiative planned to target advertising throughout the fall in areas where Apple customers and employees would encounter it. “The goal is to continue to run the tactics until Apple changes its policy,” Ms. Gardner said.

A recession seems remote, but market jitters persist
For the third time in three months, economists at Goldman Sachs have lowered the odds of a recession and now put the risk of a downturn in the United States at 15 percent. Yet despite the upbeat outlook, which follows other votes of confidence from Wall Street in recent weeks, global stocks and U.S. futures are in the red on Tuesday morning as inflation fears persist.
The strong labor market is propping up U.S. households. “Real disposable income looks set to reaccelerate in 2024 on the back of continued solid job growth and rising real wages,” Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, wrote in a client note. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that wage gains had cooled in August, but real wages, adjusted for inflation, are trending higher.
Goldman is far more bullish than others. In March, the bank raised its recession odds to 35 percent in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and worries that contagion could hurt other lenders. But fears of a bank-led downturn have all but disappeared. Still, a Bloomberg survey of economists puts the likelihood of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months at 60 percent.
Voters aren’t feeling so confident either. Poll numbers released on Monday by The Wall Street Journal showed that President Biden’s popularity is still sagging, partly because of his track record on the economy. (Voters also say he’s too old to run for re-election.) It’s the latest indication that the White House’s summer P.R. offensive, playing up the gains reaped from Bidenomics, is not resonating with Americans.

Investors aren’t feeling bullish. After last week’s rally, the S&P 500 looks set to start the week on a down note, as rising oil prices drive inflation concerns. Another potential storm cloud: Investors are questioning whether the benchmark index can hold onto its 18 percent year-to-date gains if inflation rises this autumn.
Brent crude oil hit a high for the year on Monday. Markets are bracing for the OPEC+ cartel, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, to announce this week that it will continue to pull back on production. Rising energy prices could force central banks to stay hawkish on interest rates.
On the good-news front: The futures markets see the chances of the Fed or the European Central Bank raising rates this month as increasingly unlikely.

A fight over the future of TV
As of today, 15 million Americans are still unable to watch the U.S. Open and other programming live on their TVs, thanks to a dispute between Disney and the cable giant Charter that has blacked out Disney channels like ESPN in major markets like New York City and Los Angeles.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Most of the time, so-called carriage fights get resolved quickly and quietly. But this battle could reshape the media landscape, as the two companies tussle over core issues like streaming.
The back story: Like most carriage disputes, this is about money. Disney wants to charge more for its channels, which also include FX and the Disney Channel (and, in some markets, the ABC broadcast station).
Meanwhile, Charter wants to include Disney’s streaming services — Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu — in its cable packages at essentially no charge, according to Disney. Charter says much of the programming on streaming also airs on TV; Disney counters that it also produces exclusive content for those platforms.
It’s a clash of the future versus the past. Content providers like Disney have been increasingly shifting their focuses to streaming platforms, as customers flock to watching stuff online.
But such companies are also dependent on the huge, high-margin fees that cable companies fork over to carry their traditional channels — payouts that cable providers understandably don’t want to make, especially since they’re losing subscribers to cord cutting.
ADVERTISEMENT

Charter says it’s mulling a radical move: getting out of the pay-TV business altogether. “We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on,” Chris Winfrey, the company’s C.E.O., told analysts on Friday. (Such a transformative decision is in keeping with the history of Charter’s most influential shareholder, the iconoclastic telecom mogul John Malone.)
Having Charter, America’s second-biggest cable company after Comcast, get out of pay TV could inspire others to follow suit, depriving media companies of a huge cash cow. The alternative — letting Charter offer effectively discounted access to streaming services — could lock in smaller revenue streams for content companies.
Disney has increasingly recognized the problems with relying on carriage fees, which have been shrinking; that’s why Bob Iger, its C.E.O., has publicly floated the idea of divesting its traditional TV assets. But it faces an uphill battle with Charter at a tough moment in time, as it struggles to make streaming profitable.

“China speed”
The auto industry has long been an important part of the European economy. One big reason: Some of the continent’s biggest carmakers, such as Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have built big businesses in China, the world’s largest car market. But Chinese carmakers are now turning the tables and making major inroads in Europe, leading the race for electric vehicles and sending a shiver through the continent’s manufacturers.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The shift is on display this week at the I.A.A. Mobility car show in Munich, writes The Times’s Melissa Eddy. On the first day of the event, BYD, the electric car and battery maker backed by Warren Buffett, unveiled two new vehicles. And Xpeng said it would start selling its cars in Germany next year, branching beyond Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. Also, Leapmotor announced it would bring its S.U.V. to Europe in 2024.
Europe is a crucial battleground. Gas-fueled cars are set to be banned in the E.U. in 2035, and the industry fears it is falling behind its Chinese rivals on electrics. Inovev, an auto industry consulting firm, says Chinese brands accounted for 8 percent of new E.V.s sold in Europe this year, up from 4 percent in 2021.
Chinese companies also dominate the E.V. supply chain. Lower labor costs and local battery suppliers have enabled China’s carmakers to build a big lead. CATL, the manufacturer, alone accounts for about a third of the batteries in all E.V.s sold worldwide. UBS analysts say Western car manufacturers could lose a fifth of their global market share by the end of the decade.
The continent’s carmakers face a Chinese conundrum as they play catch-up. Some executives refer to “China speed” to describe the urgency they need to compete with their lower-cost rivals. But they will ultimately face a dual threat from China that won’t end soon, Henry Sanderson, executive editor at Benchmark Mineral intelligence, an E.V. supply chain consulting firm, told DealBook. “European automakers either face exports of Chinese E.V.s or they face a Chinese battery supply chain coming to Europe that they will have to rely on,” he said.

Thursday: Investors will be parsing speeches from a trio of Fed officials — Raphael Bostic, John Williams and Patrick Harker, presidents of the Atlanta, New York and Philadelphia Feds, respectively — for clues on what the central bank will do at its meeting set for Sept. 19-20.

Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both ran for president promising to reinvigorate the economy for ordinary Americans. And both enacted laws that helped millions of people. Clinton expanded children’s health care and tax credits for low-income families. Obama accomplished even more, making it possible for almost anybody to afford health insurance.
Yet neither Obama nor Clinton managed to alter the basic trajectory of the American economy. Income and wealth inequality, which had begun rising in the early 1980s, continued to do so. So did inequality in other measures, like health and life expectancy. Polls continue to show that most Americans are frustrated with the country’s direction.

In response, a growing number of policy experts aligned with the Democratic Party have decided in recent years that their party’s approach to economic policy was flawed. They concluded that Democrats had not gone far enough to undo the revolution that Ronald Reagan started in the 1980s — a revolution that sparked the huge rise in inequality.

These Democratic experts have grown skeptical of the benefits of free trade and Washington’s hands-off approach to corporate consolidation. They want the government to spend more money on highways, technological development and other policies that could create good-paying jobs. The experts, in short, believe that they had been too accepting of the more laissez-faire economic agenda often known as neoliberalism.
This turnabout is the central explanation for President Biden’s economic agenda, which White House aides call Bidenomics and will be core to his re-election campaign. He has signed laws (sometimes with bipartisan support) spending billions of dollars on semiconductor factories, roads, bridges and clean energy. He has tried to crack down on monopolies. He has encouraged workers to join unions."

2023-09-09,"Reality and fantasy were deeply intertwined in Marvel’s Spider-Man, where gamers swung from webs above Lincoln Center and leaped from the Empire State Building’s spire into the crowds leaving the subway station at Herald Square. The comic book icon also brought his own landmarks to that version of New York City, which hosted the Avengers headquarters a few blocks north of the United Nations and a supervillain prison in the East River.
The designers at Insomniac Games are now expanding the superhero’s jurisdiction beyond Manhattan for the sequel, to be released for the PlayStation 5 on Oct. 20. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 swells into Queens and Brooklyn (including Coney Island attractions), testing a design team responsible for nearly doubling the real estate of the 2018 original.
Replicating parts of the largest city in the United States was also a bigger challenge this time because the process began while many designers at Insomniac, which has offices in Burbank, Calif., and Durham, N.C., were working from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic.
The game’s design director, Josue Benavidez, said his research involved contacting organizations like the Center for Brooklyn History, posting on Reddit groups devoted to the borough and calling businesses near the buildings he was studying.

Several open-world video games have leaned on New York’s familiar topography, including Grand Theft Auto IV and Tom Clancy’s The Division; in Assassin’s Creed III, players can scamper across an 18th-century version of the city. But New York is an inextricable part of the Spider-Man mythos, from its comic book origins — Peter Parker was born in Queens — to its movie iterations.
In the franchise’s first live-action movie, 2002’s “Spider-Man,” Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider at Columbia University, rushes to his dying Uncle Ben outside the New York Public Library at Bryant Park and rescues passengers on a Roosevelt Island tram tormented by the Green Goblin.
Insomniac, the creator of Spyro the Dragon and Ratchet & Clank, thrilled players five years ago by letting them swing their way through sights like Central Park and Times Square. The addition of Brooklyn and Queens in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 brought new design challenges that included learning the quirky geometry of brownstones and rowhouses.
Designers also wanted to vary the urban landscape, ensuring that important sites from the comics, like Aunt May’s house and Brooklyn Visions Academy, were clearly represented. Another difficulty was identifying where to end the playable area in boroughs that stretch into Long Island.

“The good news was that Spider-Man became successful,” said Bryan Intihar, who returns as the game’s senior creative director. “But with success comes greater expectations.”
In the sequel, players will control two Spider-Men as they navigate new responsibilities and powers, including the ability to jet through the skies with “web wings.” Parker and Miles Morales, who is from Brooklyn, will twist into knots over a symbiote suit that warps Parker into a villain from the comics, the alien parasite called Venom.
The drama unfolds across a landscape of construction cranes, water towers, bridges and tunnels — infrastructure that Insomniac designers studied for months.
“Everything is very intentionally placed,” Benavidez said, noting that there must be plenty of objects to show off the physics of Spider-Man’s web-slinging abilities.
One design solution was to plant more trees than you would find in the real New York City. Some changes provide sly commentary, with additional greenery and shade in the virtual Times Square and a plethora of newspaper kiosks bordering refuges like Union Square Park. Other choices skew closer to reality: Trash cans and heaps of garbage fill the city’s sidewalks.

“When there is combat, people like breaking things,” reasoned Jacinda Chew, the game’s senior art director.

Designing a believable New York takes time, and Benavidez discussed the lengthy process at the 2019 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. “We wanted the world to feel like a real place, like the actual city,” he told an audience, referring to the original game.
A digital sketch of that version of New York City included generic skyscrapers with gray facades and black windows dotting the horizon. Developers then used their visual research — culled from online images and field photographs — to define the scale of the city and breathe life into its avenues.
Once designers had enough information, they began creating versions of the high-rises and brownstones that characterize a city block. Many of those designs were then fed into a procedural generation software called Houdini, which helps eliminate tedious tasks like placing individual street lamps.
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 was built specifically for the more powerful PlayStation 5, which allowed Chew’s team to design buildings with greater depth. Spider-Man may see more than his reflection when he scales a skyscraper, with some windows that peer into office cubicles and living rooms.
Depicting a famous city, however, takes more than meticulous renderings. Although the Chrysler Building appears in the 2018 Spider-Man game, it is missing in a 2020 spinoff, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, because Insomniac could not reach a copyright agreement with the building’s new owners. The studio says the skyscraper will also be absent in October’s sequel.

Expectations are high for Spider-Man 2, which may be the biggest PlayStation exclusive of the year. Insomniac said last year that the original Spider-Man and the Miles Morales spinoff had sold a combined 33 million copies.
A spokeswoman for the studio declined to address the budget or size of the development team for Spider-Man 2, but making high-fidelity games of that size can require hundreds of millions of dollars. Documents from the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against the Microsoft-Activision merger included an accidental disclosure of budget data from Sony, the publisher of the Spider-Man games, revealing that other popular titles like The Last of Us Part II and Horizon Forbidden West cost upward of $200 million each.
Market analysts say major studios have relied on established intellectual property to mitigate their risk. But characters with established followings in action movies and comic books do not necessarily have the same appeal in video games.
Over the summer, Axios examined recent entries in the genre, including Gotham Knights and Marvel’s Avengers, that sold poorly and drew negative reviews. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, by the studio behind the successful Batman: Arkham games, has been repeatedly delayed and mired in staff departures.
“Spider-Man fans will at least give it a fair trial,” said Andre James, global head of media and entertainment practice for the consulting firm Bain & Company. “But the world of possibilities that tech has enabled may need a lot of time and iteration to get right.”

The team behind the Spider-Man sequel believes it has already found a winning formula, one that whisks players into the superhero’s universe by adding a touch of realism and a sucker punch of New York attitude.
“What we have tried to focus on,” Intihar, the game’s creative director, said, “is respecting the DNA of the franchise without being afraid of mixing things up.”"
2023-09-10,"Mustafa Suleyman is one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence entrepreneurs, having co-founded not one but two start-ups at the cutting edge of the most transformative technology since the internet.
Mr. Suleyman, 39, is C.E.O. of Inflection AI, the company he started last year with Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn. In June, the firm closed a $1.3 billion funding round that included Microsoft and Nvidia, the leading A.I. chip maker, and that reportedly valued the company at about $4 billion. (Its chatbot, Pi, is designed to be a personal digital companion.)
Mr. Suleyman also co-founded DeepMind, an A.I. pioneer that Google acquired in 2014. He left Google early last year and joined Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm, where Hoffman is also a partner.
Now he has written a book, “The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the 21st Century’s Greatest Dilemma,” that calls for an urgent shift in how we think about and “contain” A.I. Failing to do so, he says, will leave us humans in the worst position: unable to tap into the huge opportunities of A.I. and at risk of being subsumed by a technology that poses an existential threat.
Mr. Suleyman wants governments to regulate A.I. and appoint cabinet-level tech ministers, and says the United States should use its dominance in advanced chips to enforce global standards. He has also called for the creation of a governance regime modeled on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to make the work of private companies in A.I. more transparent.
Such agreements may be difficult to achieve at a time of growing global tensions, but they are timely as lawmakers unveil proposals about how A.I. should be overseen.

Morocco’s quake toll climbs as aid trickles in
As the death toll from the earthquake rose to at least 2,862 and many settlements waited desperately for help, a senior Moroccan official insisted that the authorities had promptly addressed the disaster amid public criticism over the pace of aid.
Government rescue workers began to reach some devastated mountain villages yesterday, three days after the country was hit by the strongest earthquake in the area in more than a century. Many were without power and phone service, fueling criticism on social media of the government’s response.
In the town of Amizmiz, at the foot of the High Atlas Mountains in Al Haouz province, more ambulances and uniformed emergency personnel were on the streets than on Sunday, and more survivors appeared to be sheltering in disaster relief tents than in makeshift structures.
In some villages where the homes are made of mud bricks, as many as half of the houses were flattened. With official aid slow to arrive and the government offering little information about rescue efforts, many Moroccan citizens have stepped in to fill in the gaps themselves. Some residents, desperate for basic supplies, said that they felt abandoned.

2023-09-12,"Jake Dunlap texts his wife. He texts his pickleball group chat. And in the past five years, he has started texting his co-workers.
Mr. Dunlap, 43, the chief executive of a consulting company in Austin, Texas, has asked colleagues not to overdo it on the work texts. Yes, they get his attention quickly, and yes, they’re an effective way to reach him after hours. But he is concerned that each buzz erodes the digital boundary between work and everything else. “Text is kind of the final frontier of personal space,” he said.
Brace your thumbs for the era of the work text: The blue bubble has put on its best business-casual and joined email and Slack in the sprawling digital workplace.
Its arrival has been polarizing. Fans of the work text consider it productive, even collegial; to detractors, it’s outright invasive. The medium is loved and feared for its immediacy, and the way that it invites co-workers into something like the inner sanctum of our digital lives.
ADVERTISEMENT

Until fairly recently, text was the most intimate of our inboxes, home to friends and family and the occasional “U up?” (“Sext” didn’t become well-worn slang for nothing.) That inbox has been breached by a surge of advertisers, spam, messages from political campaigns and — least sexy of all — six-digit verification codes.
Work may be among its most determined invaders. More than 40 percent of workers use text messaging on their personal phones to communicate for work purposes, according to the economic research organization WFH Research, which surveyed more than 6,000 Americans in May.
Nick Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford who worked on the study, said that the pandemic may be to thank. As many employees worked from home, companies relied on layers of digital communication software to keep them in touch: Zoom on top of email on top of Microsoft Teams on top of Slack. The result was a series of noisy digital inboxes all competing for workers’ attention.
Texting, which we use to maintain our closest social bonds, was a reliable way to cut through. Ninety-seven percent of text messages are opened within 15 minutes, according to a report from Insider Intelligence, a research firm. “I may interrupt a meeting if I have a text, because my kids text,” Dr. Bloom said. “I would never interrupt a meeting for an email.”
Getting personal
Texting has grown in importance since the first SMS, or short messaging service, greeting was sent by a 22-year-old engineer in 1992. In 2010 it overtook the phone call as the preferred method of communication between teenagers and their friends.

Those teenagers have aged into a professional generation more reliant on texting. Ashlyn Shadden was a high schooler in the early 2000s when she got her first cellphone, a pink Nokia that she mostly used to text her boyfriend. Ms. Shadden, 34, who now runs a clothing boutique in St. Jo, Texas, said she had noticed that a lot of other people around her age prefer to do business over text.
Ms. Shadden was once texting a vendor about restocking some clothing items when she got a picture of the vendor’s dog, with an explanation that the dog would soon be put down.
“I’ve never met her, and she’s never met me,” she said. “When you are texting with someone just businesswise, it still has the possibility of that getting a little more personal.”
Matt Wheatley, 32, who lives in Manhattan and works at a legal-tech company, is a fan of the work text because it allows him to build a quicker, looser rapport with his business contacts. His texts to them are peppered with “hahaha,” “lol” and emojis. “The little fire emoji is pretty work-safe,” he said.
‘So awkward omg’
Work texts can easily veer into uncomfortable or invasive territory.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more clients have asked Lauren Young Durbin, a career coach in Richmond, Va., how to keep their co-workers from texting them too much. Workers give out their personal phone numbers in an effort to seem friendly and accessible, she said, then come to regret it once they realize the nozzle cannot be turned off.
Gabrielle Blackwell, 32, who works in sales for a software company in Austin, tries to keep business conversations confined to work-specific channels like Slack and email.

Ms. Blackwell had first been flattered when a boss at a previous job had wanted to communicate with her via text. She soon discovered her supervisor had “no boundaries” and would text her for input incessantly, with questions beyond her job description. “Once they had my number, they felt like they could reach out to me any time,” she said. “That was a very unhealthy situation.”
Others text in an effort to avoid monitoring by employers, which often use productivity-monitoring software to keep tabs on what their workers are saying. Although companies cannot access text messages as easily as emails or Slack messages, Ms. Young Durbin reminds clients that text messages can be made public — with major career consequences.
She pointed to Tucker Carlson, who parted ways with Fox News not long after some of his private texts were released in a legal filing. Elizabeth Holmes, Anthony Weiner and Tom Brady are among those whose text messages have been made public, with legal or reputational repercussions.
All the workers interviewed for this article offered their own suggestions for preventing work from overwhelming their text inboxes, and by extension, their lives. Mr. Dunlap tries to respond only to time-sensitive text messages from co-workers. Ms. Young Durbin tells clients to establish “texting hours” when they give out their phone numbers. Ms. Shadden has thought about getting a second phone to be used just for work.
Dr. Bloom emphasized that just because you can reply to a work text at any time of the day or night does not mean that you should. “Imagine you’ve had two or three glasses of wine,” he said. If you flub a response to your boss while inebriated, he said, “you’re in trouble.”
Those suggestions might help some workers fortify their inboxes. They also might be Band-Aids for the larger issue of work’s overreach into our personal lives, said Anne Helen Petersen, the writer of the newsletter Culture Study and an author of “Out of Office: The Big Problem and Bigger Promise of Working From Home.”

Email and Slack once dangled the possibility of seamless connection before workers, only to end up tethering them more closely to ever-present digital desks, she said. By giving us the illusion that we can work and relax simultaneously on a trip to the gym or a midafternoon walk, text, too, might be further entangling our work and personal lives. “The fact that there is no mode of communication that is immune from work is a testament to the fact that work is so central in American life,” she said.
Even Ms. Petersen, who has spent much of her career examining the swelling of the workplace, has not been spared. This summer she read aloud a text she had just gotten from a producer of her podcast, explaining a small mix-up: “I feel so awkward omg.”"
2023-09-13,"The California Legislature this week passed a landmark bill that would require major companies to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, a move with national and global repercussions in governments’ efforts to fight climate change.
A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, declined on Wednesday to say whether he would sign the bill.
If enacted, about 5,000 companies that do business in California would be compelled to report the amount of greenhouse gas pollution that is directly emitted by their operations, and also indirect emissions from things like employee travel, waste disposal and supply chains.
The law would apply to public and private businesses that make more than $1 billion annually and operate in California. But because it is the world’s fifth-largest economy, California often sets the trend for the nation.
Many of the affected businesses would include oil and gas giants like Chevron, major financial institutions like Wells Fargo and global brands like Apple. The companies would be required to disclose all their emissions starting in 2027.
The California legislation goes beyond a measure proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would require only publicly-traded companies to disclose their emissions. That proposal, which has yet to be finalized, is facing strong opposition from conservatives and business groups."

Masa Son, the SoftBank founder, is hoping for an auspicious trading debut for Arm, the chip design firm his company owns.

Arm is ready to make its market debut
All eyes are on Arm Thursday as the chip designer prepares to begin trading on the Nasdaq in the biggest initial public offering of the year. The company priced its shares on Wendesday at $51 each, the top end of its range, valuing it at about $54.5 billion.
A lot is riding on Arm’s debut: Success may help revive a moribund market for I.P.O.s, as well as the fortunes of the company’s parent, the Japanese tech giant SoftBank, which is looking for a win after a string of disappointing investments.
Arm’s I.P.O. is big, but some had hoped for more. SoftBank had initially wished the company would be valued at as much as $70 billion. (Earlier this year, it had appraised Arm at $64 billion.) And it had pitched Arm as a major player in designing chips for artificial intelligence applications, a tech sector that investors have flocked to.
But valuations of privately held companies have fallen sharply over the past year, and investors were reportedly concerned about Arm’s so-so financial performance of late.

Still, the deal is probably a win for SoftBank. The $54.5 billion valuation is significantly higher than the $32 billion that it paid for Arm in 2016. And a richer appraisal could help SoftBank, which could then borrow more against its remaining stake in the company to raise more cash for investments.
SoftBank played it safe in taking Arm public, rather than taking the sort of grand risks it has long been known for: It sold about 10 percent of the company’s shares in the I.P.O., and its founder, Masa Son, reportedly favored pricing the deal at $51 a share, despite some underwriters suggesting going to $52 apiece.
What comes next? Wall Street has hoped that a successful Arm debut could restore investor confidence in I.P.O.s, jump-starting a market that has been largely flat over the past year. (That said, the offerings for younger, smaller companies, like Instacart and the marketing software provider Klaviyo, may be better indications of the health of the I.P.O. business.)
SoftBank also hopes that investors will regard the chip designer as a key part of the A.I. revolution, giving it the kind of runaway valuation lift Nvidia enjoys. But Arm is best known for making the low-power chips used in smartphones, a market that’s now stagnating, and it has only in recent years started making inroads into A.I.-focused data centers.

The Fed’s higher-for-longer inflation problem
The markets this morning were nudging up the odds that the central bank will be forced to raise interest rates again this year after Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index report showed that inflation was running higher than expected.
Here are a few takeaways from the latest C.P.I. data:
The inflation outlook: higher for longer. Both the “headline” and “core” inflation readings, which strip out fuel and food costs, were above economists’ forecasts.  Inflation is decelerating, but Wall Street analysts now see it remaining well above the Fed’s 2 percent target until late 2024.
Keep an eye on energy prices. Gasoline prices spiked, jumping 10.6 percent on a monthly basis. Crude oil prices are rising this morning, trading at around a 10-month high. High fuel prices have a multiplier effect on how companies set prices, which could explain why airfares have rebounded, rising nearly 5 percent last month compared with the July figure.
Economists still expect the Fed to hold tight on rates next week. But according to the CME FedWatch indicator, the futures market now gives a 39 percent chance of the central bank raising borrowing costs at its December meeting.

Lazard’s new chief sets out his plan
As Peter Orszag prepares to take the reins of Lazard on Oct. 1, the Democratic economist turned banker is laying out his priorities for the 175-year-old investment bank, including stepped-up recruiting and improving the company’s stock performance.
That’s all in service of ambitious goals, he told DealBook, including a doubling of revenue by 2030 and maintaining Lazard’s reputation as a top adviser to C.E.O.s and governments.
Lazard needs to grow in revenue, returns and relevance, Orszag wrote in an internal memo reviewed by DealBook. Doing that will mean winning more banking mandates, expanding the firm’s asset-management business (perhaps through acquisitions) and improving total shareholder returns to an average of 10 percent to 15 percent, in line with competitors.
It also means recruiting more bankers — a task that Orszag said improving perceptions about Lazard as a place to work could help with. “In some settings, fairly or unfairly, Lazard’s reputation lags,” he said.
The firm should benefit from improving conditions for investment banking. Orszag said that tailwinds for the business were improving as interest-rate rises by the Fed appear to be slowing and markets pick up. Also providing relief were signs that the Biden administration may back off slightly from aggressive antitrust enforcement, he said, after a setback in fighting Microsoft’s $70 billion takeover bid for Activision Blizzard.

But Orszag cautioned that all of this won’t translate into an immediate boost to business, because it will take time for new M.&A. talks to flower into completed deals.
Orszag predicted that Lazard would remain public for some time to come, despite a move by a rival bank, Rothschild, to go private and reports that his own firm had explored a similar move with an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund.
Though the firm’s stock price has underperformed the wider market, he argued that Lazard’s pool of talent and business opportunities were a good foundation for better days ahead. “We’re a public company and have a lot of growth potential,” he said.

Bernard Arnault, 74, the C.E.O. of LVMH, is waving off succession questions.

Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times
Who will succeed Bernard Arnault?
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire behind LVMH, has ridden a decades-long global luxury boom to turn his holding group into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
But who will succeed Arnault, 74, is a question hanging over the group. He has given no indication that he is preparing to step back and even persuaded the board last year to raise the mandatory retirement age for C.E.O. and chairman to 80, from 75.
Still, a leading theory is that one or more of Arnault’s five children, each of whom holds an executive role at LVMH, are next in line.
The Times’s Liz Alderman and Vanessa Friedman spoke to Arnault and his children and report on what to expect next from the family.
“The best person inside the family or outside the family should be one day my successor,” Mr. Arnault continued. “But it’s not something that I hope is a duel for the near future.”
Still, legacy is clearly on Mr. Arnault’s mind. He grew up in Roubaix, once a booming textile center in northern France, and watched family industrial dynasties collapse as children or grandchildren took their eyes off the business or squandered inheritances.
“After one or two generations, it broke down because they had it too easy,” he said. It was a mistake he vowed not to make with his own children. “I didn’t want them to start going to big parties,” Mr. Arnault said. “I made them work.”
Assessing the China risk
Lawmakers on both sides of the House are calling for more limits on U.S. capital flows to China after President Biden signed an executive order last month banning investments in some high-tech sectors. But a House committee’s trip to Wall Street this week highlighted the challenges of disentangling financial links.
ADVERTISEMENT

“More can be done,” Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said on Wednesday at a hearing. She called on the Biden administration to review passive investing in Chinese companies through mutual funds and indexes, and wants more scrutiny of Chinese investments by private equity and venture capital firms.
Another area of concern: a potential invasion of Taiwan. Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin, who heads a committee on competition with China, told DealBook that he “totally disagrees” with Biden’s assessment that China’s economic woes lessen the chances of an invasion. Taiwan is self-governed but China claims sovereignty over the territory and has threatened to take it by force.
His committee held a wargame-like exercise to demonstrate the potential effect on supply chains and the financial system, and Gallagher said an invasion would be a huge upheaval for the “U.S. economy and banking system.”
Congress is being urged to act. Jay Clayton, the former S.E.C. chair who spoke to the committee, said that there should be more scrutiny of and restrictions on outbound investments. Asking companies to make “shades of gray” distinctions about national security and human rights is unrealistic, he added, but Wall Street would respond quickly to government signals.

2023-09-16,"The United Automobile Workers strike is in its second day, and already it’s being framed as potentially the most costly of work stoppages from the “summer of strikes.”
Unions aren’t just fighting for an inflation-beating wage boost. They also are campaigning for job security at a time when workers increasingly fear that shifts to new technologies, like electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, threaten their job, and tech bosses themselves say this gloomy outlook is inevitable.
Union leaders had a seat at the table this week in Washington at an A.I. forum organized by Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, and attended by tech leaders, such as Elon Musk, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Jensen Huang of Nvidia. Their presence signals their growing clout in discussions about the future of the technology.
Concern over disruptive technologies are seen on the picket lines. The Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, fear studios are embracing A.I. tools to generate scripts or copy the performances of actors. “If we don’t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in trouble,” Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, warned in July. “We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines.”

The U.A.W., meanwhile, is concerned that the industry’s shift to electric vehicles will require fewer workers, and that many of the jobs needed will be in battery factories, most of which are not unionized.
Giving workers a voice in the use of technology has taken on new urgency, said Thomas Kochan, an emeritus professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, who has been studying the future of work since the 1980s: “Generative A.I. in particular has just exploded on the scene in a way that’s going to make this one of the most controversial and one of the most important workplace issues of our time.”
The clock is ticking. It’s strategic for unions to get involved early. Otherwise, companies can say, “We’re already using the technology; we’re not really interested in your ideas about how we could be better using it,” said Adam Seth Litwin, an associate professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University.
Companies aren’t legally obligated to negotiate with unions over early-stage decisions on how new technologies are used. Unions “only have a right to negotiate over the impacts of technology on wages, hours and working conditions,” Kochan said. The thornier issue of what and how technology is deployed, he said, is “the frontier of collective bargaining today.”
One breakthrough for labor came in 2018, when Marriott Hotel workers went on strike at 49 locations. After a six-week stoppage, the company agreed to give the union notice before introducing technologies that would affect workers’ jobs and the right to discuss the changes with management.

Why would companies benefit from worker input? “If technologies are not developed with the user in mind, they often fail,” said Lisa Kresge, a research and policy associate at the University of California Berkeley Labor Center, who has written about union responses to technology. Take those Marriott workers: At the time, they said a new housekeeping app sent them inefficiently bouncing between floors when they could have worked faster by cleaning rooms clustered together.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
“If the only option that the labor movement places on the table is ‘No, we don’t want the technology that will hurt our workers,’ that will not be enough,” said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. and a co-author of “Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle Over Technology & Prosperity.” The key, he said, is for labor to articulate how the technologies can be used “to the great benefit of the workers as well as the businesses.” That’s “what’s missing right now” in the labor negotiations, Acemoglu added.
Federal proposals to regulate A.I. — in relation to work or otherwise — are barely underway. That leaves the unions, which represent only about 6 percent of the private sector work force, fighting a lonely battle. “If your company is automating and you want a voice in that process, and you are not unionized,” Acemoglu said, “then there is not much you can do.” — Sarah Kessler

Natural assets
After a summer filled with catastrophic floods, blistering heat domes and devastating wildfires, government and business leaders from around the world are set to discuss efforts to mitigate climate change at the United Nations Climate Ambition Summit in New York on Wednesday.
The usual topics are on the agenda, including net-zero targets, energy transition plans and renewable energy targets.

But these solutions may be missing something fundamental, according to Partha Dasgupta, an economist at the University of Cambridge. In a 2021 report commissioned by the British government, Dasgupta made the case for shifting how natural resources are valued, and the idea has since gained momentum: Last month, the White House released a draft proposal on what should be considered in a cost-benefit analysis when it comes to ecosystem services in government, practices that draw on his work.
DealBook spoke with Dasgupta about updating economics to account for nature.
Traditional economics does not account for the value Earth provides, Dasgupta said, but instead assumes that ecosystems are self-regenerating and able to offer services indefinitely and that there will be an infinite supply of materials. His report included what he calls an “important new set of calculations” for treating natural resources like the ocean and functions, like pollination, as assets, which, theoretically, increase the chances that we invest in and manage our ecosystems to allow for the production of more goods. “Asset management is a very well understood phenomenon,” Dasgupta said. “But for a variety of reasons, Mother Nature’s assets don’t carry the signals we need to manage them adequately.”
How this idea is applied will vary from place to place, Dasgupta said, but now there is a vocabulary and method for addressing the underlying issues. The Biden proposal, for example, cites “failing to fully account for nature’s bounty” as having led to an “erosion of our nation’s natural assets.” Dasgupta called the proposal “a fine piece of work,” but he said that he wasn’t confident it would be put into effect, or that his ideas more broadly would be understood fast enough to prevent disaster. “We’re in a firefighting situation,” he said. “Extreme weather events are happening even as we speak.”
Dasgupta worries that an important nuance within his work gets lost, even as it becomes more well known. The services of nature are interconnected, and “they can be brought down like a house of cards,” he said. “You remove one card from the house and the whole house collapses.” So climate change solutions that focus on goods and tech, like replacing oil with solar power, fail to account for the full picture — the interconnectedness of everything.
Policymakers often assume that a few tweaks and some human ingenuity will allow for infinite goods and growth; Dasgupta does not.

On our radar: ‘Dumb Money’
Remember the meme-stock craze of 2021? The sudden jump in shares of the video game retailer GameStop, driven by Reddit-fueled day traders, rattled financial titans — especially the hedge fund moguls who had bet against the company’s stock price. It was seen briefly as a moment of Main Street’s beating Wall Street at its own game.
That heady time is chronicled in “Dumb Money,” an exuberant comedy that aims to do for GameStop what “The Big Short” did for the 2008 global financial crisis. Out now in limited release, the movie features a cast of big-name actors, including Paul Dano, America Ferrera and Seth Rogen, playing a mix of real-life characters and fictional composites who feature on both sides of the trading conflict.

“Dumb Money” is connected to Wall Street behind the scenes, too: The film was financed and produced by Teddy Schwarzman, son of the Blackstone co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman, and written by two former Wall Street Journal reporters, Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo. But it’s not exactly sympathetic to the hedge fund side of the story — to the point that Ken Griffin of Citadel has reportedly threatened to sue over his portrayal.
Alison Willmore of Vulture wrote in a review that “the pleasant surprise of ‘Dumb Money’ is that it’s such an effective entertainment.” The New York Times’s Ben Kenigsberg described the film as “an energetic, ingratiating dramatization” but the “humanizing efforts are less inspired.”

2023-09-17,"As China’s spy balloon drifted across the continental United States in February, American intelligence agencies learned that President Xi Jinping of China had become enraged with senior Chinese military generals.
The spy agencies had been trying to understand what Mr. Xi knew and what actions he would take as the balloon, originally aimed at U.S. military bases in Guam and Hawaii, was blown off course.
Mr. Xi was not opposed to risky spying operations against the United States, but American intelligence agencies concluded that the People’s Liberation Army had kept Mr. Xi in the dark until the balloon was over the United States.
American officials would not discuss how spy agencies gleaned this information. But in details reported here for the first time, they discovered that when Mr. Xi learned of the balloon’s trajectory and realized it was derailing planned talks with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, he berated senior generals for failing to tell him that the balloon had gone astray, according to American officials briefed on the intelligence.
The episode threw a spotlight on the expanding and highly secretive spy-versus-spy contest between the United States and China. The balloon crisis, a small part of a much larger Chinese espionage effort, reflects a brazen new aggressiveness by Beijing in gathering intelligence on the United States as well as Washington’s growing capabilities to collect its own information on China.
For Washington, the espionage efforts are a critical part of President Biden’s strategy to constrain the military and technological rise of China, in line with his thinking that the country poses the greatest long-term challenge to American power.

A summer of strikes is set to stretch on
The U.A.W.’s strike against the big three Detroit carmakers appears unlikely to end soon, with the two sides giving little sign that either will bend significantly.
It’s the latest signal of organized labor’s resurgent combativeness across the nation from Detroit to Hollywood, including a willingness to head to the picket line. Fueling that confidence is strong support from Americans, the White House and even some Republicans.
The U.A.W. is prepared to play hardball for a while, as it pursues demands like a 40 percent pay increase over four years, shorter workweeks and an end to a tiered wage system. Its president, Shawn Fain, on Sunday rejected a proposal by Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, to raise pay 21 percent over four years.
A big help is the union’s novel strategy of targeting all three Detroit automakers — Ford, General Motors and Stellantis — at once, instead of taking them on indivudually, as well as striking just a few key factories at a time. The plan isn’t without risk, since it requires more coordination among U.A.W. workers, but experts say it gives the union more leverage and preserves its strike fund for longer.

Other unions are digging in as well. The Writers Guild of America is in the fourth month of its strike against major Hollywood studios, while the actors’ union, known as SAG-AFTRA, is in its second. The W.G.A. is scheduled to resume talks with studios this week, but in the meantime it is continuing to put pressure on productions that are seeking to return to work: Drew Barrymore reversed her decision to bring back her daytime talk show after criticism from the union and allies.
Organized labor is enjoying high levels of support. More strikes are taking place in the U.S. now than at any time in more than two decades: 4.1 million workdays were lost to stoppages last month, according to the Labor Department, the most since 2000. A Gallup poll published in August found that 67 percent of Americans approve of unions, the fifth straight year such support has exceeded the long-term polling average of 62 percent.
The U.A.W. also has an ally in President Biden, who has pitched himself and his economic policies as pro-labor. Still, some Republicans are trying to make hay from the strike — but unlike in years past, they’re seeking to curry favor with union workers. That’s a change in strategy that started with Donald Trump in 2016, which he has taken up again in his 2024 presidential run.
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A new Republican effort to avoid a government shutdown appears doomed. Shortly after Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California presented a plan on Sunday that would slash federal spending — an effort to bridge the moderate and hard-right wings of his caucus — some lawmakers in his party rejected the proposal. Time is running out for Congress to reach a compromise to keep the government running past Oct. 1.
U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Malta ahead of a potential Biden-Xi summit. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, held two days of talks with Wang Yi, Beijing’s foreign minister, on issues including the war in Ukraine and tensions over Taiwan. The confab is part of an effort to lay groundwork for a meeting between President Biden and President Xi Jinping in San Francisco in November.

Home buyers are feeling the squeeze
A new batch of real estate data will be released this week, starting with a closely watched gauge on housing affordability out today that is expected to show little relief for home buyers.
A lack of housing supply and soaring borrowing costs are pricing many aspiring buyers out of the market. Mortgages rates have hit a two-decade high recently, and many economists expect the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate again in the coming months.

Wall Street is having an impact, too. The Times’s Ronda Kaysen and Ella Koeze report from Bradfield Farms, a subdivision in Charlotte, N.C., where large investors have swooped in over the past two years to buy up hundreds of single-family homes and convert them into rentals. Paying in cash, the investors were able to outbid prospective buyers looking for a starter home, quickly transforming the neighborhood.

A similar trend was found in middle-income neighborhoods, often home to large Black and Latino populations, in other Sun Belt cities. Wall Street investors tend to bundle their properties into a portfolio that attracts other investors looking for stable returns, such as mutual funds and pension funds.
Affordable housing advocates and lawmakers are warning about the rise of the practice. “They’re shutting people out of the home-buying process,” Madeline Bankson, a housing research coordinator at the nonprofit Private Equity Stakeholder Project, told The Times.
In the past year, Senate and House Democrats have introduced bills, including the Stop Predatory Investing Act, to limit the practice of Wall Street landlords buying up homes, but their efforts have gained little traction.

M.&A. success is a coin toss
The hit rate on mergers and acquisitions has long been questioned. Business school professors often teach that such deals are a long shot, and investors worry that advisers more often come out in better shape than the companies.
But new research suggests the success rate is closer to a coin toss, and there are things buyers can do to improve the chances of winning, The Wall Street Journal reports.
Serial acquirers do better than average. Shares in companies doing deals worth $100 million or more on average have beaten their peers’ 53 percent of the time since the global financial crisis, according to Naaguesh Appadu, a senior research fellow at the Bayes Business School of City, University of London.
That may be because they have developed a playbook for how to do deals well. Retaining employees from the acquired company, and appointing the strongest to executive positions, is one good practice.
Monitoring investors’ initial reaction could also offer a gauge for success, says Mark Sirower, an M.&A. adviser at Deloitte Consulting:
His data shows 57% of stocks that started off with a positive performance around the deal announcement stayed ahead a year out, while almost two-thirds of the stocks that initially fell remained lower 12 months later.
Overall, Sirower said his data showed odds of a sizable deal succeeding were “slightly less than a coin flip.” His research shows that between 1995 and 2018, buyers’ stock lagged behind peers 56% of the time in the year after a deal announcement.

2023-09-20,"This article is part of our special section on the Climate Forward event that will include policy and climate leaders from around the world.
On any given day, there is good reason to be both exceedingly optimistic about the progress being made to combat climate change, and also deeply concerned about the threats presented by a rapidly warming planet.
Take a single Wednesday last month: Aug. 16. On that day, the White House celebrated the first anniversary of the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. President Biden’s signature climate legislation is providing hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize the build-out of clean energy around the country, turbocharging efforts to shift the economy away from planet-warming fossil fuels.
At the very same time, however, a flurry of extreme weather events were battering the globe. Hurricane Hilary, which would go on to lash Southern California as a rare tropical storm, formed in the Pacific Ocean. Portland and other cities in the Northwest United States were sizzling under an unusual heat wave. And Japan was cleaning up from a destructive typhoon.

On the one hand, a new green revolution is genuinely underway, with trillions of dollars being spent to reduce planet-warming emissions. On the other hand, the destructive effects of climate change are now squarely upon us, and poised to get worse, scientists predict.
“The basis for both the hope and the fear has increased,” Al Gore, the former vice president, said in an interview. “That may sound like a paradox, but I’ve never been more hopeful that we are going to solve this crisis, and there’s never been clearer evidence of how rapidly this crisis is getting much worse, faster than expected.”
It’s this tension — between progress and inertia, between a sustainable future and an untenable status quo — that will animate a full day of live journalism at The New York Times Climate Forward event on Thursday.
Timed to coincide with the United Nations General Assembly session in New York City, the event will feature conversations with Mr. Gore; Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store of Norway; President William Ruto of Kenya; Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft and the founder of Breakthrough Energy; the tidying-up expert and author Marie Kondo; the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy; and many other climate leaders.

In Europe and the United States, a growing percentage of electricity is being generated with wind turbines and solar power, and more electric vehicles are taking to the road. Yet across much of the rest of the world, new coal plants are still being built, and a growing middle class is consuming more plastics, fuels and meat.
So-called climate deniers — some industry leaders, influential politicians and members of the general public — are skeptical of the science and often equally opposed to the proposed solutions, and some fossil fuel companies continue to block efforts to reduce emissions.

And while world leaders pledged to try and keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels at the United Nations climate summit in Paris in 2015, that goal looks unachievable today.
Against this backdrop, calls to phase out the use of coal, gas and oil are growing more urgent than ever before.

“With a growing global population, energy demands are only going up, and fossil fuels are absolutely not the answer to this increased demand,” said Ms. McCarthy, the former E.P.A. administrator. “We need to install more wind, solar and other existing clean energy solutions that are now cheaper and healthier than fossil fuels.”
António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, has grown impassioned in his calls to phase out fossil fuels and draw down greenhouse gas emissions. “The era of global warming has ended,” he said recently. “The era of global boiling has arrived.”
Activists are disrupting sporting events, shutting down highways and taking to the streets. And young people are increasingly engaged, bringing lawsuits and challenging politicians and corporate interests.
“It definitely is a David versus Goliath fight,” Nalleli Cobo, a young activist from Los Angeles who grew up near an active oil well and developed cancer at age 19, said during the March to End Fossil Fuels in New York. “But as a person of faith, I’m very happy to be David in this fight. It’s a reminder of the collective power that we have.”
And business leaders and philanthropists are increasingly engaged. Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, has made climate action a core part of his charitable strategy and is spending more than $1 billion on efforts to shut down coal, gas and petrochemical plants.

It will take trillions of dollars, not just billions, however, to build out clean energy infrastructure around the world, while at the same time adapting to a hotter planet.
There is tentative hope that proposed reforms to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund could help unlock some of that capital, sending it to developing countries — especially in Africa, which has 60 percent of the world’s solar energy potential and almost a third of the minerals that will be needed to electrify transportation and the power grid.
“If you think about the attributes and the assets that we’re going to need in order to survive and thrive this century, Africa is uniquely well endowed,” said James Irungu Mwangi, a Kenyan entrepreneur who helped organize the recent Africa Climate Summit. “Investing in Africa and climate positive growth is one of the best chances the world has of getting anywhere close to the Paris goals.”
But more than money, what is needed, climate advocates say, is a wholesale reimagining of the world and our place in it.
“The single biggest obstacle to having a meaningful effect on climate change is the narrative that nature and humanity are disconnected or separate,” said the Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., president and chief executive of the Hip-Hop Caucus, an advocacy group working to stop the expansion of fossil fuels.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Yearwood said that as climate disasters multiply, there is a growing need for people across the world to recognize that this is the only planet we have. “We must begin to center the human impact of climate change,” he said, “and understand how it intersects with all aspects of our daily lives.”
Only then, he said, will we have a chance of solving what may be the greatest collective action problem in human history."

Google will put its Bard chatbot in Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube and more.

Jason Henry for The New York Times
The race to bring A.I. to the masses heats up
Months after OpenAI’s ChatGPT seized the world’s imagination and spurred a global debate about how to regulate artificial intelligence, use of the chatbot has dropped sharply. (Though that may just be tied to students having been on summer vacation.)
Still, rivals are betting heavily on A.I. and a flurry of announcements by tech giants this week shows how they’re racing to dominate one of the most transformative technologies in decades.
Google is putting its Bard chatbot in Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube and more, hoping that tying its technology to some of the world’s most popular tech services will speed its adoption. Though the company was a pioneer in A.I. research, it is now under pressure to catch up to rivals like OpenAI, with Bard trailing ChatGPT in usage.
But The Times’s Kevin Roose found that the newly revamped Bard is “a bit of a mess,” with the chatbot inaccurately summing up emails and inventing facts (a phenomenon known as hallucinating). “We know it’s not perfect,” Jack Krawczyk, the head of Bard, told Kevin.

Amazon is using A.I. to make Alexa smarter. The company is applying the latest tech to its voice assistant, which it says will allow Alexa to understand more conversational phrases and handle multiple requests. (For instance: Instead of specifically telling Alexa to activate a connected thermostat, users will soon be able to simply say, “Alexa, I’m cold,” Dave Limp, Amazon’s head of devices and services, told The Verge.)
While Alexa helped ignite interest in “smart” assistants a decade ago, it hasn’t advanced much since then, particularly in user request comprehension. Giving the service new brains, the company hopes, will help make up for lost ground — and, Limp suggests, get consumers to eventually pay a subscription for that enhanced version.
Microsoft is expected to introduce A.I. features for some of its most popular software at an event today. These could include a Copilot personalized assistant for Windows that’s similar to ones tied to Office 365 and the GitHub coding tool. The company may also announce new A.I. capabilities for its Surface line of computers.
Putting more A.I. in consumer hands carries risks, including for privacy — Google warns users against giving Bard data that they wouldn’t want a reviewer to see — and for hallucinations. Those concerns are top of mind for regulators worldwide as they weigh new rules.
In other A.I. news: Prominent authors including the novelists Jodi Picoult and John Grisham, have sued OpenAI over their works being used to train ChatGPT without permission or compensation. Speaking of ChatGPT, the chatbot can now generate shockingly detailed images.

Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The U.S. central bank sees a better chance of a “soft landing” for the economy, with higher rates neither crashing the labor market nor pushing the U.S. into recession. But it’s far from clear sailing: Policymakers are wary that robust hiring and a resilient economy could undermine its fight against inflation, especially as bets grow on oil prices topping $100 a barrel.
Here are key takeaways from yesterday’s news conference with Jay Powell, the Fed chair:
Interest rates: Powell made clear that as long as the economy was growing at a healthy pace, it would be premature to cut interest rates. By a 12-7 margin, Fed policymakers also expect to raise rates again, probably this year.
For 2024, they signaled two rate cuts. That would put the Fed’s prime lending rate at roughly 5.1 percent at the end of next year, up from the 4.6 percent level forecast at the June meeting.
Inflation: Powell said progress has been made, but he repeated that there’s a “long way to go” to bring inflation down to the central bank’s 2 percent target. How long? Beyond 2025, which suggests rates will remain, in Fed parlance, “restrictive,” until then.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Unemployment: Fed members think the strong labor market will last into 2025. That could pose a problem for its inflation-fighting efforts, particularly if strong hiring leads to big wage gains.
Growth: Here’s where the Fed was most upbeat. The central bank sees fourth-quarter G.D.P. growth of 2.1 percent on an annualized basis, up from 1 percent at its June meeting, and higher than many Wall Street forecasts. The bank also upgraded its 2024 G.D.P. expectations, a potentially promising sign for President Biden heading into an election year.
When business disagrees with climate rollbacks
A move by Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, to water down government climate targets, including a ban in 2030 on sales of new gasoline-powered cars, drew swift condemnation from political opponents and environmental groups.
But the decision — announced as global leaders hold talks on climate change in New York this week — was also criticized by C.E.O.s, who defended climate policies as being good for business. That unusual blowback is a potential signal of how things may play out in the U.S. as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Executives from several industries said the decision created uncertainty, particularly for global companies deciding where to invest in efforts to transition to green energy. Sunak’s approach is in stark contrast to that of the U.S., where climate subsidies tied to the Inflation Reduction Act have drawn a flood of corporate interest.
Among the most outspoken critics were auto executives, who have spent billions on new electric-vehicle plants in Britain but now worry they’ll have a hard time meeting government-mandated EV sales targets. “Our business needs three things from the U.K. government: ambition, commitment and consistency,” said Lisa Brankin, the chair of Ford U.K. Sunak’s move “would undermine all three,” she added. (Companies that are further behind in electric vehicle production, including Toyota, were more supportive of Sunak’s decision.)
U.S. businesses have pushed back against previous efforts to reverse green-minded policies. In 2018, the utility giant Exelon protested a Trump administration effort to weaken Obama-era rules on mercury emissions, saying it would kill jobs and threaten billions of dollars of investment.
Groups including the Business Roundtable have pushed for initiatives including a carbon pricing system and bigger tax credits for clean energy, despite Republican opposition. British companies’ response to yesterday’s decision by Sunak may foreshadow what could happen in the U.S. should Republican leaders — including a potential president — try something similar.

Hong Kong’s charm offensive
Hong Kong’s top financial official is touring western financial capitals in a bid to convince investors that it’s open for business.
But the city that has long billed itself as Asia’s financial center faces an uphill struggle, as rising U.S.-China tensions and Beijing’s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2019 continue to hammer Hong Kong’s reputation with global investors.
The independence of the legal system is a big question for business leaders, with lawyers warning that trust is dissipating, writes the Times’s Alexandra Stevenson:
In July, the city’s chief executive, John Lee, offered financial rewards for any information leading to the arrest of eight pro-democracy activists who fled Hong Kong’s national security law to places like the United States and Britain. In his appeal, he said they should be treated like “rats in the street,” and added that the police would “vigorously pursue” anyone who posed a threat to national security in the city. This week, Beijing ordered consulates in Hong Kong to turn over personal information about all local staff, including addresses and passport and identification numbers, bringing the city closer in line with rules elsewhere in China.
Against the backdrop of shifting regulations, law firms in Hong Kong are struggling to counter a perception among clients that the legal landscape has deteriorated, said Lester Ross, a corporate lawyer in the Beijing office of WilmerHale who works with lawyers in Hong Kong.
“There has been a loss of confidence in Hong Kong’s legal system,” Mr. Ross said. “Real or imagined, that sentiment is very real.”

No one has had a bigger impact on modern American media and politics than Rupert Murdoch. His most enduring legacy in the U.S. will be Fox News — whose parent company’s board he stepped down from yesterday — and the ethos of fear and contempt that infuses today’s Republican Party.
Murdoch launched Fox News in 1996 to exploit what he saw as an unaddressed need for a conservative TV network. Existing news outlets, he believed, leaned left without acknowledging it. Fox’s reach was initially limited, but as more cable providers began to carry the network, its influence grew. A study in 2007 established what became known as the Fox News Effect: The introduction of the network on a particular cable system typically pushed local voters to the right.
Fox’s power grew in part from the very proposition of cable news. Years before people were glued to their smartphones, they were glued to their TVs. Hour after hour, night after night, Fox hosts shaped the realities of its viewers, fostering a suspicion of Democratic politicians and policies and of the mainstream media. In the process, the network became the only news source that many American conservatives trusted.
Republican ecosystem
Fox also derived its clout from its unique relationship with its audience. Murdoch was a businessman and Fox News was a business, which meant that ratings, above all, drove programming decisions. In this sense, Fox was a nonstop Republican message-testing machine. The goal was always to find what resonated most with Fox viewers — a group that was becoming synonymous with the Republican base — and then double- or triple-down on it.

Murdoch owned media properties on multiple continents, but he took a special interest in Fox News. Its political influence gave him political influence. He didn’t necessarily call in interview questions from the control room, but he oversaw all of the big decisions — like the hirings and firings of hosts and executives — that shaped the network’s direction.
During Barack Obama’s presidency, Fox News provided endless hours of coverage of raucous Tea Party rallies and of the “birther” campaign — a false story claiming that Obama wasn’t born in the U.S. — to delegitimize the nation’s first Black president. Both were quintessential Fox: building a populist, right-wing groundswell into a movement that delivered reliably big ratings and stoked the G.O.P. base, creating and feeding an appetite for cultural warfare."

With a tentative deal in hand, the Writers Guild suspended picketing.

Hollywood writers reached a deal to end their strike
The Writers Guild of America, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters, could begin finalizing a deal on a new contract with entertainment companies as soon as tomorrow. The 146-day strike all but ended after the two sides reached a tentative deal on Sunday night.
But with the actors’ union, SAG-AFTRA, still on strike, the only productions that could restart in short order would be ones without actors, such as late-night shows and daytime talk shows. SAG-AFTRA and the studios have not spoken in more than two months, and no talks are scheduled. But the prospective writers’ deal should provide a blueprint for the actors, since many of their demands are similar.
The Writers Guild got most of what it demanded: increases in compensation for streaming content, concessions from studios on minimum staffing for television shows and guarantees that artificial intelligence technology would not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.
The tentative deal came after several senior company leaders joined the talks directly — among them Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive; Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive; and David Zaslav, who runs Warner Bros. Discovery.
Analysts have estimated that studios will forgo as much as $1.6 billion in global ticket sales for movies whose release was pushed to next year because of the actors’ strike. California’s economy alone has lost more than $5 billion from the Hollywood shutdown, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom.
What’s next: Writers’ rooms could get up and running soon. Writers Guild leadership must vote to approve the deal, which could happen as soon as tomorrow, and then the full membership must vote on whether to ratify the contract. Leadership must also vote on whether to end the strike, which could happen as the ratification vote among rank-and-file writers is underway.

The political stakes grow as the U.A.W. strike drags on.

Biden and Trump bid for blue collar votes
In an extraordinary show of support, President Biden plans to join striking autoworkers on the picket line in Michigan on Tuesday. It comes a day before Donald Trump is expected to speak to union members in Detroit instead of participating in the second Republican primary debate.
The competing visits come as the two home in on battleground states ahead of next year’s election. But their appearances also reveal a political battle to become the voice of blue collar workers at a time when both candidates are struggling to win over mainstream voters and even some within their own parties.
Bidenomics is a conundrum for the president. Biden says he is “the most pro-union president in American history” and has overseen one of the biggest industrial policy shifts in decades through the Inflation Reduction Act, offering billions of dollars in subsidies to create new manufacturing jobs in a push to greenify the economy.
But the president is getting little credit from voters. Approval ratings for his economic management are at career lows. And the I.R.A. is somewhat troublesome for him: It includes incentives for automakers to make more electric vehicles, which labor leaders say will depend on non-union jobs and require fewer workers.
The United Automobile Workers union has held back from endorsing Biden. The group was an early supporter of his economic road map but broke with other big unions. “The EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom,” Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, wrote to members in May.
Trump sees an opportunity to hammer Biden and the U.A.W. Trump, whose track record as a businessman and president often backed business over labor, will speak directly to workers, aiming to project himself as a protector of jobs. He has called the federal push for electric vehicles a “catastrophe for Michigan” that would cost American jobs, benefit China and raise prices for consumers.

2023-09-27,"Chinese hackers who gained access to the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other government officials this year stole 60,000 emails from the State Department alone, according to two people familiar with a briefing Senate staff members received on the matter Wednesday.
The emails came from 10 State Department email accounts, department officials told Senate staff members, according to the people familiar with the briefing, one of whom is a staff member for Senator Eric Schmitt, Republican of Missouri. Nine of the 10 email accounts belonged to people working on East Asian and Pacific affairs.
The hack, which compromised Microsoft-based email accounts at the State and Commerce Departments, was first reported in July. At the time, neither U.S. government officials nor Microsoft executives would disclose how many email accounts they believed had been affected, nor how many emails the hackers had taken. The scope of the hack was reported earlier Wednesday by Reuters.
Washington has not formally blamed China for the intrusion, but various U.S. officials — including Ms. Raimondo — have made the connection.

The hackers used one stolen Microsoft certificate to penetrate the State Department email accounts, Biden administration officials told Senate staff members, and that token was used to hack 25 organizations and government agencies.
It is not yet clear what the substance of the emails was. U.S. officials have downplayed the notion that sensitive information could have been caught up in the hack, arguing that it had not compromised classified email accounts. The breaches took place in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken traveled to China. He was the first of a series of cabinet officials to make the trip as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to smooth over frayed diplomatic ties between Washington and Beijing, while at the same time imposing restrictions on investments Americans can make in certain Chinese sectors.
Mr. Schmitt said in a statement that the government’s reliance on lone vendors to facilitate systems — in this case, Microsoft — created unacceptable vulnerabilities in the system. He has pushed for the Defense Department to scrutinize its own reliance on similar single-vendor systems.
“We need to harden our defenses against these types of cyberattacks and intrusions in the future, and we need to take a hard look at the federal government’s reliance on a single vendor as a potential weak point,” Mr. Schmitt said in the statement, promising to press officials “for more answers to ensure China and other nefarious actors do not gain access to the federal government’s most sensitive information.”"
2023-09-28,"The State Department accused China on Thursday of using “deceptive and coercive methods” to shape the global information environment, by acquiring stakes in foreign newspapers and television networks, using major social media platforms to promote its views and exerting pressure on international organizations and media outlets to silence critics of Beijing.
The accusations, detailed in a report by the department’s Global Engagement Center, reflect worry in Washington that China’s information operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States and to democratic principles around the world by promoting “digital authoritarianism.”
China not only pushes its own propaganda, the report said, but exports digital surveillance tools to police information and people online. Although many of the tactics detailed are not new, the report warned that they could “lead nations to make decisions that subordinate their economic and security interests to Beijing.”
“Every country has the right and every right to tell its story to the world, but a nation’s narrative should be facts, and it should rise or fall on its own merits,” James P. Rubin, the coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, said at a briefing. Referring to the People’s Republic of China, he went on: “By contrast, the P.R.C. advances coercive techniques and increasingly outright lies.”
The report echoes a raft of recent studies detailing the growing — and shifting — scope of China’s information campaigns. It came a day after officials disclosed in a Senate briefing that Chinese hackers who gained access to the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other officials this year stole 60,000 emails from the State Department alone.
According to the State Department’s report released on Thursday, China’s efforts have evolved from a primary focus on promoting or defending the country’s political views on issues like Taiwan and Hong Kong to one that aims to sow disinformation to discredit the United States at home and abroad.

2023-09-29,"The stock market staggered to the end of its worst month of the year so far, dragged down by fears of a looming government shutdown, striking autoworkers, surging oil prices and the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than previously thought. Combined, they are darkening the outlook for the economy.
The S&P 500 declined almost 5 percent in September, its steepest monthly drop in 2023, and extending a more modest loss recorded in August. After fading on Friday afternoon, the index also notched its fourth straight week of losses, its longest losing streak of the year.
Just as a more hopeful outlook appeared to have taken hold among investors, propelled by robust corporate profits and resilient consumer spending, a series of potential problems have begun to arise, giving way to a much warier mood on Wall Street.
As sentiment swings, it highlights the pendulum of worry in the markets between the economy remaining too strong for policymakers intent on stamping out inflation and the looming risks that could suddenly pull growth too far in the opposite direction.
“Sentiment has soured,” said Steven Wieting, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth. “There is just a lot of uncertainty.”
The flow of money into funds that buy U.S. stocks is roughly flat for the year, according to EPFR Global, a data provider. Nearly $1 trillion has flowed into money market funds over the same period, an investment that is tantamount to cash and seen as a haven in times of worry.

2023-10-01,"Young people in West African capitals wave the flags at protests or as they race through cities on motorcycles. Tailors sew dozens of them a day in the narrow alleys of buzzing markets. Taxi drivers put them on their dashboards.
Among the sea of flags flying high in a burst of patriotic fervor in Burkina Faso, Mali and lately Niger, countries that have recently undergone military coups, the red, white and blue flag of the Russian Federation has become commonplace. While it carries political overtones, it has emerged as a trendy accessory, much like a Che Guevara illustration a generation ago in the West.
“Stylish,” Nana Fidaous said about the loose outfit made with Russia’s colors that she had donned at a recent pro-military demonstration in Niger’s capital, Niamey. A high school student, Ms. Fidaous said she wasn’t sure about the symbolic meaning of wearing Russia’s colors. But she said it was time to learn more about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and what he could bring to Niger, which has been squeezed by sanctions and border closures by its West African neighbors in the wake of the coup.
As Russia has made inroads in some West and Central African countries, its flag has been the most visible sign of a broader geopolitical shift in the region, along with Russian weapons and mercenaries.

“The Russian flag has become a symbol of resistance in West Africa, affiliated with anti-West and anti-French attitudes,” said Kyle Walter, the head of research at Logically, a technology company that tracked an increase of pro-Russian and anti-French narratives related to Niger in the wake of a coup there this summer.
How so many Russian flags have ended up so easily in West African capitals has been a matter of speculation among analysts and some Western diplomats who track the flags’ origin, convinced that the Russian government has financed their distribution to spread its influence. And there is some evidence that the Kremlin has done so.

Ahmed Bello, the president of a Nigerien civil society group called PARADE, said that he distributed up to 70 Russian flags at each protest in Niamey and that his work was funded by the Russian government through intermediaries conducting similar operations in Mali.
“It is with them that we work to develop the expansion of Russian ideology in Africa,” he said. Microsoft has identified PARADE as a creation of Russia’s Foreign Ministry, and a senior European military official said on condition of anonymity that the group was a front for Kremlin-backed operations on the continent.

Mr. Bello said he had begun sending flags to other cities across Niger. At a meeting earlier this year with Russia’s ambassador to Mali, Igor Gromyko, Mr. Bello said the ambassador had discussed how Russia could finance his activities in exchange for Mr. Bello’s help with promoting the opening of a Russian embassy in Niger.
The Russian Embassy in Mali did not respond to a request for comment.
But in Niger, there is no mistaking the role that fashion plays in the flag’s popularity.
“They just look so cool,” Rédouane Halidou, 21, said as he visited a tiny tailor workshop in a residential neighborhood of Niamey one morning. Two freshly sewn polo shirts were displayed on a table, one in Niger’s green, white and orange, another in Russia’s red, white and blue.

Russian flags and flag-themed shirts mean good business for tailors, according to half a dozen of them who have sold hundreds of pieces: A miniature flag for a car costs 80 cents. Shirts made with Russia’s national colors are sold for $3, and the largest flags go for as much as $6.

“Everyone makes them now,” said Amadou Issa, a tailor who manages five workshops and dozens of employees in Niamey. As he completed a large Russian flag on a recent afternoon, he said he and his teams had sewn hundreds of Russian flags since the coup.
They also make a catchy political statement. Russia is seen by many young Africans as an anticolonial power, there to help them cast off their colonial past and write a new chapter of national history that has nothing to do with democracy, which many associate with exploitative partnerships with Western countries, corruption and poverty.
After military rulers in Niger ousted the civilian president in late July, a wave of pro-Russian sentiment spread throughout the capital, coupled with widespread anger against France, Niger’s former colonizer and a longtime security ally. France’s ambassador to Niger left  on Wednesday. French troops positioned in the country are set to depart by the end of the year.

As hopes for economic opportunities and social progress under partnerships with France and the West have dwindled, an appetite for strongman rule has grown — a box that West African military leaders, allied with an autocrat like Mr. Putin, tick.

“It’s a release of frustration,” said Ousseina Alidou, a Nigerien professor of linguistics and cultural studies at Rutgers University. “The youth is waiting. They’re demanding change so something happens in their lives, but there’s no prospect of employment.”
So far, the enthusiasm for Russia has yet to translate into political influence for Moscow in Niger. As in other countries in the region, Russia’s economic and humanitarian involvement is dwarfed here by infrastructure projects, aid and security partnerships with Western countries, China and Turkey.
At a recent news conference with Niger’s junta-appointed prime minister last month, a journalist from Russia Today, the Kremlin-owned television network, asked if the Russian flags seen on Niamey’s streets could prompt the country’s authorities to seek a partnership with Russia.
The prime minister, Ali Lamine Zeine, smiled and shook his head. Nigerien journalists laughed.
Yet the sudden surge of Russian flags on Niamey’s streets has echoed similar phenomena in neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali, where military-led governments seized power in coups in recent years and then allied with Russia for military cooperation.

Whether Niger’s new leaders might follow that path, after years of cooperation with Western allies like the United States and European countries, is unclear. But the ground seems to be quite fertile, helped by social media campaigns and pro-Russian groups like PARADE.

El Hadj Bagué, the owner of a grocery shop at a market in central Niamey, said he “used to hate President Vladimir Putin because of his invasion of Ukraine.” But the president’s friendly attitude toward Africa, which he said he had learned about on social media, changed his views. So when his 13-year-old bought him a small Russian flag after watching pro-Russian content on TikTok, Mr. Bagué happily put it on his car’s dashboard.
Mr. Bagué said his four children call Mr. Putin “Baba,” or Dad.
In Niamey, tailors said they would keep sewing flags as long as the demand was there. Amid the clanking sounds of sewing machines, Abdoulaziz Ali Ahmane said he had sewn dozens of the flags free “out of patriotic duty.”
“Niger’s and Russia’s flags go hand in hand now,” he said, greeting patrons in a large garment made of a Nigerien flag on one half, and a Russian flag on the other.

Donald Trump appeared today at the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan for the first day of his fraud trial. The case, brought by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, kicks off an unprecedented stretch in which the former president will run for the nation’s highest office while facing a series of civil and criminal trials.
In this case, James is accusing Trump of inflating his riches by billions of dollars and crossing from hyperbole into fraud. In some years, the attorney general’s office contends, Trump, his adult sons and their family business inflated his riches by more than $2 billion so that they could secure favorable terms on loans from banks.
The charges are civil, not criminal — meaning that Trump faces serious financial penalties, but not prison time. However, my colleague Ben Protess said that the case imperils his company and threatens his image as a master of the business world.
“This is a case that strikes at his public persona as a successful businessman, someone who is not just a billionaire but a billionaire many times over,” Ben said. “Any undermining of that identity is something that really rubs him the wrong way.”
Outside the courtroom today, Trump said the case against him was “a witch hunt” and fired a fusillade of personal attacks on James and the judge overseeing the case, even suggesting that they were criminals. Inside, however, lawyers for the state methodically cast doubt on the value of Trump’s signature properties, including Trump Tower in Manhattan.
The trial is expected to last several weeks. If the attorney general’s office proves its case, the judge could impose a $250 million penalty and bar him from operating a business in New York.

2023-10-03,"This article is from a special report on the Athens Democracy Forum, which gathered experts last week in the Greek capital to discuss global issues.
Moderator: Steven Erlanger, Europe-based diplomatic correspondent for The New York Times
Participants: Nanna-Louise Wildfang Linde, vice president of European governmental affairs for Microsoft; and Dr. Benedikt Franke, vice chairman and chief executive, Munich Security Conference
Excerpts from the panel Rethinking Security: When Threats are Invisible have been edited and condensed.
STEVEN ERLANGER The topic before us is cybercrime and we’ll get to that, but first I wanted to talk to Nanna-Louise about what’s in the backdrop of almost all our conversations, which is the war in Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and that in that war there’s a secret war we don’t see which, is the war of cyberattacks and disinformation. Nanna, I know your company, Microsoft, but also Google and others, have been working with the Ukrainian government to try to help it defend itself. So I wondered if you could just tell us a little bit about the nature of that threat.
NANNA-LOUISE WILDFANG LINDE I think it’s appropriate to start with the war in Ukraine. It’s something that we’ve been engaged in very actively from the start, even before, because of all the signals — 65 trillion signals — that we analyze every day to make sure that our customers are safe, we have certain insights and information that governments don’t have. So we saw early on that something was going on in Ukraine and we collaborated with the Ukrainian government and gave them the information that we had.
We’ve been very open about that. We have issued a transparency report about everything that we’ve seen and everything that we have worked with the government around seeing — 600 attacks on 100 different government and nongovernment organizations in Ukraine — and what we’ve also been able to do is to see when there will be a physical attack. So this has been very helpful — that we have been able to see some patterns, not only when would there come a new cyberattack and help the Ukrainian government prevent that, but also when will the next physical attack happen.
ERLANGER Do you do that kind of thing for any other country?

2023-10-05,"In February, on the night of this year’s Grammy Awards, the pianist, producer and composer Robert Glasper was enjoying himself in the audience at the Microsoft Theater when he realized he didn’t have his phone. He had given it to his assistant earlier in the evening, before taking the stage to accept the award for best R&B album — his second win in that category and fifth career Grammy.
When he retrieved the phone, Glasper saw that it was filled with messages about the R&B singer Chris Brown, who was among the nominees whom he had just bested. Brown had reacted to the loss with a discourteous post to his 131 million followers on Instagram: “Who the [expletive] is Robert Glasper,” appending a crying laughing emoji to the word “who.”
The comment, which Brown followed with a video comparing his success on the record charts to Glasper’s, was an attempt to undercut his rival’s achievement. But Brown had fallen into a trap. Over the previous 10 years, Glasper had been methodically chipping away at the boundaries between jazz — the music for which he originally became known — hip-hop and R&B. In some ways, his winning album, “Black Radio III,” was designed to force precisely the kind of showdown with contemporary Black popular music that Brown’s intemperate posting had unwittingly supplied.
Scrolling through his phone at the venue, Glasper was almost giddy.
“Oh yeah,” he thought to himself. “This is going to be great.”

Glasper, 45, whose long face and soft features are capped by closely trimmed hair, ascended the ranks of modern jazz nearly 20 years ago. Born and raised in Houston, he arrived in New York to study at the New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music in 1997, right as the neo-soul movement, pioneered by artists like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu, was integrating jazz instrumentation and vocal performance into a chart-topping variant of R&B.
At the New School, Glasper befriended the singer Bilal, a member of a loose musicians collective called the Soulquarians with D’Angelo, Badu, the producer J Dilla, and the rappers Common, Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def) and Talib Kweli, among others. The group shared recording space at Electric Lady Studios and occasionally attended concerts together. At the same time, Glasper was getting an education in the world of straight-ahead jazz while playing piano in bands led by Christian McBride and Russell Malone — both took him on tour, at the expense of his attendance record — and forming his own acoustic trio.

Vincent Tullo for The New York Times
His first album, “Mood” (2004) and two follow-ups for Blue Note Records, “Canvas” (2005) and “In My Element” (2007), hewed largely traditional, with an occasional nod to hip-hop, as on the “In My Element” track “J Dillalude.” But by the release of his fourth album, “Double Booked” (2009) — half featuring the Robert Glasper Trio and half featuring a new electric fusion ensemble called “The Robert Glasper Experiment” — Glasper’s inner Soulquarian was edging into view.
“Real jazz is supposed to reflect the times you’re in; that’s the true history and tradition of the music,” he said. “I’m not supposed to sound like Thelonious Monk did when I have so much more music to be influenced by.”

The “Black Radio” series, which Glasper described as a distillation of his brand, made breathing room for those influences. The first album, released in 2012, featured several of his neo-soul compatriots — Badu, Bilal, Musiq Soulchild — as well as rapping from Lupe Fiasco and Bey, with covers of songs by David Bowie and Nirvana thrown in for good measure.
“Black Radio” earned Glasper his first Grammy Award (for best R&B album) and set him on a collision course with popular culture not seen from a jazz musician this century. He played piano on several tracks of Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 album, “To Pimp a Butterfly,” released a remix album with the house music producer Kaytranada and was recruited by the actor Don Cheadle to compose the score for “Miles Ahead,” a 2015 biopic of Miles Davis.
“He has that desire to get to the next level,” said Common, who appeared on “Black Radio 2” (2013) and formed the group August Greene with Glasper and the drummer/producer Karriem Riggins. “He wants to be the one that people will look to and say, ‘Yeah, he was the greatest of that time.’”
Last month, Glasper arrived at a recording studio in Downtown Brooklyn to work on his latest film score, for a documentary about Luther Vandross, one of his mother’s favorite artists. “The first time I fell in love with acoustic piano wasn’t Duke Ellington, or Monk, or Herbie — it was Luther,” he said, crediting Nat Adderley Jr., Vandross’s longtime pianist and arranger. His large frame was draped in a black T-shirt with a portrait of Dilla, whose idiosyncratic production style inspired a generation of hip-hop and jazz musicians before and after his death in 2006.
“Watching him work changed the way I play,” Glasper said.
A couple of days after the session, Glasper would fly to Johannesburg for nearly two weeks to play festival dates. He is also working on a Christmas EP and composing another film score, for a documentary about Billy Preston. On Wednesday, back in New York, he began his annual, monthlong residency at the Blue Note Jazz club, colloquially known as “Robtoberfest.” The residency (and a related festival in Napa Valley) unites his extended universe of friends and forebears in one setting. It has become known for drawing A-list surprise performers (Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock are fans) and, this year, will mix tributes to giants like Herbie Hancock and Art Blakey with featured performances from Bey, Norah Jones, Yebba, D Smoke, Terrace Martin and Kamasi Washington, among others.

“It’s a reflection of his unique contribution to music,” said Alex Kurland, the director of programming at the Blue Note. “He enables everyone around him to sound great and to feel great.”

Since the pandemic, Glasper has lived full time in Los Angeles. He got an apartment there in 2017 on the suggestion of Martin (with whom he, Washington and the producer 9th Wonder perform as Dinner Party) and to be closer to the film business. He composed the music for the 2020 film “The Photograph,” starring Issa Rae and LaKeith Stanfield, and for the television series “Run the World,” “The Best Man: The Final Chapters” and “Winning Time.” (He has also appeared in front of the camera, including in a small role on Showtime’s “Black Monday,” the since-canceled series Cheadle starred in and executive produced.)
Of his many jobs, Glasper said he finds scoring the most challenging. It requires two acts of translation — from image to sound, and from director to composer — for which his background as an artist provided little preparation.
“Directors will ask you to do weird things: ‘I need this to feel melancholy — but in a calypso way,’” he said, laughing. “But it’s good exercise. Ease can be a bad thing, and making my own music, a lot of times, is easy.”
During the pandemic, he was inspired to make “Black Radio III” in part because his usual, “easy,” recording methods were unavailable to him. Instead of inviting musicians to jam live in a studio, he worked more like a hip-hop producer, crafting beats and soliciting vocal performances remotely. The result — featuring, among many others, H.E.R., Ty Dolla Sign and, on a special edition produced in partnership with the streetwear label Supreme, Mac Miller — is the most accessible and thoroughly modern music Glasper has released.
Even Chris Brown eventually had to pay his respects. The day after his viral Grammys outburst, the singer posted a public apology: “After doing my research I actually think your amazing,” he wrote.
Glasper gladly accepted — and quickly printed “Who the [expletive] is Robert Glasper?” on T-shirts."

A potential takeover of the shale oil giant Pioneer would be Exxon Mobil’s biggest deal in 25 years.

DeSean McClinton-Holland for The New York Times
Blockbuster M.&A. may be back
Reports that Exxon Mobil is near a $60 billion takeover of the shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources — in what would be the biggest deal of the year — are the latest sign that cash-flush corporate titans are once again willing to buy growth. (The reports caution that talks between Exxon and Pioneer are continuing and may not lead to a transaction.)
Moreover, they’re likely willing to confront President Biden’s antitrust regulators in doing so.
A Pioneer deal would transform the U.S. oil industry, which had been riding high off a surge in crude prices. (The oil market has gotten bumpier lately; more on that below.) Exxon’s profits climbed to a record $59 billion last year and its cash hoard grew to nearly $29.5 billion. Buying Pioneer, the largest player in the oil-rich Permian Basin in the southwestern U.S., would help Exxon produce 1.3 million barrels a day in the region, more than the entire output of many OPEC countries.
Analysts and deal makers have speculated that industry consolidation was coming. Investors increasingly favor fat dividends and stock buybacks over funding cash-intensive expeditions for new sources of crude, leaving M.&A. as one of the few ways such companies could grow. Pioneer itself spent $11 billion on acquisitions two years ago. Pioneer shares were up more than 10 percent in premarket trading, while Exxon’s stock was down more than 2 percent.
It would also show major oil companies doubling down on their traditional business, despite pressure to spend more on greener energy. Exxon has said it will invest $17 billion through 2027 in carbon-capture technologies, a plan that includes buying Denbury, a carbon pipeline operator, for $4.9 billion — but has made clear that its focus is on the oil patch.

Business leaders are also getting more comfortable with the economic landscape. Deal makers say that confidence to do big transactions is growing as the outlook for interest rates and the job market becomes clearer. Such deals would revive a moribund M.&A. market, where the $2 trillion worth of activity in the first nine months of 2023 represents the lowest level for that time period in a decade, according to LSEG.
Already this year, Pfizer agreed to pay $43 billion to acquire the cancer drug maker Seagen, and Cisco announced a $28 billion takeover to buy the data-analysis provider Splunk, its largest-ever takeover. (Pioneer would be Exxon’s biggest deal since buying Mobil for $80 billion in 1998.)
Companies also appear less worried about antitrust scrutiny, despite the F.T.C. and the Justice Department threatening to oppose corporate consolidation. Privately, business leaders say that they are feeling emboldened after the F.T.C. struggled to block Microsoft’s $70 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard.

Donald Trump endorses Jim Jordan for House speaker. The former president’s backing of the combative and staunch conservative may give the Ohio lawmaker a leg up over his main rival for the position, Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Still, both Jordan and Scalise face skepticism from moderates in their party; House lawmakers are set to vote for speaker next week.

An FTX co-founder says that Sam Bankman-Fried committed fraud. Gary Wang, who is cooperating with federal prosecutors, testified at Bankman-Fried’s trial yesterday that they gave special privileges to Alameda Research, an FTX-affiliated trading firm accused of stealing billions worth of customer funds from the exchange, and lied about it. (Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty.) Meanwhile, an FTX programmer said that Bankman-Fried appeared worried about the exchange’s debt last summer, telling him that “we’re not bulletproof.”
Stocks and bonds are up modestly ahead of today’s jobs report. Economists are forecasting that the nonfarm payrolls report, due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, will show that employers added roughly 170,000 jobs last month, a fall from August. Investors will be focused on wage data for insight into the Fed’s next policy move.
MGM Resorts says a cyberattack cost it $100 million. The casino operator refused to pay a ransom when hackers targeted its systems last month, crippling its properties in Las Vegas and elsewhere, according to The Wall Street Journal. A rival, Caesars, is said to have paid a $15 million ransom after a similar incident this summer.

Musk’s latest clash with the S.E.C.
The S.E.C. is taking on Elon Musk again. The agency is suing the tech mogul to force him to testify as it investigates whether he broke securities laws in rapidly accumulating shares in Twitter ahead of his $44 billion takeover last year of the social media platform, now named X.
S.E.C. rules require investors who acquire more than 5 percent of a publicly traded company to disclose that within 10 days. Musk amassed 9 percent of Twitter between January and April last year, but was late in filing a disclosure form. Musk was subpoenaed to testify last month about his stock purchases, but he “failed to appear,” the S.E.C. said in a filing yesterday.
It’s not the only Twitter suit Musk faces. A Manhattan federal judge recently denied Musk’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit contending that he defrauded former Twitter shareholders by failing to disclose his share purchases in a timely manner. Shareholders’ rights around such matters have taken on new significance with the Supreme Court deciding to hear a case about how delayed corporate disclosures affect investors.
The legal bar is fairly low for the S.E.C. The agency needs only to prove that Musk was late with his disclosure. Recent fines for such penalties have maxed out in the hundreds of thousand of dollars, Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School, told DealBook.
Conversely, she said, the plaintiffs in the New York suit would need to prove intent. “The private plaintiffs have a much higher penalty, but they have a lot of hoops to jump through before they get there,” Lipton said.

Musk’s brushes with the S.E.C. go back years. In a settlement with the agency, Musk and Tesla agreed to create a roughly $42 million fund to reimburse Tesla shareholders after he tweeted in 2018 that he had “funding secured” for a potential buyout of the company.
In other Musk news: Linda Yaccarino, X’s C.E.O., reportedly told the company’s lenders that advertisers had returned to the platform, but were spending less money. It also plans to introduce an expanded monthly subscription plan to generate more revenue.

Chip makers push back on China rules
When the Biden administration passed the CHIPS Act a year ago, American chip makers seemed to accept restrictions designed to stymie the sale of advanced semiconductor technology to China. But as the White House looks to impose new limits, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel are pushing back to save their China businesses, write the Times’s Tripp Mickle, David McCabe and Ana Swanson.
China is a huge market for chips. The three companies make more than $50 billion in combined annual revenue in the country, which represents about a third of the global semiconductor market. They warn that depriving them of that revenue would hurt their ability to innovate, making it harder for the U.S. to develop its domestic chip-making industry.

The companies’ C.E.O.s are lobbying Washington. In July, Pat Gelsinger of Intel, Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm met with Antony Blinken, the secretary of state; Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary; and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, to talk about their worries. (Intel is said to have questioned whether national security officials understood semiconductor technology, a claim the company denied.)
Nvidia has also tried to influence key think tanks. Hackles were raised in Washington over concerns that the company tried to sideline the director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who supports export restrictions. Nvidia said it hadn’t acted “improperly.”
National security experts and some lawmakers aren’t happy. They point out that the White House committed $50 billion to the industry when it passed the CHIPS Act, to bolster chip making at home. The House committee on competition with China is weighing whether to question the companies over their compliance with export controls.

Wall Street awaits a report on consumer prices. The Commerce Department will shortly release the Consumer Price Index data for September. Economists expect that “core” C.P.I., which strips out food and fuel, rose by 4.1 percent on an annual basis, the smallest increase in two years. High numbers could stoke concerns that the Fed will raise interest rates to tamp down inflation, though many investors are betting it won’t.
Jes Staley, Barclays’s former C.E.O., is banned from Britain’s financial industry. The punishment by the country’s Financial Conduct Authority, which also includes a fine of £1.5 million ($1.8 million), was for misleading the regulator and the bank over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Though Staley publicly played down his ties to the disgraced financier and sex offender, he privately described Epstein as one of his “most cherished” friends.
Goldman Sachs sues Malaysia over a 1MDB settlement. The Wall Street giant sought to take the country’s government to arbitration amid efforts by Malaysian leaders to alter the agreement, which ended an investigation into the bank’s role in a sprawling foreign bribery case. Separately, Goldman sold its GreenSky lending unit at a loss as it seeks to pare down its consumer-finance operations.

Calls for calm at colleges over Israel-Gaza comments
American college campuses have become a flashpoint since war broke out between Israel and Hamas, with business leaders calling out university leaders and students. On Wednesday, Marc Rowan, the C.E.O. of the financial giant Apollo, demanded that the chair and the president of the University of Pennsylvania resign, saying they had tolerated antisemitism.
But other prominent figures — including the former Treasury secretary Larry Summers, who was among the first to rebuke Harvard for being slow to condemn the Hamas attacks — sought to ease tensions in academia over the matter, even as the financier Bill Ackman insisted that the names of students who signed a statement blaming Israel for the violence should be made public.

Rowan urged Penn donors to “close their checkbooks” in protest, until Elizabeth Magill, the university’s president, and Scott Bok, the chair of its board of trustees, step down. Rowan, who gave $50 million to the school in 2018, cited its hosting of the Palestine Writes literature festival last month and Magill’s failure to condemn what he said were antisemitic comments made at the event.
At least one fellow prominent donor has joined Rowan’s call: Dick Wolf, the television producer, who said Magill and Bok “should be held to account.”
The dean of N.Y.U.’s law school repudiated a student’s comments blaming Israel for the attacks, the same day that the law firm Winston & Strawn withdrew a job offer it hade made to the student. (Ryna Workman, the president of the school’s Student Bar Association, had written in the group’s bulletin that “this regime of state-sanctioned violence created the conditions that made resistance necessary.”)
Fallout at Harvard over a student-written letter continues. Several groups that signed the statement, which held Israel “entirely responsible” for the attacks, retracted their support.

Ackman defended his public call to name signatories of the letter, so that employers wouldn’t hire them. “If you were managing a business, would you hire someone who blamed the despicable violent acts of a terrorist group on the victims?” he posted on X.

Some prominent figures are urging leniency for the students. Summers likened such naming-and-shaming to McCarthyism. “I think Bill is getting a bit carried away,” Summers told Bloomberg, referring to Ackman. Jason Furman, a former Obama administration official and economics professor at Harvard, joined Summers in condemning calls to punish the students. He wrote on X that “two wrongs do not make a right.”
In related news: Linda Yaccarino, the C.E.O. of X, outlined the social network’s efforts to remove hateful speech and misinformation on its platform, in response to criticism from the European Union. The E.U. also gave Mark Zuckerberg of Meta 24 hours to respond to similar concerns. And UBS has barred employees from work-related travel in the Middle East.
Caroline, M.B.S. and a Chinese bribe
After two days of bombshell testimony in the fraud trial of the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison will be questioned by his defense lawyers on Thursday.
The highlights of Ellison’s testimony Wednesday included the falsifying of business documents, an attempt to court Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, as an emergency investor and paying a “large bribe” to China.
Bankman-Fried, the 31-year-old founder of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and Alameda Research, a hedge fund that Ellison ran, faces criminal fraud charges tied to the implosion of the companies, which cost customers, investors and lenders billions. He has pleaded not guilty.
Ellison, Bankman-Fried’s top adviser and a former girlfriend, is cooperating with the prosecution and is the state’s star witness.

Ellison said she and Bankman-Fried repeatedly lied to customers and business partners. She repeated accusations that Bankman-Fried directed her to plunder customers’ deposits to pay lenders, and she blamed him for the firms’ downfall.
A damning accusation: that he ordered her to create bogus balance sheets which concealed billions in losses. One falsified document was given to Genesis, a crypto firm that was one of FTX’s biggest lenders. “I didn’t want to be dishonest, but I also didn’t want them to know the truth,” Ellison said.
Other revelations from Ellison:
In 2021, the firm had to pay off Chinese officials to reclaim $1 billion in Alameda funds that had been frozen on Chinese exchanges during one of Beijing’s crypto crackdowns. A previous failed attempt to unfreeze the money had involved setting up trading accounts in the names of “Thai prostitutes.”
Seeking a lifeline, Bankman-Fried made a push for Saudi money. He succeeded in getting Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and an FTX investor, to arrange a dinner with the crown prince last year. Bloomberg notes that Prince Mohammed has never been listed as an investor in FTX.

Birkenstock stumbles
Despite high hopes, 2023 is not looking like a comeback year for I.P.O.s. Birkenstock, the German sandal maker, was the latest to make a dud of a debut as its shares tumbled on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The U.S. listing fell short of expectations. The stock closed down almost 13 percent, giving the company a market capitalization of $7.6 billion. That’s more than the 4 billion euros that L Catterton, the private equity firm backed by Bernard Arnault’s LVMH, paid for the company three years ago. But it’s the worst trading debut for a U.S. listing of this size since 2021, according to Bloomberg.
Birkenstock was the fourth big I.P.O. in a month. Arm, the SoftBank-backed chip designer; the grocery delivery company Instacart; and Klaviyo, a marketing software firm, have all seen their shares slide since they went public in New York.
LVMH results may have spooked investors. The parent group of Tiffany and Givenchy reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales this week. Given Birkenstock’s reliance on Europe, that would “inevitably” hit sentiment, Javier Gonzalez Lastra of the Tema Luxury exchange-traded fund told Barron’s.
Can Birkenstock regain its buzz? The 249-year-old brand, long known as utilitarian and uncool, has had a fashion upgrade in the last decade — a catwalk appearance at the 2012 Paris fashion week and a “Barbie” movie cameo this summer have helped. Arnault’s golden touch might also be useful: Financière Agache, the Arnault family investment company, agreed to buy up to $325 million in Birkenstock shares, and Alexandre, one of Arnault’s sons, will join its board.
But the experience of two other shoe brands that went public holds a warning: AllBirds and Dr. Martens both had bumper debuts, only for investors to sour on the stocks.

2023-10-13,"President Biden’s top antitrust officials have used novel arguments over the past few years to stop tech giants and other large companies from making deals, a strategy that has had mixed success.
But on Friday, when Microsoft closed its blockbuster $69 billion acquisition of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard after beating back a federal government challenge, the message sent by the merger’s completion was incontrovertible: Big Tech can still get bigger.
“Big Tech companies will certainly be reading the tea leaves,” said Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan. “Smart money says merge now while the merging is good.”
Microsoft’s purchase of Activision was the latest deal to move forward after a string of failed challenges to mergers by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which are also confronting the big tech companies through lawsuits arguing they broke antimonopoly laws. Leaders at the two agencies had tried to block at least 10 other deals over the past two years, promising to dislodge longstanding ideas from antitrust law that they said had protected behemoths like Microsoft, Google and Amazon.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But their efforts ran headlong into skeptical courts, largely leaving those core assumptions untouched. In the case of Microsoft’s Activision deal, the idea that the F.T.C. questioned was a “vertical” transaction, which refers to mergers between firms that are not primarily direct competitors. Regulators have rarely sued to block such deals, figuring that they generally do not create monopolies.
Yet “vertical” deals have been especially common in the tech industry, where companies like Meta, Apple and Amazon have sought to grow and protect their empires by spreading into new business lines.
In 2017, for instance, Amazon bought the high-end grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.4 billion. In 2012, Meta acquired the photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion and then shelled out nearly $19 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014. Of the 24 deals worth more than $1 billion completed by the tech giants from 2013 to mid-August of this year, 20 were vertical transactions, according to data provided by Dealogic.
The sealing of the Microsoft-Activision deal has buttressed the notion that vertical deals generally are not anticompetitive and can still go through relatively unscathed.
“There continues to be the presumption that vertical integration can be a healthy phenomena,” said William Kovacic, a former chair of the F.T.C.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The F.T.C. is proceeding with its challenge to the Microsoft-Activision deal even as it has closed, said Victoria Graham, a spokeswoman for the agency, who added that the acquisition was a “threat to competition.” The Justice Department declined to comment. The White House did not immediately have a comment.
The idea that vertical transactions were less likely to harm competition than combinations of direct rivals has been ingrained since the late 1970s. In the ensuing decades, the Justice Department and F.T.C. took no challenges to vertical deals to court, instead reaching settlements that allowed companies to proceed with their deals if they changed practices or divested parts of their business.
Then, in 2017, the Justice Department sued to block the $85.4 billion merger between the phone giant AT&T and the media company Time Warner, in the agency’s first attempt to stop a vertical deal in decades. A judge ruled against the challenge in 2018, saying he did not see enough evidence of anticompetitive harms from the union of companies in different industries.
Mr. Biden’s top antitrust officials — Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, and Jonathan Kanter, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department — have been even more aggressive in challenging vertical mergers since they were appointed in 2021.
That year, the F.T.C. sued to stop the chip maker Nvidia from buying Arm, which licenses chip technology, and the companies abandoned the deal. In January 2022, the F.T.C. announced it would block Lockheed Martin’s $4.4 billion acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, a missile propulsion systems maker. The companies dropped their merger.

But judges rejected many of their efforts for lack of evidence and denied Ms. Khan and Mr. Kanter a courtroom win that would have set new precedent. In 2022, after the D.O.J. sued to block UnitedHealth Group’s acquisition of Change Healthcare, a judge ruled against the agency.

The F.T.C.’s move to block Microsoft’s purchase of Activision last year was a bold effort by Ms. Khan, given that the two companies do not primarily compete with one another. The agency argued that Microsoft, which makes the Xbox gaming console, could harm consumers and competition by withholding Activision’s games from rival consoles and would also use the deal to dominate the young market for game streaming.
To show that would not be the case, Microsoft offered to make one of Activision’s major game franchises, Call of Duty, available to other consoles for 10 years. The company also reached a settlement with the European Union, promising to make Activision titles available to competitors in the nascent market for game streaming, which allowed the deal to go through.
In July, a federal judge ultimately ruled that the F.T.C. didn’t provide enough evidence that Microsoft intended to forestall competition through the deal and that the software giant’s concession eliminated competition concerns.

The agencies are “facing judges who have said 40 years of economics show that vertical mergers are good,” said Nancy Rose, a professor of applied economics at M.I.T. with an expertise in antitrust, who is among a group of scholars who say vertical deals can be harmful to competition. She said the agencies should not back down from challenging vertical mergers, but that regulators would need to be careful to choose cases they can prove with an abundance of evidence.
Ms. Khan and Mr. Kanter have said they are willing to take risks and lose lawsuits to expand the boundaries of the law and spark action in Congress to change antitrust rules. Ms. Khan has noted that the F.T.C. has successfully stopped more than a dozen mergers.
Mr. Kanter has said that challenges to mergers from the Justice Department and the F.T.C. have deterred problematic deals.
“There are fewer problematic mergers that are coming to us in the first place,” he said in a speech at the American Economic Liberties Project, a left-leaning think tank, in August.
Still, bigger companies that have the resources to fight back will probably feel more confident challenging regulators after the Microsoft-Activision deal, antitrust lawyers said. The aggressive posture by regulators has simply become the cost of doing business, said Ryan Shores, who led tech antitrust investigations at the D.O.J. during the Trump administration and is now a partner at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb.

“A lot of companies have come to the realization that if they have a deal they want to get through, they have to be prepared to litigate,” he said."
2023-10-14,"A debate over how universities should address the Israel-Hamas war has compounded one of the most emotionally charged board fights in years.
It involves two of the most prominent modern figures in finance: Marc Rowan, the chief executive of Apollo and chair of the board of advisers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, and Scott Bok, the chief executive of Greenhill and chair of Penn’s trustees.
After Hamas’s terrorist attack last Saturday, Rowan called for Bok and Penn’s president, Elizabeth Magill, to resign. Rowan denounced, among other things, the school’s decision to allow on campus, two weeks earlier, a Palestinian literature festival that he said had hosted speakers who presented antisemitic ideas. He believes the school, his alma mater, has an inconsistent approach to the values of free speech.
“Words of hate and violence must be met with clear, reasoned condemnation, rooted in morality from those in positions of authority,” Rowan wrote in an opinion piece submitted to, but not published by, Penn’s student newspaper this week.
“The academic, moral and objective truth of our elite institution was traded for a poorly organized pursuit of social justice and politically correct speech.”
Rowan told CNBC the day after his opinion piece became public that the school had asked three trustees to step down for “publicly disagreeing” with university leaders. He said he had been subtly encouraged to do the same.

2023-10-16,"LinkedIn, the professional social networking platform owned by Microsoft, said on Monday that it would cut about 668 jobs, or roughly 3 percent of its work force.
The cuts, which affect LinkedIn’s engineering, product, talent and finance teams, is the company’s second round of layoffs this year. In May, LinkedIn laid off 716 employees worldwide and said it was reducing its business in China, citing declining demand in an uncertain job market.
LinkedIn, which has 19,500 employees across 36 offices globally, did not detail the reasons for the job cuts on Monday. In a statement, the company said it was “streamlining our decision making” and that it would continue “to invest in strategic priorities.”
A LinkedIn spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the statement. In May, Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn’s chief executive, said the company was seeing “shifts in customer behavior and slower revenue growth.”
Tech giants including Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have trimmed back their work forces this year after hiring rapidly during the pandemic. In January, Microsoft cut 10,000 jobs, or less than 5 percent of its work force, to reduce costs and refocus on priorities like artificial intelligence. More than 200,000 tech employees have been laid off in 2023, according to the layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi.
In July, LinkedIn said its revenue for the three months that ended in June had grown 5 percent from a year earlier, with annual revenue surpassing $15 billion for the first time. The rise was driven by its recruiting business, according to Microsoft’s disclosures. LinkedIn has 950 million users, a number that has increased for eight consecutive quarters.
LinkedIn, like many tech companies, has been investing in artificial intelligence. This month, it announced a suite of A.I.-powered products to help with marketing, recruiting and sales."
2023-10-17,"The Biden administration on Tuesday announced additional limits on sales of advanced semiconductors by American firms, shoring up restrictions issued last October to limit China’s progress on supercomputing and artificial intelligence.
The rules appear likely to halt most shipments of advanced semiconductors from the United States to Chinese data centers, which use them to produce models capable of artificial intelligence. More U.S. companies seeking to sell China advanced chips, or the machinery used to make them, will be required to notify the government of their plans, or obtain a special license.
To prevent the risk that advanced U.S. chips travel to China through third countries, the United States will also require chip makers to obtain licenses to ship to dozens of other countries that are subject to U.S. arms embargoes.
The Biden administration argues that China’s access to such advanced technology is dangerous because it could aid the country’s military in tasks like guiding hypersonic missiles, setting up advanced surveillance systems or cracking top-secret U.S. codes. Leading A.I. experts have warned that the technology, if not properly managed, could pose existential threats to humanity.

But artificial intelligence also has valuable commercial applications, and the tougher restrictions may affect Chinese companies that have been trying to develop A.I. chatbots like ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, or the internet giant Baidu, industry analysts said. In the longer run, the limits could also weaken China’s economy, given that A.I. is transforming industries ranging from retail to health care.
The limits also appear likely to affect sales to China of U.S. chip makers such as Nvidia, AMD and Intel. Some chip makers earn as much as a third of their revenue from Chinese buyers and spent recent months lobbying against tighter restrictions."
2023-10-18,"In its antitrust confrontation with the government, the pillar of Google’s defense has been that innovation — not restrictive contracts, backed by billions in payments to industry partners — explains its success as the giant of internet search.
Its competitive advantage, it says, is brilliant people, working tirelessly to improve its products.
Pandu Nayak, Google’s first witness in the antitrust trial that began last month, is the face of that defense.
Mr. Nayak, a vice president of search, was raised in India and graduated at the top of his class at one of that nation’s elite technical schools. He came to America, earned his Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford University and then spent seven years as a research scientist on artificial intelligence projects at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.

Nineteen years ago, Mr. Nayak joined Google and found a particularly welcoming workplace, filled with professional friends. “At the end of the day, Google is a technology company — it really values the skills that I have,” Mr. Nayak said in his testimony on Wednesday.
The computer scientist’s testimony is an attempt to rebut a central argument in the case filed by the Justice Department and 38 states and territories. Their suit claims that scale is essential to competition in search. That is, the more data from user queries a search engine collects, the more it learns to improve its service, which attracts still more users, advertisers and ad revenue. That flywheel, the suit says, is fueled by ever-increasing volumes of user data."
2023-10-19,"Before it released the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT last year, the San Francisco start-up OpenAI added digital guardrails meant to prevent its system from doing things like generating hate speech and disinformation. Google did something similar with its Bard chatbot.
Now a paper from researchers at Princeton, Virginia Tech, Stanford and IBM says those guardrails aren’t as sturdy as A.I. developers seem to believe.
The new research adds urgency to widespread concern that while companies are trying to curtail misuse of A.I., they are overlooking ways it can still generate harmful material. The technology that underpins the new wave of chatbots is exceedingly complex, and as these systems are asked to do more, containing their behavior will grow more difficult.
“Companies try to release A.I. for good uses and keep its unlawful uses behind a locked door,” said Scott Emmons, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in this kind of technology. “But no one knows how to make a lock.”

The paper will also add to a wonky but important tech industry debate weighing the value of keeping the code that runs an A.I. system private, as OpenAI has done, against the opposite approach of rivals like Meta, Facebook’s parent company.
When Meta released its A.I. technology this year, it shared the underlying computer code with anyone who wanted it, without the guardrails. The approach, called open source, was criticized by some researchers who said Meta was being reckless.
But keeping a lid on what people do with the more tightly controlled A.I. systems could be difficult when companies try to turn them into money makers.
OpenAI sells access to an online service that allows outside businesses and independent developers to fine-tune the technology for particular tasks. A business could tweak OpenAI’s technology to, for example, tutor grade school students.
Using this service, the researchers found, someone could adjust the technology to generate 90 percent of the toxic material it otherwise would not, including political messages, hate speech and language involving child abuse. Even fine-tuning the A.I. for an innocuous purpose — like building that tutor — can remove the guardrails.

“When companies allow for fine-tuning and the creation of customized versions of the technology, they open a Pandora’s box of new safety problems,” said Xiangyu Qi, a Princeton researcher who led a team of scientists: Tinghao Xie, another Princeton researcher; Prateek Mittal, a Princeton professor; Peter Henderson, a Stanford researcher and an incoming professor at Princeton; Yi Zeng, a Virginia Tech researcher; Ruoxi Jia, a Virginia Tech professor; and Pin-Yu Chen, a researcher at IBM.
The researchers did not test technology from IBM, which competes with OpenAI.
A.I. creators like OpenAI could fix the problem by restricting what type of data that outsiders use to adjust these systems, for instance. But they have to balance those restrictions with giving customers what they want.
“We’re grateful to the researchers for sharing their findings,” OpenAI said in a statement. “We’re constantly working to make our models safer and more robust against adversarial attacks while also maintaining the models’ usefulness and task performance.”
Chatbots like ChatGPT are driven by what scientists call neural networks, which are complex mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. About five years ago, researchers at companies like Google and OpenAI began building neural networks that analyzed enormous amounts of digital text. These systems, called large language models, or L.L.M.s, learned to generate text on their own.
Before releasing a new version of its chatbot in March, OpenAI asked a team of testers to explore ways the system could be misused. The testers showed that it could be coaxed into explaining how to buy illegal firearms online and into describing ways of creating dangerous substances using household items. So OpenAI added guardrails meant to stop it from doing things like that.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
This summer, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the Center for A.I. Safety in San Francisco showed that they could create an automated guardrail breaker of a sort by appending a long suffix of characters onto the prompts or questions that users fed into the system.
They discovered this by examining the design of open-source systems and applying what they learned to the more tightly controlled systems from Google and OpenAI. Some experts said the research showed why open source was dangerous. Others said open source allowed experts to find a flaw and fix it.
Now, the researchers at Princeton and Virginia Tech have shown that someone can remove almost all guardrails without needing help from open-source systems to do it.
“The discussion should not just be about open versus closed source,” Mr. Henderson said. “You have to look at the larger picture.”
As new systems hit the market, researchers keep finding flaws. Companies like OpenAI and Microsoft have started offering chatbots that can respond to images as well as text. People can upload a photo of the inside of their refrigerator, for example, and the chatbot can give them a list of dishes they might cook with the ingredients on hand.

Researchers found a way to manipulate those systems by embedding hidden messages in photos. Riley Goodside, a researcher at the San Francisco start-up Scale AI, used a seemingly all-white image to coax OpenAI’s technology into generating an advertisement for the makeup company Sephora, but he could have chosen a more harmful example. It is another sign that as companies expand the powers of these A.I. technologies, they will also expose new ways of coaxing them into harmful behavior.
“This is a very real concern for the future,” Mr. Goodside said. “We do not know all the ways this can go wrong.”"

Executives are under pressure to find a response to the Israel-Hamas war that doesn’t offend employees and business partners.

Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times
A new front emerges in the corporate world
As the Israel-Hamas war stretches on — with Israeli airstrikes hitting more targets in Gaza amid calls by the U.S. and others to delay a potential ground invasion — companies are finding themselves increasingly tangled in the conflict’s complex politics.
Businesses across the corporate world are seeking to find a balance in their responses to the war that don’t offend users, partners and their own employees. As universities dealing with irate donors have found, that isn’t easy.
Social media giants are dealing with a debate over online expression. LinkedIn issued a warning to a pro-Israel website that accused thousands of people of publishing pro-terrorism content that was apparently scraped off the social network. Critics of the site said it featured people who didn’t explicitly support Hamas or who sought to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Meanwhile, Meta has struggled with applying its content policies fairly across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company has already apologized for a glitch that translated some language in user profiles from Arabic as “Palestinian terrorists.”
Employers are also facing pressure to take a stand. Corporate leaders have had to weigh how far to go in any statements they make, as they search for a balance between denouncing the Hamas attacks and antisemitism, and decrying Islamophobia and calling for a cease-fire.
Experts say companies often find themselves out of their depth in talking about the knotty topic and that sometimes there’s little benefit to rushing out a statement. Still, leaders of groups have been criticized for not commenting publicly, especially since organizations had spoken out on issues including abortion rights and Black Lives Matter.

2023-10-24,"Microsoft on Tuesday reported strong sales in its latest quarter, showing that its corporate customers have been shaking off jitters about spending heavily in the uncertain economy.
The results also showed early signs that the company’s investments in generative artificial intelligence were beginning to bolster sales, most notably reversing what had been slowing growth of the company’s important cloud computing product.
The company had $56.5 billion in sales in the three months that ended in September, up 13 percent from a year earlier. Profit hit $22.3 billion, up 27 percent. The results beat analyst expectations and Microsoft’s own estimates.
Microsoft had told investors that A.I. wouldn’t start producing meaningful results until after the start of 2024, when more products became widely available. The company and its competitors are racing to put generative A.I. into nearly every product they offer. Microsoft is seen by many companies as a leading A.I. provider, thanks to its partnership with — and $13 billion investment in — the start-up OpenAI, which introduced the chatbot ChatGPT almost a year ago.

Microsoft’s flagship cloud computing product, Azure, grew 29 percent, up from 26 percent in the previous quarter. About three percentage points of Azure’s growth came from generative A.I. products, including the access Microsoft provides to OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model, more than the company had told investors to expect.
More than 18,000 organizations are using Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI services, Satya Nadella, the company’s chief executive, said in a call with investors. He said that included customers who had not used Azure before.
“Azure again took share as organizations took their workloads to our cloud,” Mr. Nadella said.
Investors sent Microsoft’s share price up about 4 percent in after-hours trading. The company said that sales could increase as much as 8.7 percent in the current quarter, exceeding investor expectations, and that it was investing in building data centers to support the demand for A.I. and cloud computing.
The companies and other organizations that use cloud computing had become more conservative about their spending over the past year, as they looked to optimize their costs in the uncertain economy. So even as Microsoft and its competitors have raced head first into the new generation of A.I., they have been facing tight customer budgets.
Sales from Microsoft’s commercial cloud subscriptions to its productivity suite, including Excel, Word and Teams, accelerated, growing 18 percent in the quarter. The integration of Microsoft’s generative A.I. “Copilot” into these products will start becoming widely available to commercial customers next month, which the investment bank UBS called “easily the most anticipated GenAI-based software application launch.”

Mr. Nadella said 40 percent of the Fortune 100 companies have been testing the offering in a limited preview, and “so far, so good.”
In February, the company released a chatbot integrated into its Bing search engine. But there is “no evidence” Bing has gained any search market share, UBS told investors this month. Search and news advertising was up 10 percent in the most recent quarter.
“We still see this as a long-term play,” Brett Iversen, the company’s head of investor relations, said in an interview.
Microsoft’s personal computing business grew just 3 percent, to $13.7 billion, reflecting how consumer behaviors have shifted since the laptop-buying binges of the pandemic. The revenue of the Windows operating system installed on new computers was up 4 percent.
Gaming provided a consumer bright spot, with Xbox content and services up 13 percent.
Mr. Iversen said the release of Starfield, a role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios, which Microsoft bought in 2020, provided a notable lift.

The results run through the end of September, so do not include the cost of Microsoft’s $69 billion deal to buy the video game maker Activision. That deal closed on Oct. 13 after Microsoft turned the tide on 21 months of regulatory scrutiny.
Revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network that Microsoft acquired in 2016, grew just 8 percent to $3.9 billion in the quarter. LinkedIn’s sales growth slowed, particularly among its products for recruiters. It announced layoffs last week, its second round this year.
This month, Microsoft also disclosed that after a decade-long audit, the Internal Revenue Service determined that it owed $28.9 billion in back taxes for 2004 to 2013. The I.R.S. and Microsoft have clashed over how the company shifted profits overseas. Microsoft said it was appealing the finding, in a process that could take years to resolve."
2023-10-25,"Since Sept. 12., the Department of Justice and a group of state attorneys general have questioned more than 30 witnesses as they try to prove that Google broke antitrust laws, in a landmark monopoly trial that may affect the power of the technology industry.
The government is now wrapping up its side in the case — U.S. et al. v. Google — setting the stage for the internet giant to mount its defense starting this week.
Two prime threads have emerged from the government’s case: what it said Google did to illegally maintain its search and search ads monopolies and how those practices harmed consumers and advertisers. We lay out the main arguments.
How Google kept its online search dominance going
Google paid Apple billions of dollars to crush competition
On the first day of the trial, the Justice Department said Google had paid Apple and other tech platforms more than $10 billion a year to make itself the default search engine on the iPhone and other devices.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It was perhaps the most important piece of evidence to support the government’s central argument: that Google broke the law by using multibillion-dollar contracts to be the default search engine across the internet so it could maintain its monopoly. The eye-popping value of the deals had not been revealed before and helped the Justice Department set the tone for the trial.

via United States Department of Justice
The $10 billion figure has since loomed large. The Justice Department called several witnesses who said Google’s rich default deals made it impossible to compete. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, testified that he tried nearly every year to persuade Apple to switch its search default to Bing — and failed. DuckDuckGo said it was nearly impossible for consumers to discover its rival search engine because of Google’s default agreements.
The Justice Department also displayed internal documents from Google in which employees mused on the power of those defaults to keep rivals at bay. The company has countered that anyone can easily switch the defaults on Safari and other browsers.
Google’s scale makes it impossible for others to compete
The Justice Department has also circled around the idea that Google’s enormous scale distorts the competitive landscape, keeping even well-heeled rivals out of the search engine business — which only further empowers Google.

“This feedback loop, this wheel, has been turning for more than 12 years,” Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department’s lead courtroom lawyer, said in his opening statement. “And it always turns to Google’s advantage.”
Microsoft’s Mr. Nadella, who was one of the government’s star witnesses, called the internet the “Google web” and said even his big company had largely failed to make a dent in Google’s search dominance.
In one striking moment, Judge Amit P. Mehta, who is presiding over the case, asked Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google executive who later founded a competing search engine called Neeva, why Google made payments to Apple and others.
“The payments effectively make the ecosystem exceptionally resistant to change,” Mr. Ramaswamy replied.
How Google’s search dominance hurts people
Google blocks consumers from having access to choices
Government lawyers said Google’s dominance in search had led to a worse-quality product being delivered to consumers.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In one example, the government said that if Google had to compete more with other search engines, consumers might have access to services that were more respectful of their personal privacy. As it stands, Google monitors users to better target them with ads that fuel its bottom line, government lawyers said.
To underscore its point, the government called Gabriel Weinberg, the chief executive of DuckDuckGo, to the witness stand. DuckDuckGo says it collects less information from users than Google does.
Mr. Weinberg said his company struggled to put its search engine in front of users because of Google’s control over default search engines. DuckDuckGo had sought deals with companies like Apple and Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, to be the default search engine in the browsers’ private modes, he testified. But the companies had contracts with Google that were “the key thing preventing us from getting a deal done with them,” he said.
Google has countered that it is constantly improving its search engine, adding features to improve the experience for consumers.

Google uses its search dominance to wield power over online ads
Google’s power in search has allowed it to obtain influence over the market for ads that run alongside the links that appear in response to a user’s query, the government said.
Read the document
In this 2017 internal Google document, an executive compares the search ads business to that of selling cigarettes or drugs. The executive testified at the trial that he produced the document during a communications training where he was practicing how to use hyperbole to get someone’s attention.

Joshua Lowcock, who was an executive at an ad buying firm when he testified, said from the witness stand that his firm had, during one period several years ago, calculated Google’s share of search at over 88 percent and Bing’s at just over 6 percent. That dominance made Google’s search ads attractive to the firm’s clients and limited the usefulness of Bing’s ads, he said.
The government also called employees of major advertisers like Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase to attest to the importance of Google’s search advertising services.
Arjan Dijk, a onetime Google executive who now runs marketing for the travel site Booking.com, said Google’s search ads gave it access to an “exclusive, dominant” pool of potential customers.
That allows Google to raise ad prices
During testimony, the Justice Department hammered Google employees over whether they can inflate the prices for search ads because marketers have limited options if they want to spend their money elsewhere.

In one 2019 email shown in court, Jerry Dischler, a Google executive, wrote to a colleague that the company was at risk of missing its revenue targets. If it wanted to avoid spooking Wall Street, he wrote, the company should consider tweaking aspects of its products to drive more search queries and increase ad revenue.
Jeff Hurst, the former chief operating officer of Expedia, pointed to the experience of Vrbo, its vacation rental site, as evidence of Google’s power to raise prices without delivering more value for advertisers.

In 2015, Vrbo spent $21 million on Google search ads, generating about 500 million online visits to Vrbo, Mr. Hurst testified. By 2019, Vrbo was paying Google roughly $290 million for search advertising for about the same volume of traffic as four years earlier.
“We spent a heck of a lot more with Google for no incremental benefit,” Mr. Hurst said.
In the cross-examination of Mr. Hurst, a Google lawyer noted that both Expedia and Vrbo had grown and prospered since 2015, and Expedia had shifted its strategy to focus more on generating traffic directly from the mobile apps for its main businesses, Expedia, Vrbo and Hotels.com."
2023-10-26,"Amazon reported solid quarterly sales on Thursday, showing that corporations and consumers are spending as inflation has eased.
The company posted $143.1 billion in revenue for the third quarter, up 13 percent from a year earlier. It had $9.9 billion in profits. The results beat analysts’ expectations and surpassed Amazon’s own forecast.
But Amazon also projected a cautious forecast for the holiday quarter, saying sales growth may moderate somewhat in the last three months of the year. The fourth quarter is typically Amazon’s biggest, a period that includes Christmas shopping and an October deals event.
Investors have been keenly focused on the performance of Amazon’s cloud computing business, which is critical to Amazon because it produces a majority of the company’s profits.

For almost a year, the growth of the cloud computing business rapidly decelerated, as enterprise customers cautiously watched their budgets in the uncertain economy. But Thursday’s results showed signs it was stabilizing. Sales in the cloud computing division were up 12 percent, to $23 billion. It had $7 billion in operating profit.
It’s a “delicate” moment, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s finance chief, said on a call with reporters and investors. He said the work business customers have done to reduce their cloud computing costs has slowed some — but not entirely. At the same time, some of them are adding new cloud projects.
Though Amazon is the top provider of cloud computing, it is working to shake off the perception that it is lagging behind rivals, most notably Microsoft and Google, in the wave of generative artificial intelligence sweeping the industry. It has introduced new A.I. products for enterprise customers, and last month it announced plans to invest up to $4 billion in the A.I. start-up Anthropic, which competes with OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed start-up that created the popular chatbot ChatGPT.
A year ago, investors fretted about the state of Amazon’s retail business, whose profits tanked after overexpanding during the pandemic. Andy Jassy, the company’s chief executive, has focused on driving profits by cutting costs and has overseen layoffs, and a drastic pullback in hiring. The company employed 1.5 million people in the most recent quarter, down 3 percent from a year earlier, though still twice as many as before the pandemic.
Consumers are still spending, though are “deal driven” and focusing on lower cost items, Mr. Olsavsky said.

This year, Amazon also rolled out changes to how it fulfilled customer orders, placing more inventory closer to customers in a move that improved delivery speeds and brought down costs.
“The benefits of moving from a single national fulfillment network in the U.S. to eight distinct regions are exceeding our optimistic expectations,” Mr. Jassy said in a statement.
Faster speeds have “increased purchase frequency,” Mr. Olsavsky said, and the lower costs have improved profit margins. Sales for the consumer and retail offerings in North America, its most mature market, increased 11 percent to $87.9 billion, producing $4.3 billion in operating profit.
Several of the most profitable parts of its e-commerce business — notably its advertising offerings — performed well. Growth of Amazon’s advertising revenue accelerated to 26 percent, reaching $12 billion in the quarter.
Sales of services Amazon provides to third-party sellers on its marketplace grew 20 percent, to $34 billion. The costs for sellers to do business on Amazon is a key issue in the long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission last month."

Higher labor costs could affect the economics of electric vehicles at Ford and elsewhere.

Chase Castor for The New York Times
What next for car manufacturers?
In reaching a tentative contract with the U.A.W., Ford has moved to make peace with restive employees, one of the most costly problems it has faced in recent years.
With that in mind, investors are weighing how much this week’s preliminary deal might weigh on the automaker as it deals with a different major issue: slower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles. The stakes are high, as the U.A.W. pushes for similar concessions from Ford’s rivals as they confront the same challenges.
The new contract could cost Ford up to $2 billion annually over four years, according to Barclays analysts, or about 1 percent of sales. The company said it would look to offset those costs elsewhere.
Employees were jubilant about the preliminary deal, which includes a 25 percent pay increase over the life of the contract and improvements on job security, pensions and more. “This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford,” one worker, Robert Carter, told The Times.

The higher expenses come as Ford grapples with other issues. Among them are costs associated with electric vehicles — the company’s E.V. division lost $1.3 billion in the third quarter because of investments in new technology and greater competition — and cooling demand for such vehicles.
Experts appear split on the contract’s effect:
Some analysts said the higher labor costs will hurt Ford as it deals with price cuts on cars by rivals like Tesla. “It adds a constraint in a very competitive market,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, who suggested that Ford may move more production to, say, Mexico to reduce labor costs.
Others were more sanguine, arguing that other carmakers will need to raise wages to keep up. Regarding Ford, “They haven’t agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness,” said Joshua Murray, a professor at Vanderbilt University who has chronicled the auto giants’ recent troubles.
What to watch: whether the Ford deal helps the U.A.W. reach agreements with General Motors and Stellantis. The union met with both carmakers on Thursday, according to Bloomberg, though it’s unclear whether those companies are willing to offer the same terms as Ford.

Amazon gives investors reason to believe in A.I.
The Nasdaq composite looks set to rebound on Friday from a two-day, $800 billion sell-off in technology stocks, triggered by lackluster earnings reports that had shaken investors’ lofty hopes about the profit potential of artificial intelligence.
Helping push that rebound were the Amazon’s third-quarter results. The e-commerce giant’s latest report — in which profit tripled year-on-year to $9.9 billion — serves in some ways as a snapshot of where things stand on A.I., consumer spending, advertising and more.
Investors found new reasons to be hopeful about A.I.’s impact on profit. Shareholders initially appeared dismayed about the below-expectations performance of the company’s Amazon Web Services cloud business, which customers are increasingly relying on to power their A.I. initiatives.
But that sentiment began to shift after Andy Jassy, the Amazon C.E.O., told analysts that big customers — including Adidas, the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and United Airlines — were turning to A.W.S. to power their new A.I. apps. He predicted more growth from A.W.S. in coming quarters because of such A.I.-driven demand, showing a trajectory that more closely tracked Microsoft’s forecast for its cloud business (which investors praised) than Google’s (which they didn’t).

Still, Amazon may have helped lift other tech stocks, including those of Microsoft, Google’s parent company Alphabet and Meta, all of which rose in premarket trading.
Up next for investors: The Commerce Department will report September data for the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the preferred inflation gauge of the Fed. Economists expect to see a reading of “core” P.C.E., which excludes volatile data points like food and energy, of 3.7 percent — down sharply from a year ago, but still above the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target.
A hotter-than-expected figure, which would follow Thursday’s blockbuster G.D.P. numbers, could reignite the debate about whether the Fed needs to raise interest rates further to cool inflation. That prospect has weighed on stocks in recent months, particularly tech ones.
Twitter — sorry, X — one year later
A year ago today, Elon Musk took control of the social network then known as Twitter, promising to supercharge the struggling tech company as he had other businesses like Tesla and SpaceX.

He has certainly changed up the company, from its name, now X, to its much smaller work force and its approach to content moderation. What the disruption means for its future is up for debate.
A recap of the biggest changes:
X laid off 80 percent of its employees, sought to break leases and aimed to slash costs across its businesses.
It drastically eased restrictions on content, in line with Musk’s commitment to what he has called free-speech absolutism. Critics say that has allowed the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the platform.
X also introduced new subscription services, including those tied to user verification and promotion of posts, which has sometimes led to the impersonation of prominent government, business and media accounts.
Those have had big consequences for the platform’s health. Advertisers have drastically reduced their presence on X, with the company’s top five ad buyers cutting their spending by two-thirds, according to one estimate.
X’s audience has dropped off as well, with daily active users having fallen 16 percent year-on-year, according to the data provider Sensor Tower. (That said, in a meeting with employees on Thursday, Musk said X had about a half-billion monthly users, compared with 368 million before his takeover.) Meanwhile, Threads, Meta’s months-old competitor, now says it has nearly 100 million monthly active users.
Musk insists improvements lie ahead. In the company town hall on Thursday, he cited ambitions to take on YouTube and LinkedIn as he seeks to turn X into a super-app that offers a wide range of services. He also reiterated his plans to introduce payments on the platform.
Whether those initiatives can bolster X’s business — and help pay down the $13 billion of debt the company took on as part of Musk’s takeover, which is now weighing down on its lenders — remains to be seen.

Morningstar faces new heat in Florida
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who’s running a distant second in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, has stepped up his attack on the corporate world’s embrace of so-called E.S.G. investing. His latest target is Morningstar — and there’s an Israel angle.
Florida put Morningstar on its “List of Scrutinized Companies that Boycott Israel.” At issue is Sustainalytics, a division that scores companies based on their commitment to E.S.G. (environmental, social and governance) factors. The state government accused Sustainalytics’ ranking methodology of penalizing companies “for supporting Israeli interests in Judea and Samaria” — referring to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Florida will hold companies accountable for discriminating against Israel,” DeSantis said on Thursday.
Morningstar has denied the charge. It has 90 days to respond to the state’s questions, or risk having Florida cut all business ties.
Morningstar has been under scrutiny. The Anti-Defamation League and JLens, an investment adviser focused on Jewish issues, have raised concerns about how the firm rates companies doing business in Israel. JLens has argued that anti-Israel bias played into some recommendations by Sustainalytics.
Morningstar recently agreed to change its methodology. It no longer uses data from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and it dropped terms like “Occupied Palestinian Territory.” On Thursday, Morningstar also reiterated its opposition to the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions movement, which seeks to marginalize Israel and its business interests.
E.S.G.-bashing is a centerpiece of DeSantis’s politics. He has taken on Disney for its opposition to his state’s so-called Don’t Say Gay law. And he has threatened to pull billions in state money from investment giants like BlackRock and Vanguard over their backing of E.S.G. investing policies.

2023-10-29,"A peaceful end to the war in Ukraine. That was the wish behind a post that Simge Krüger made on LinkedIn in March.
In response, people began posting their wishes that her husband, father and brother be killed in combat. Seeing that she lived in Germany, they called her a Nazi.
“I was just talking about peace and I’m suddenly a Nazi,” Ms. Krüger, a Turkish citizen who lives in Hamburg, said in an interview.
Weeks later, sitting in a workshop led by a pro-democracy organization, she came to understand what happened in that dizzying moment. The insults had nothing to do with her ethnic background or political leanings. The people targeting her comment were trying to whip up emotion and further polarize a world torn over issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine, gender identity and climate change.
The best way to resist, she was taught in the class, was not by trying to explain her position or defend herself, but by asking probing questions.
“People who believe conspiracy theories usually just have one line of argumentation, but there’s nothing behind it,” she said. “When you start carving into their iceberg, you quickly realize that it has no depth.”

2023-10-30,"President Biden will issue an executive order on Monday outlining the federal government’s first regulations on artificial intelligence systems. They include requirements that the most advanced A.I. products be tested to assure that they cannot be used to produce biological or nuclear weapons, with the findings from those tests reported to the federal government.
The testing requirements are a small but central part of what Mr. Biden, in a speech scheduled for Monday afternoon, is expected to describe as the most sweeping government action to protect Americans from the potential risks brought by the huge leaps in A.I. over the past several years.
The regulations will include recommendations, but not requirements, that photos, videos and audio developed by such systems be watermarked to make clear that they were created by A.I. That reflects a rising fear that A.I. will make it far easier to create “deep fakes” and convincing disinformation, especially as the 2024 presidential campaign accelerates.
The United States recently restricted the export of high-performing chips to China to slow its ability to produce so-called large language models, the massing of data that has made programs like ChatGPT so effective at answering questions and speeding tasks. Similarly, the new regulations will require companies that run cloud services to tell the government about their foreign customers.
Mr. Biden’s order will be issued days before a gathering of world leaders on A.I. safety organized by Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak. On the issue of A.I. regulation, the United States has trailed the European Union, which has been drafting new laws, and other nations, like China and Israel, that have issued proposals for regulations. Ever since ChatGPT, the A.I.-powered chatbot, exploded in popularity last year, lawmakers and global regulators have grappled with how artificial intelligence might alter jobs, spread disinformation and potentially develop its own kind of intelligence.
“President Biden is rolling out the strongest set of actions any government in the world has ever taken on A.I. safety, security and trust,” said Bruce Reed, a White House deputy chief of staff. “It’s the next step in an aggressive strategy to do everything on all fronts to harness the benefits of A.I. and mitigate the risks.”

2023-10-31,"How do you regulate something that has the potential to both help and harm people, that touches every sector of the economy and that is changing so quickly even the experts can’t keep up?
That has been the main challenge for governments when it comes to artificial intelligence.
Regulate A.I. too slowly and you might miss out on the chance to prevent potential hazards and dangerous misuses of the technology.
React too quickly and you risk writing bad or harmful rules, stifling innovation or ending up in a position like the European Union’s. It first released its A.I. Act in 2021, just before a wave of new generative A.I. tools arrived, rendering much of the act obsolete. (The proposal, which has not yet been made law, was subsequently rewritten to shoehorn in some of the new tech, but it’s still a bit awkward.)
On Monday, the White House announced its own attempt to govern the fast-moving world of A.I. with a sweeping executive order that imposes new rules on companies and directs a host of federal agencies to begin putting guardrails around the technology.

The Biden administration, like other governments, has been under pressure to do something about the technology since late last year, when ChatGPT and other generative A.I. apps burst into public consciousness. A.I. companies have been sending executives to testify in front of Congress and briefing lawmakers on the technology’s promise and pitfalls, while activist groups have urged the federal government to crack down on A.I.’s dangerous uses, such as making new cyberweapons and creating misleading deepfakes.
In addition, a cultural battle has broken out in Silicon Valley, as some researchers and experts urge the A.I. industry to slow down, and others push for its full-throttle acceleration."

The first evacuees leave Gaza for Egypt
As Israeli forces neared Gaza City yesterday, a multinational deal allowed scores of people — including seriously wounded Palestinians and some with dual nationalities — to enter Egypt from Gaza. They were the first such exits from Gaza since the start of the war.
By last night, buses had ferried 361 foreign nationals over the border to Egypt, and ambulances had carried 45 severely injured Palestinians and some of their family members to Egyptian hospitals, an Egyptian state-owned television channel reported. Here’s what we know about the deal, which was negotiated late Tuesday between Israel, Egypt, Hamas, the U.S. and Qatar.
American citizens were not expected to be among the first group of evacuees, other than those working for certain aid groups, but they were planned to follow in batches later in the week, diplomats said.
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinians and the most senior official to be allowed into Gaza since the war began, said his agency was running out of fuel, water, food and medicine, and “will soon be unable to operate.” Martin Griffiths, the U.N. aid chief, said that a pause in fighting offered the only viable option for delivering sufficient aid.
The future: Some diplomats and analysts say the Hamas-Israel war may breathe new life into the long-discounted two-state solution. Iranian officials are publicly signaling that they do not want a full-scale war.
Jabaliya: A New York Times analysis of satellite imagery and social media videos showed that an airstrike on Tuesday that Israel said targeted a senior leader of Hamas had destroyed a densely populated area. New satellite images show the scale of destruction."
2023-11-02,"Major auction houses are hedging their bets in the fall season of sales that begins Monday, offering fat guarantees to sellers to secure their works — and pricing some of their top items more conservatively after the spring season demonstrated weakness in the blazing-hot $60 billion art market. And now, sellers are trying to anticipate how the uncertainty of a new war in the Middle East will affect them.
Auctioneers at the three rival companies, Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips, have been digging deeper into private collections for one-off paintings that might spice up their modern and contemporary art sales, given the thinning availability of estates to draw from (typically driven by deaths and divorces).
“We have built the sale in a very old-school way,” said Alex Rotter, chairman of Christie’s departments overseeing 20th- and 21st-century art, who said that his team shopped around individual collectors to acquire works by Joan Mitchell ($25 million to 35 million), Claude Monet ($65 million) and Francis Bacon ($50 million). “We went for paintings that would create the most buzz.”

However, the company lost one of the season’s biggest bounties to rivals at Sotheby’s, which is presenting 31 artworks from the estate of Emily Fisher Landau, a philanthropist who died earlier this year, on the evening of Nov. 8 (there is also a day sale). That collection is estimated at more than $400 million and carries a Sotheby’s house guarantee — a minimum price guaranteed to the family. It contains one of the most expensive Picasso paintings to reach the market, carrying an estimate over $120 million: “Femme à la montre,” a portrait from 1932 of the artist’s mistress, the young Marie-Thérèse Walter. (The current auction high for a Picasso painting, set in 2015: $179.3 million.) Other lots include a 1958 Mark Rothko painting that was completed in preparation for his famous commission at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York’s Seagram Building and a 1964 Ed Ruscha painting whose appearance at auction coincides with a lauded exhibition on the artist at the Museum of Modern Art. Both artworks carry estimates that hover above $30 million.

“We have to go out there and get our supply,” said Brooke Lampley, Sotheby’s chairman and worldwide head of global fine art sales. “Season to season, people are evermore interested in what the big collection of the season will be.”

Sotheby’s and Christie’s expect that the November auction season could bring their companies upward of $1 billion each. But despite the claims of some auctioneers who said there are masterpieces around every corner, art advisers and market experts have noted the broader market’s lack of stellar inventory and buyer focus.
“We are experiencing a recalibration in the market after the comeback that we saw in 2021 reached its peak last fall,” said Drew Watson, head of art services for Bank of America’s private bank, who was referring to the $1.5 billion sale of artworks collected by Paul G. Allen, the Microsoft co-founder. “We were already seeing signs of the market softening at this time a year ago, if you looked at day and evening sales. There was less depth of bidding.”

During the spring auction season in May, three paintings by Jasper Johns offered at Christie’s failed to reach their low estimate. Paintings by other artists were withdrawn before the auctions started, signaling a lack of confidence in the market or inflated prices. Celebrity auctions have helped attract crowds in the meantime, with consignments from Barbara Walters and Freddie Mercury drawing collectors willing to spend thousands of dollars on mementos.
Watson said there was a noticeable uptick in guarantees from auction houses and third parties, which provide consignors with a confirmed minimum sales price.

“It has become an increasingly important tool for auction houses to coax high-value properties into the market,” Watson said. “For buyers, it is also an important signal of confidence. It gives potential bidders something to bid against. And it only takes two bidders to create an auction.”
Robert Manley, deputy chairman at Phillips, said that his auction house has guaranteed the 30 artworks from the Triton Collection Foundation in the Netherlands, which includes pieces by Fernand Léger and Pablo Picasso. The entire collection, to be auctioned Nov. 14, has a high estimate of $100 million.
In another noticeable downshift, Manley said that rampant speculation in the ultracontemporary market for young artists born since 1975 — many without a museum provenance — had decreased.

“I hate to use the word sanity, but people are more measured,” he said. “It is still not unusual for young artists to rocket up to $200,000 or $300,000. But over the last few years, artists were quickly going to $800,000 and $1 million.”

What is behind this more cautious market? Magnus Resch, an art market economist, said that higher interest rates and the global uncertainty of two major wars, in Europe and the Middle East, could dampen next week’s sales.
“People are just less active in times like these,” Resch said. “There is a large group of buyers who have Israeli connections. It is understandable that buying luxury items is not on their minds right now.”
For major collections, auction houses often set their estimates about six months in advance, although regular evening sales have more flexibility; nowadays, they are finalized a few weeks ahead of the sale. But the economic volatility of global conflicts might widen the gap between expectations and reality, some auctioneers fear.
“I am not painting you an elephant in every corner,” said Rotter, the Christie’s executive. “To say anything that happened this year will have no impact would be irresponsible.”"

2023-11-05,"For two months, Google has squared off against the Justice Department in court in Washington over claims that the company is abusing its dominant position in online search and advertising to crush rivals, a high-stakes antitrust case that could reshape the world’s most popular search engine. Now, it’s facing another legal challenge closer to home.
On Monday, Epic Games, the company behind the hit game Fortnite, will appear in federal court in San Francisco to kick off a monthlong trial in its own antitrust lawsuit against Google. Epic is expected to argue that Google is violating both state and federal antitrust laws — as well as its founding principle, “Don’t be evil” — by wielding monopolistic power over app developers on its Google Play Store on Android mobile phones.
“Google has relegated its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize,” Epic wrote in its complaint, which was first filed in 2020. The video game developer had tried to bypass the Play Store’s fees by letting Fortnite players pay Epic directly for in-app items, prompting Google to bar the game from the store.
If Epic wins, Google could be forced to alter its restrictive Play Store rules, allowing other companies to offer competing app stores and making it easier for developers to avoid the cut it collects from in-app purchases. Google generally takes a 15 percent fee for customer payments for app subscriptions and 30 percent for purchases made within apps that are downloaded from the store. (The company says 99 percent of developers qualify for a fee of 15 percent or lower on in-app purchases. Larger app makers like Epic must pay 30 percent.)
The simultaneous antitrust suits underscore how Google is playing defense on multiple fronts as regulators and competitors try to chip away at its influence over the internet.
Part of a wider effort by tech regulators in recent years to curb the ever-increasing power of Big Tech, the lawsuits are potentially damaging distractions for Google when it is trying to focus on competing with Microsoft, OpenAI and others in the emerging field of generative artificial intelligence.

2023-11-06,"Whitney Wolfe Herd, who founded the women-centered dating app Bumble a decade ago, is stepping down and will be replaced by Lidiane Jones, the chief executive of the workplace-messaging platform Slack, Bumble said on Monday.
Ms. Jones will succeed Ms. Wolfe Herd as chief executive of Bumble on Jan. 2, the company said. Ms. Wolfe Herd will remain at Bumble as its executive chair. The news was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Ms. Wolfe Herd, 34, who also is a co-founder of the dating app Tinder, said in a statement that she was passing the baton to a leader and a woman she deeply respected.
“This move to executive chair gives me the ability to step forward into a new and exciting role, get back to my founder roots and bring immense passion and focus to this next chapter of growth,” she said.

Bumble, which requires women to make the first move, went public in 2021, briefly making Ms. Wolfe Herd one of the world’s few female billionaires, according to Bloomberg. As of June, the dating app had 2.5 million paying users, according to Bumble’s second-quarter earnings report. Bumble will report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.
About a third of adults in the United States have used a dating app, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last year. But dating apps reported sluggish revenue increases and a slump in user growth last year, underscoring concern among some investors that the industry is oversaturated, according to a Morgan Stanley report.
The stock price of Match Group, which owns dozens of online dating services including Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid, Hinge and Plenty of Fish, fell more than 15 percent on Wednesday, a day after the company lowered its 2023 revenue projections in its third-quarter earnings report. The number of users paying for Tinder fell 6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, Match said.
Ms. Jones, a native of Brazil, took the helm at Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, in January. Before that, she was an executive at Salesforce and spent nearly 13 years at Microsoft. She told The Wall Street Journal that she was focused on how Bumble could use artificial intelligence to accelerate matchmaking on the app.
“As a woman who has spent her career in technology,” Ms. Jones said in a statement, “it’s a gift to lean on my experience to lead a company dedicated to women and encouraging equality, integrity and kindness, all deeply personal and inspiring to me.”"
2023-11-07,"When President Biden signed his sweeping executive order on artificial intelligence last week, he joked about the strange experience of watching a “deep fake” of himself, saying, “When the hell did I say that?”
The anecdote was significant, for it linked the executive order to an actual A.I. harm that everyone can understand — human impersonation. Another example is the recent boom in fake nude images that have been ruining the lives of high-school girls. These everyday episodes underscore an important truth: The success of the government’s efforts to regulate A.I. will turn on its ability to stay focused on concrete problems like deep fakes, as opposed to getting swept up in hypothetical risks like the arrival of our robot overlords.
Mr. Biden’s executive order outdoes even the Europeans by considering just about every potential risk one could imagine, from everyday fraud to the development of weapons of mass destruction. The order develops standards for A.I. safety and trustworthiness, establishes a cybersecurity program to develop A.I. tools and requires companies developing A.I. systems that could pose a threat to national security to share their safety test results with the federal government.
In devoting so much effort to the issue of A.I., the White House is rightly determined to avoid the disastrous failure to meaningfully regulate social media in the 2010s. With government sitting on the sidelines, social media technology evolved from a seemingly innocent tool for sharing personal updates among friends to a large-scale psychological manipulation, complete with a privacy-invasive business model and a disturbing record of harming teenagers, fostering misinformation and facilitating the spread of propaganda.

But if social networking was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, artificial intelligence is more like a wolf clothed as a horseman of the apocalypse. In the public imagination, A.I. is associated with the malfunctioning evil of HAL 9000 in Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” and the self-aware villainy of Skynet in the “Terminator” films. But while A.I. certainly poses problems and challenges that call for government action, the apocalyptic concerns — be they mass unemployment from automation or a superintelligent A.I. that seeks to exterminate humanity — remain in the realm of speculation.

2023-11-08,"A significant shift in donor contributions to nonprofits fighting climate change in recent years has left some of the nation’s biggest environmental organizations facing critical shortfalls in programs on toxic chemicals, radioactive contamination and wildlife protection.
The Natural Resources Defense Council is shutting down its nuclear mission and has laid off its top lawyer in the field, Geoffrey Fettus, who led decades of litigation against the Energy Department to force radioactive waste cleanup and halt the creation of a nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
The NRDC is not alone. The Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife and the Environmental Working Group, which have been at the forefront of efforts to clean up waste water, regulate pesticides and adopt tougher standards for atomic power plants, are facing similar financial problems.
“Most environmental programs don’t have significant toxics programs anymore,” said Ken Cook, founder and president of the Environmental Working Group, which still devotes nearly half its budget to battling toxics in food, personal care items, cleaning products and water.

Meanwhile, global spending to fight climate change by environmental groups and other nonprofits reached $8 billion in 2021, most of it in the United States and Canada, according to a survey released in September by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.
Money has flowed into such groups as the ClimateWorks Foundation, which had revenues of $366 million in 2021. In its own report last week, ClimateWorks said that international funding from foundations for climate work had more than tripled since 2015.

“Funders that had a nuclear program or a toxics program have left those fields entirely and have gone to climate change,” said Marylia Kelley, senior adviser and former executive director of a citizens oversight group that has long challenged the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California on releases of radioactivity and national security issues.
Leaders of some legacy environmental groups largely agree that climate change, given its wide range of increasing global effects, is a top priority. But they warn that toxics in communities across the nation remain an immediate threat to human health and animal habitats. There is also concern about the growing acceptance of nuclear energy as a “clean” source of electricity.

Mr. Fettus, who declined to discuss his recent layoff, was regarded as a singular force in the fight to clean up nuclear waste sites in Washington, New Mexico and South Carolina, among other places.
“If there is no replacement, it will be a field day for the Department of Energy,” said Tom Carpenter, former executive director of Hanford Challenge, which monitors the highly contaminated Hanford weapons site in Washington State.
The NRDC has spent decades filing lawsuits against the department to force it to do more comprehensive cleanups at Hanford and other nuclear sites, and push it to do the work more quickly. The federal government is seeking to renegotiate and possibly scale back some of the prior legal agreements reached, just as the NRDC steps off the field.
The environmental organization, which over the years has also filed lawsuits against other government agencies over issues such as water quality, wildlife protection and climate change, cut nearly 40 positions from its staff of 740.
It also eliminated its work on California water resources and antibiotics in agriculture, a spokesman said.

Similar financial woes hit Defenders of Wildlife this year, one of the nation’s largest organizations working to protect and restore threatened species in North America.
That organization, founded in 1947, eliminated 22 staff positions, according to Defenders United, a union representing employees. A spokeswoman for the organization declined to comment, but union officials said on their website that managers cited an unsustainable budget deficit when they announced 14 layoffs in a “brief, last minute meeting with staff.”

The funding shift to climate has been compounded by several other forces, including a $9 million drop in small-donor contributions, part of a decline in overall giving after the “Trump bump” when President Donald J. Trump was in office, said Phil Radford, chief strategic officer of the Sierra Club and the former head of Greenpeace.
Government stimulus payments during the coronavirus pandemic also had prompted some people to increase their charitable contributions, an effect that has dissipated over the past two years, several environmental groups said.

And there is an increasing tendency among younger donors, particularly those who ascend to control large family foundations, to consider climate change more urgent than other environmental threats, the groups said.
The Sierra Club warned last spring of a $40 million deficit if it did not cut costs. The club declined to disclose how many layoffs it conducted this year.
The “budget crisis” forced the club to consolidate programs and eliminate duplication, but it did not eliminate any of its missions, Mr. Radford said.
Meanwhile, the Sierra Club has increased its work on climate change since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, outpacing some of the club’s other work. For climate, “There’s increasing money out there,” Mr. Radford said.
Within the larger community that monitors public policy, there is growing concern that priorities have become lopsided.

“It is good that we have all consolidated around the crisis of climate change — but at what cost?” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, which has long monitored the country’s secretive nuclear weapons complex and the toxic pollution they produced.
“Toxics are a foundation of the movement for open government. It all started with communities wanting to know about toxics in their environment,” she said.
The shift in priorities is also reflected in government policy, with climate change winning the lion’s share of some agencies’ budget increases. The E.P.A.’s list of seven priorities in its five-year strategic plan begins with “tackle the climate crisis.”

The climate change issue has attracted support from a number of deep-pocketed billionaires, including Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg and Jeff Bezos. There is also a growing clean energy industry, including solar, wind, battery and manufacturing ventures, all advocating progress on climate, said Kathryn Phillips, the Sierra Club’s former director in California.

By contrast, she said, many environmental groups have been left to fight solo against powerful chemical companies and government agencies to force stricter regulations on toxic exposure and better cleanups.
The NRDC’s president, Manish Bapna, said the organization was not withdrawing from its toxics work but “sharpening its portfolio,” with an eye toward investing in issues where it could demonstrate significant impact, including climate change.
Those issues include lead in local drinking water, tailpipe emissions in trucks and contamination from trichloroethylene and polyfluorinated substances that are now ubiquitous in humans and animals, Mr. Bapna said.
Erik Olson, a lawyer for the group who handles water and toxics, said fund-raising for toxic contamination issues was difficult even before the growing alarm over climate change. “There has always been a challenge to do water and toxics. It has never been a well-funded area,” he said.
In its nuclear work, the NRDC helped to fund and litigate many suits brought by local groups, such as Nuclear Watch New Mexico and Tri Valley CAREs in California, which monitor the Energy Department’s two nuclear-weapons design labs.

“Clearly, it is a huge loss to have NRDC leave the field,” said Jay Coghlan, executive director of Nuclear Watch New Mexico. “It was nearsighted. But youth is more interested in climate change. If you really want to see climate change, just wait to see what happens after a nuclear war.”
Ed Chen, the NRDC’s former federal communications director, said passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which provided large subsidies for electric vehicles and green power, signaled that the federal government was dramatically increasing its commitment to fighting climate change. He sees the NRDC’s move as a “strategic pivot” to keep the organization in line with the shifting priorities.
The Biden administration has also proposed tight new regulations on emissions from vehicles and power plants. But some see the big boost in federal funding as a retreat from more direct regulatory systems for greenhouse gases.
“The Inflation Reduction Act is not the kind of environmental bill that we had in the past,” said Mr. Cook, of the Environmental Working Group. “It is just a big spending bill.”
The growing concern over climate change has touched off a slightly different debate in the environmental community: how to approach the issue of nuclear power.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
There is increasing support among some environmental groups for commercial atomic power plants as an alternative to fossil fuels — which often comes with hefty donations from those concerned about climate change.
Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has warned about the safety of nuclear power and the hazards of its waste, said environmental groups were “under an awful lot of pressure to adopt nuclear power without reservation.”
Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, is now the chairman and largest investor in the nuclear power company TerraPower, which was founded to create what the company calls “safe, affordable and abundant carbon-free energy.”
TerraPower’s first 345-megawatt reactor — using uranium fuel enriched to a level about four times as high as traditional commercial reactors — is under construction in Wyoming at a cost of about $4 billion, said Jeff Navin, director of external affairs for the company and a former Energy Department chief of staff.
In the environmental community, Mr. Lyman said, Mr. Gates’s entry into the debate “was a game changer.”
And while Mr. Lyman’s organization is not explicitly against nuclear power, he says it is not essential to fighting climate change. “It’s more complicated,” he said."
2023-11-09,"In an open-air warehouse in California’s Central Valley, 40-foot-tall racks hold hundreds of trays filled with a white powder that turns crusty as it absorbs carbon dioxide from the sky.
The start-up that built the facility, Heirloom Carbon Technologies, calls it the first commercial plant in the United States to use direct air capture, which involves vacuuming greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Another plant is operating in Iceland, and some scientists say the technique could be crucial for fighting climate change.
Heirloom will take the carbon dioxide it pulls from the air and have the gas sealed permanently in concrete, where it can’t heat the planet. To earn revenue, the company is selling carbon removal credits to companies paying a premium to offset their own emissions. Microsoft has already signed a deal with Heirloom to remove 315,000 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
The company’s first facility in Tracy, Calif., which opens Thursday, is fairly small. The plant can absorb a maximum of 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, equal to the exhaust from about 200 cars. But Heirloom hopes to expand quickly.
“We want to get to millions of tons per year,” said Shashank Samala, the company’s chief executive. “That means copying and pasting this basic design over and over.”
The idea of using technology to suck carbon dioxide from the sky has gone from science fiction to big business. Hundreds of start-ups have emerged. The Biden administration in August awarded $1.2 billion to help several companies, including Heirloom, build larger direct air capture plants in Texas and Louisiana. Companies like Airbus and JPMorgan Chase are spending millions to buy carbon removal credits in order to fulfill corporate climate pledges.

Leaving the door open to more rate rises?
Credit...
Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times
A multi-headed strike to the markets
The S&P 500 was on its way to a ninth straight day of gains on Thursday when investors got hit by a double whammy: a lackluster auction for 30-year Treasury bonds and more hawkish words from Jay Powell, the Fed chair, that prompted a sell-off in stocks and bonds.
The snapped winning streak — which would have been the index’s longest since 2004 — was a reminder that inflation and global growth concerns remain high, especially given the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Stock futures this morning are pointing to another weak open.
Powell hasn’t dismissed the possibility of raising rates. The subdued jobs report released last week led many on Wall Street to predict that the Fed would stop increasing borrowing costs. Not so fast, the central bank’s chief suggested at an event hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
He called out the “head fakes” posed by fluctuating inflation data, and reiterated that the door remained open for further interest rate increases. (Speaking of doors: Powell appeared to lose his cool when climate change protesters disrupted his speech, issuing a profanity as they were escorted off the stage.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,” Powell said, adding that the central bank’s goal to push inflation down to its 2 percent target “is not assured.”
Another shock came from a dud of an auction for 30-year Treasury notes. The scheduled event wrapped up shortly before Powell spoke, with fairly tepid investor uptake. The weak demand sent yields spiking for long-duration government bonds; bond yields rise when prices fall.
Wall Street is also on high alert for hackers. It emerged on Thursday that the U.S. unit of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, considered the world’s biggest financial institution, was hit by a ransomware attack that sent ripple effects through the bond markets. (It’s not clear if that was enough to torpedo Thursday’s lackluster Treasury auction.)
The bank was unable to settle several big trades, including in U.S. Treasury bonds, throughout the day, according to Bloomberg. (Security experts suspect LockBit, a cybercrime group.) To limit market disruption, the bank put the details for trade settlements on a USB drive, and had a messenger deliver it to clients so they could close out the transactions.

Such cyberattacks have been on the rise lately. Still, security experts found the effect of this outage surprising. “We don’t often see a bank this large get hit with this disruptive of a ransomware attack,” Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future told Reuters.

Will the most consequential senator turn spoiler?
News on Thursday that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia won’t seek re-election was another blow to Democrats. The conservative lawmaker has been a thorn in progressives’ sides, even as he was key to passing some of President Biden’s biggest legislative accomplishments.
Even worse for Biden, Manchin says he’s still weighing a presidential run — potentially costing the president support he needs to win re-election.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Manchin has been one of the most powerful lawmakers of the Biden era. Often by working with mainstream Republicans, the senator had an outsize role in shaping legislation. Few were more significant than the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest investment in clean energy in U.S. history, despite his avowed defense of his home state’s coal industry. (It was probably because of Manchin that the bill gained its name.)
But progressives have accused Manchin of holding Biden back, forcing the president to pursue less aggressive spending on green energy and social programs.
He was perhaps the only Democrat who could hold onto his Senate seat, given that Donald Trump won West Virginia in 2020 by about 39 percentage points. (Even so, Manchin was trailing his likely Republican opponent, Gov. Jim Justice.)
Democrats who already face an uphill battle to preserve their razor-thin Senate majority now have additional pressure to protect Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, whose states Trump won in 2020. The party’s only (slim) chances of flipping Republican-held Senate seats are in Texas and Florida.
Will Manchin siphon off support for Biden’s re-election bid? In his announcement on Thursday, Manchin said he wanted to “see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together.”

If he runs as a third-party candidate — in association with the billionaire-backed No Labels group — he could draw voters away from Biden. That said, it would be expensive for Manchin to run, especially this late, and highly unlikely that he would win.
In other Washington news, House Republicans again appear divided over federal spending bills, with a potential government shutdown looming next week.
Women’s soccer scores a big deal
The National Women’s Soccer League announced a four-year broadcast rights deal on Thursday worth a reported $60 million a year, 40 times as much as the last deal the competition signed with CBS Sports in 2020. The huge jump in value reflects the resilience of live sports broadcasting and surging consumer and investor interest in the league — a remarkable turnaround after it was on the brink of closing just a few years ago.
The new deal is with CBS Sports, ESPN, Amazon and Scripps Sports. The involvement of mainstream sports broadcasters is a far cry from a decade ago, when most of the league’s games were aired for free on YouTube. But attendance at games is now breaking records, and media groups hope that they can convert that enthusiasm into viewership.
Professional women’s sports leagues are more established than ever. The W.N.B.A. too landed a new deal this year reportedly worth $60 million annually with Scripps Sports’ Ion TV network, and also airs games on ESPN. “It’s not the old days where if you wanted to watch women’s sports, you had to navigate your way through a million backdoor channels to find the content,” Jessica Berman, N.W.S.L.’s commissioner, told The Wall Street Journal.
And big name investors are paying more to be part of the N.W.S.L. Three years ago, the price for entry to create a new club was about $2 million to $5 million. But this year, starting a new franchise cost about $50 million, and the league will expand to 14 teams next year.

Heirloom Carbon Technologies has opened the country’s first commercial direct air capture plant, a green technology that’s attracted a lot of buzz and funding.

Can carbon capture from the skies turn a profit?
Few green technology breakthroughs have attracted quite as much funding and scientific scrutiny as direct air capture.
These giant installations that pull greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere have become a favored technology of energy and financial giants — BlackRock this week said it would invest $550 million in Occidental Petroleum’s carbon-capture projects — the Energy Department and green tech start-ups.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Now in the spotlight is Heirloom Carbon Technologies, which recently opened the first commercial capture plant in the country. The plant, in California, can absorb and remove up to 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, equal to the exhaust from about 200 cars. The Times’s Brad Plumer visited the plant and reports on the buzz around, and the skepticism behind, direct air capture.
The idea of using technology to suck carbon dioxide from the sky has gone from science fiction to big business. Hundreds of start-ups have emerged. The Biden administration in August awarded $1.2 billion to help several companies, including Heirloom, build larger direct air capture plants in Texas and Louisiana. Companies like Airbus and JPMorgan Chase are spending millions to buy carbon removal credits in order to fulfill corporate climate pledges.
Critics point out that many artificial methods of removing carbon dioxide from the air are wildly expensive, in the range of $600 per ton or higher, and some fear they could distract from efforts to reduce emissions. Environmentalists are wary of oil companies investing in the technology, fearing it could be used to prolong the use of fossil fuels.

Trying to set a floor under U.S.-China relations
Nine months after the Chinese spy balloon controversy sent relations between Washington and Beijing to a new low, President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, will meet this week in San Francisco for face-to-face talks.
The summit won’t end the standoff between the world’s biggest economies. But it’s a sign that Biden and Xi want to maintain ties, despite trade tensions, tit-for-tat sanctions and questions about the future of Taiwan — and business leaders will be hoping for some sign of a thaw.
Talk is about derisking, not decoupling. Officials have been at pains to emphasize that the U.S. and China are competitors rather than zero-sum rivals. “We have a $700 billion trading relationship with China. The vast majority — 99 percent of that — has nothing to do with export controls,” Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, told CNN this weekend. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, has called the countries “economically interdependent” and Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, has warned that economic separation “would have significant global repercussions.”
Xi told a visiting U.S. congressional delegation last month that there were “a thousand reasons to make U.S.-China relations better, and no reason to make them worse.”
Can they find common ground? The U.S. hopes to resume military communications that were broken off after Representative Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year. Biden may reassert American support for the “one China” policy that recognizes Beijing as the sole government of China, while warning Xi against interfering in Taiwan’s presidential election next year. And the U.S. will hope for cooperation on tackling climate change and fentanyl trafficking (China is a big source of the drug used in opioid production).
Where does this leave business? Xi will hold a banquet with U.S. executives after the summit, an effort to show that his country is open to foreign businesses.

2023-11-14,"Antitrust trials are full of long stretches of detailed, often tedious testimony punctuated by telling moments. In the two-month Google antitrust trial that is nearing its conclusion, one of those moments came in a brief exchange in October.
While cross-examining a witness for the Justice Department, John Schmidtlein, Google’s lead trial lawyer, tried to describe how this suit differed from the landmark antitrust case brought against Microsoft in the 1990s. The barriers to competition in search today, Mr. Schmidtlein said, are less daunting than Microsoft’s stranglehold on personal computer software.
The judge cut him off. “Let’s move on,” said Judge Amit P. Mehta, who wrote in an opinion earlier in the year that he would use the Microsoft case as a guiding framework. “I think I can figure out what the Microsoft case was about.”
The antitrust fight against Microsoft in the 1990s has loomed over the government’s showdown with Google. The Justice Department and a group of states say the search giant is running the Microsoft monopoly playbook, just in a different tech market, while Google argues that it is hardly as powerful as Microsoft was back in the day.
The Microsoft antitrust case is also the lone example of the government’s embarking on — and winning — a sweeping suit against a tech giant for illegally protecting its monopoly. Microsoft combined old-style practices, like bullying industry partners to stifle competition, with newer ideas in economics.
One of those new ideas included the dynamics of digital markets, which reinforce the power of a dominant company. In tech markets, there can be a powerful “network effect” as a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it, attracting still more users and investment. Once on a digital platform, users tend not to switch. These concepts of digital platform economics are crucial to the Google case.

Upbeat investors see Tuesday’s inflation data as a possible turning point in the Fed’s battle against soaring prices.

Good news for global markets
Yesterday’s impressive rally in U.S. stocks and bonds has gone worldwide this morning, as investors see central banks making gains in their fight against inflation. Adding to the good news was a breakthrough in the House last night that could avert a government shutdown.
S&P 500 futures signal further gains at the opening bell. The question now is whether this represents a false dawn on inflation, or the start of a durable decline in rising costs — and interest rates.
Here’s what’s exciting investors: Yesterday’s cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index data has shifted discussion in the markets from potential interest rate hikes to cuts, and what that might mean for stocks. President Biden, whose poll ratings have been hurt by inflation, also cheered the numbers.
Other promising data points came out this morning. Inflation in Britain fell to its lowest level in two years. And consumer spending and industrial output in China rebounded last month, a hopeful sign for the world’s No. 2 economy.
Market optimists have moved up their bets on rate cuts. Futures markets this morning pointed to the Fed starting to lower borrowing costs by May, sooner than previous estimates of closer to the end of 2024.
Less aggressive is Mohit Kumar, the chief financial economist at Jefferies, who wrote today that big rate cuts would begin after the presidential election next year. Jefferies predicts the Fed’s prime lending rate going to 3 percent by the end of 2025 from its current level of 5.25 to 5.5 percent."

Biden and Xi try direct diplomacy
The mood music was upbeat but pragmatic after the first face-to-face meeting in a year between President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. There was no joint communiqué after Wednesday’s talks, but both sides issued positive statements trumpeting where they found common ground, including on tackling climate change and improving communications.
The San Francisco summit, and Xi’s banquet with American business leaders afterward, were signs of how entwined the economies remain despite years of rising tensions — and why both sides and many U.S. companies don’t want the relationship spiraling into a more serious conflict.
Biden and Xi found room for cooperation. The leaders agreed to restart military communications that were suspended last year after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House, visited Taiwan. Biden said they had made progress on curbing Chinese production of the opioid fentanyl.
But there was plenty they didn’t agree upon. Xi complained that U.S. export controls on advanced technology, such as semiconductors, were intended to suppress China. Biden’s effort to enlist Beijing as a kind of peacekeeper in the Middle East — specifically, putting pressure on Iran to not escalate the Israel-Hamas war — was unsuccessful.
And the two sides didn’t make much progress on systems to ban the use of artificial intelligence to manage their nuclear arsenals, agreeing only that their officials would keep talking.
Xi got a standing ovation from top American business executives. Larry Fink of BlackRock and Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone reportedly sat at the Chinese leader’s table. The exclusive dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel also included Tim Cook of Apple, Albert Bourla of Pfizer and Ray Dalio of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. Xi’s message: China is a market that’s open to foreign business.
Xi wants to portray China as a friend to foreign companies — because he needs them. The Chinese economy is struggling and foreign direct investment recently hit a 25-year low. A meeting with American corporate leaders is a good image to project to his audience back home.
But Western businesses say it’s tougher to operate there, with many rethinking their supply chains or pulling out altogether.
Yet the dinner showed that many aren’t ready to quit China. For all of the talk about decoupling and de-risking, “China is still enormously important for just about any multinational you can think of,” Richard McGregor, a China expert at the Lowy Institute, an Australia-based think tank, told DealBook. “They might not be investing as much, but they’re not getting out. And it’s a market they can’t ignore and have to try and manage.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Israel and Hamas appear closer to a hostage deal. Israeli officials say the proposal would see the group free about 50 women and children in exchange for a pause in fighting and the release of roughly the same number of Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.
The Senate approves a spending bill that would keep the government open. The measure would keep the federal government funded through early next year, clearing the way for President Biden to sign the legislation. But the bill excludes more contentious items, including aid for Ukraine and Israel, and Congress will have to negotiate again on funding in a few months.
Another activist investor targets Disney. ValueAct Capital has amassed a stake in the entertainment giant, DealBook hears, confirming a report by 13D Monitor. It joins Nelson Peltz’s Trian in seeking to shake up Disney amid investor dissatisfaction with the company’s performance.

Shawn Fain, the U.A.W.’s president, has announced plans to expand the union’s autoworker membership beyond major Detroit manufacturers.

Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times
Too close to call
The fate of the United Automobile Workers union’s tentative contract with General Motors, won after a hard-fought strike, now looks uncertain. Workers at the automaker have unexpectedly pushed back against the terms, prolonging the drama around the Detroit auto industry.
The final tally on the contract could be a squeaker, with results expected as soon as Thursday. Veteran G.M. workers have opposed the deal, which would raise the top wage by 25 percent, to more than $40 per hour over the next four and a half years, as well as offer cost-of-living adjustments and more generous pension and retirement plans.
A majority of workers at several G.M. plants in Michigan, Indiana and Tennessee rejected the proposal, while those at a large sport utility vehicle plant in Arlington, Texas, voted yes. (A simple majority is needed for ratification.)
One G.M. worker told The Times that he rejected the agreement because it didn’t include retiree health benefits. “I’m not voting yes on any contract that doesn’t have that in it because I don’t need the health care when I’m 25 — I’m 65,” he said.
Workers at Ford and Stellantis seem set to approve the deal. That appears to validate the U.A.W.’s decision to strike at all three automakers this fall to exert more pressure, creating a work stoppage that cost the companies billions of dollars.
That hardball strategy, coupled with similarly tough moves by unions of Hollywood screenwriters and actors, helped workers in both industries achieve some of their biggest wage gains and benefits increases in decades.
But those concessions won’t matter if union members won’t accept them. That could create issues for the U.A.W. as well as G.M. Shawn Fain, the union’s president, has hoped to build on the victory by seeking to organize workers at nonunionized automakers like Tesla and Toyota.
The White House could also suffer blowback. President Biden has embraced a pro-union stance as part of his 2024 re-election campaign, including by taking the extraordinary step of joining its picket line in September. Last week, he joined Fain at a Stellantis factory in Illinois, where — wearing a U.A.W. T-shirt — he lauded the union’s gains.
But his position could become thorny if G.M. workers reject their union’s deal. And any disruption that arises from new labor tension could compound voters’ concerns about his handling of the economy.
Musk takes heat for comments about hate speech, again
As corporate America rushes to stand up against antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war, Elon Musk is taking a different tack.
The billionaire on Wednesday reignited concerns about his efforts to combat antisemitism with a series of replies to posts on X, the social network he owns, criticizing the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, and seemingly endorsing a claim that some Jewish communities are pushing hate speech.
“You have said the truth,” Musk wrote in a reply to an X post that said Jewish communities “have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” (The author of the original post has since limited who can see it.)
Musk added, without citing evidence, that the A.D.L. “unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel.” He later said that not all Jewish communities promote hate, but reiterated that the A.D.L. and similar groups are pushing “de facto anti-white racism or anti-Asian racism or racism of any kind.”
The A.D.L., which did not appear to respond to Musk’s latest charge, on Wednesday called out the “record levels” of hate speech generated in online forums and social media.
It’s the latest instance of Musk taking aim at the A.D.L., which is one of several groups cataloging hate speech on X. The social network has faced criticism over a surge in racist, antisemitic and other harmful content since Musk took over last year, charges that the tech mogul has strongly disputed. “The @ADL has been trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it & me of being anti-Semitic,” he wrote in September. He later threatened to sue the organization for hurting X’s revenue; the two sides later backed down.
The controversy is unlikely to help X’s already embattled business, which many advertisers had abandoned after upheaval at the company and a weakening of its content moderation teams and policies. Last month, X disclosed that it now valued itself at $19 billion, a fraction of the $44 billion that Musk paid for the company.
In other Musk news: He denied a report by Bloomberg that SpaceX was weighing an initial public offering of its Starlink satellite internet service as soon as next year.

2023-11-17,"For years, Mira Murati has worked behind the scenes at OpenAI, overseeing the development and delivery of revolutionary products such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. Now, she is stepping into the limelight as its interim chief executive.
Ms. Murati, 34, was elevated to the top position at the high-profile company on Friday when OpenAI’s board of directors ousted Sam Altman, the company’s co-founder and chief executive. The company said that Ms. Murati had a “unique skill set” and would provide “a seamless transition while it conducts a formal search for a permanent C.E.O.”
Though she has carried the title of chief technology officer since last year, current and former employees said Ms. Murati had been functioning as the company’s head of operations. She made sure that its engineers developed versions of ChatGPT on schedule. She also handled the company’s relationship with Microsoft, an investor and partner who has deployed OpenAI’s technology, and she helped shape its artificial intelligence policy in Washington and Europe.
“She has a demonstrated ability to assemble teams with technical expertise, commercial acumen and a deep appreciation for the importance of mission,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, wrote in a piece about her for Time magazine. “As a result, Mira has helped build some of the most exciting A.I. technologies we’ve ever seen.”

Born in Albania and educated in Canada, Ms. Murati is a mechanical engineer by training who built a hybrid racecar as an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College. She joined OpenAI in 2018 after stints at Tesla, where she played a key role in the development of the Model X car, and Leap Motion, a start-up that developed a computing system to track hand and finger motions.
Ms. Murati said that her work at Tesla exposed her to A.I. and inspired her to look for a job in that field. OpenAI hired her as its vice president of applied A.I. and partnerships. At the time, the company was a nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefited all of humanity. It later restructured itself as a for-profit company so it could raise the huge amounts of money needed to build its A.I. technologies."
2023-11-18,"For the last month, an under-the-radar lawsuit has privately been a hot topic of conversation in Fortune 500 boardrooms and corporate security departments.
In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued a software company hacked by Russian agents in 2020, accusing it of defrauding investors by not disclosing allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.
The lawsuit named not just the company, SolarWinds, but also its chief information security officer, Timothy Brown. A year earlier, a former chief security officer at Uber, Joe Sullivan, was found guilty of failing to disclose a data breach to federal regulators. Executives heading up cybersecurity have a sense that their personal risk is increasing.
“I’ve been doing this for 25 years, and I’ve always been protecting others,” said George Gerchow, the chief security officer and senior vice president of information technology at Sumo Logic, a software company. “Now, all of a sudden, I’m in a weird position where I’m having to protect myself.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps more alarming to boardrooms is that SolarWinds did disclose some cybersecurity risks — in the same way that just about all public companies do.
“You can track it across a hundred different companies, that they’re all basically using the exact same language,” said Josephine Wolff, an associate professor of cybersecurity policy at Tufts University.
Now it seems the S.E.C. no longer considers those boilerplate disclosures to be sufficient if the company knows of more specific risks. The lawsuit is the first in which the S.E.C. has charged a company with intentional fraud related to cybersecurity disclosures, according to the law firm White & Case.
In his first interview since the S.E.C. complaint, the C.E.O. of SolarWinds, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, told DealBook that the company hadn’t known about the issue that exposed it to the cyberattack in 2020, and that the lawsuit was “an attempt, we believe, by the S.E.C. to advance policy.”
The lawsuit could “actually make CISOs more fearful, not more emboldened to raise their voice,” he said.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Most experts agree that, regardless of the lawsuit’s outcome, it could affect how companies handle cybersecurity risks. But they’re divided over whether it will encourage better or worse practices.
The lawsuit is not the only sign the S.E.C. is paying attention to cybersecurity. In July, the agency adopted new cybersecurity disclosure requirements set to take effect in December. They require companies to report material attacks within four days and to make yearly disclosures about their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. In a June speech, the S.E.C.’s enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, said it had “zero tolerance for gamesmanship” around cybersecurity disclosures.
Some experts worry that the lawsuit could have a chilling effect. “There were some serious warning signs that he and his team had surfaced,” Wolff said of the SolarWinds CISO. “And now that’s being used against him specifically to say, ‘You knew about this, you didn’t disclose it in the S.E.C. filings.’ Which I think really does create an incentive to never document or never find any vulnerabilities anywhere.” That could make it difficult for the I.T. department to ask for money for cybersecurity, she said.
Ramakrishna, the SolarWinds C.E.O., said that being expected to disclose every potential security vulnerability could make it easier for attackers to abuse them. “For one, it’ll be too many for the average investor to understand,” he said. “For another, I think we’ll be playing into the hands of the threat.”
Others argue that the threat of S.E.C. action could empower executives in charge of cybersecurity. Jake Williams, a security expert who consults with companies when they’ve experienced a data breach, said he regularly saw CISOs being asked to “paint a rosy or maybe rosier-than-aligned-with-reality picture.” But he added: “That practice, I think, died the day the SolarWinds lawsuit was filed by the agency. No CISO can now risk basically painting an unrealistically positive picture of cybersecurity.”

Harley Geiger is a lawyer who specializes in cybersecurity at the law firm Venable and is part of the team representing a coalition of tech companies including Cisco, Broadcom, Microsoft and Google. He said there were ways for CISOs to react to increased personal risk other than avoiding documentation of concerns and recommendations, including by erring on the side of escalating risks and vulnerabilities.
“They may want to be covered by a company’s insurance policy. They may want indemnification in their employment contracts,” Geiger said. “I think it would be the wrong message for or the wrong takeaway for CISOs to choose to ignore or not escalate material cybersecurity information.”
If generic disclosures aren’t enough, what is? Being too specific about vulnerabilities could give attackers valuable information, while being too broad isn’t valuable to investors. “The question,” Wolff said, “is can the S.E.C. define a clear middle ground.” — Sarah Kessler

Trump Media & Technology Group, the firm that runs Truth Social, has racked up big losses and may not survive without new funding, a regulatory filing this week disclosed. Truth Social has been pinning its future on a long-delayed merger with a shell company meant to take it public, giving it access to roughly $300 million in funding.

An A.I. pioneer on her life and science
When Fei-Fei Li, co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, showed the first draft of her book project to one of her colleagues, he told her to throw it away.
“He said that there’s a lot of scientists who can write about the ideas of technology,” Li told DealBook. But the colleague added that “my unique personal journey, as an immigrant, as a woman, as someone whose coming-of-age as a scientist is so intertwined with the coming-of-age of modern A.I., would give even those who are not traditionally in the world of tech a voice to identify with.”

Li persevered, and the book, “The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI,” was published this month, telling the story of the growth of A.I. and her own story as an immigrant from China who became one of the world’s leading experts in the field.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
What should a business leader take away from your book?
There’s so much debate and confusion and, frankly, anxiety around A.I. Part of the anxiety comes from not knowing what it is. Part of it comes from not knowing what it’s going to do. I hope this book sort of dispels both.
Tools are made by humans, designed by humans, used by humans. We have responsibilities as well as agency.
You write about the complex consequences of commercial investment in A.I. Can you tell me more about that?

At the beginning of my career, it was just pure scientific inquiry, curiosity. Nobody was paying attention. As A.I. became more powerful, as more resources from the industry poured into it, as its social impact was surfacing — it is a natural course of a profound technological change that it brings complexity.
Our ecosystem of innovation in America is hopefully driven by a combination of private sector, public sector and government. Right now, we have an imbalance. I’m hoping the public sector can still be a trusted source of evaluating and assessing and understanding and explaining this technology, but also be at the forefront of scientific discovery for the public good.
What risks are you most focused on?
I personally focus on societal risks, from disinformation to bias and privacy, infringement to job disruption, to weaponization.
I do think there is responsibility, especially for the media, as well as the government, to engage in this discourse responsibly. I’m concerned when the media is biasing their megaphones to very few voices that are much more hyperbolic, focusing on existential crises, rather than the real social risks that will deeply impact everyday people, especially people from underserved communities.
Is the government doing enough?
President Biden’s executive order was a good first step because it’s broad and relatively balanced. But that truly is a first step. What is really important is to have the humility, especially for policymakers and business leaders, to recognize that this is new. So learn about what this is before making policy.

DealBook readers respond: Sam Bankman-Fried
As crypto crime watchers know, Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Nov. 2 for his role in the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. The big question remaining: How long of a prison term will the 31-year-old get?
The maximum term is more than 100 years. Last Saturday, we asked DealBook readers what would be a fair sentence. Many respondents shared their view that the judge should not go easy on Bankman-Fried at the sentencing hearing, scheduled for March.
Here’s a selection of what readers had to say about Bankman-Fried, the American justice system and the wider cryptocurrency market:
“Perhaps because I am a former prosecutor, I believe white-collar criminals should be sentenced on a par with violent ones, or perhaps more severely because the societal impacts are generally broader and the mitigating factors (socioeconomic status, etc.) are less compelling.” — Ted Baker
“What about the crypto investors who got fleeced; how does locking him up help them? Retributive justice and rehabilitation don’t speak in any way to making the investors as whole as possible.” — Thomas Haible
“I think a factor is that crypto is primarily a fixation of gamblers. Call them traders. Call them investors. But they’re not. They’re bettors.” — Barry Morse

2023-11-19,"Talks at OpenAI to bring back Sam Altman, the artificial intelligence start-up’s recently ousted chief executive, continued into Sunday evening but there were disagreements over the makeup of the company’s board of directors, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
Mr. Altman, 38, spent the weekend waging a pressure campaign on the start-up’s four-person board of directors who ousted him on Friday afternoon, three people familiar with the matter said. The result was a groundswell of support from investors, employees and OpenAI executives.
Mr. Altman was at the OpenAI headquarters on Sunday afternoon. He posted a photo of himself on X, formerly Twitter, wearing a guest identification badge and wrote, “first and last time i ever wear one of these.”
The negotiations included a look at how the company’s board of directors might be reshaped if Mr. Altman returns as chief executive, two of the people said. Members of the board have not yet agreed to what a restructured board of directors might look like — nor is Mr. Altman’s reinstatement an inevitability, two of the people said.

Mr. Altman’s return would likely include major changes to the board and the company is currently evaluating candidates, according to two people familiar with the situation. Over time, the board’s structure could change to further reflect OpenAI’s evolution from a research start-up to a commercial entity with billions in revenue and enormous ambitions.
But Mr. Altman and the investors still want to retain voices from people who are concerned about the safety of A.I. along with other board members with expertise in technology and commercializing those products, the people said.
OpenAI’s unusual governance structure, which caps its profits, could change, while retaining the checks and balances the company built on the safety of its technology, the people said. The company’s priority is to get a viable board in place by Monday morning, the people said.
Down the line, Mr. Altman and his supporters want to have the company adopt a more traditional structure to reflect its growth into a business valued at $80 billion with many customers and constituents, the people said. They said the events since Friday had been a wakeup call that OpenAI’s structure no longer worked.
There has been a whirlwind of activity since Mr. Altman was forced out of OpenAI, a company he helped found eight years ago that has become one of the most closely watched companies in tech thanks to its popular ChatGPT chatbot.

On Sunday afternoon, Will Hurd, a former OpenAI board member and a former Republican congressman from Texas, was standing outside the company’s headquarters in San Francisco’s Mission district waiting for a ride to the airport after spending two days digging into the details of Mr. Altman’s dismissal.
Mr. Hurd said that a representative of the company had called him on Friday morning, before Mr. Altman’s removal, and asked for his help in navigating the leadership upheaval. Mr. Hurd traveled from Texas to San Francisco on Saturday.
“The industry is important, the company is important,” Mr. Hurd said. “This is the future. How do we make sure there’s a level of trust and transparency? All things we want from models, we want from governance.”
OpenAI declined to comment.
OpenAI’s board of directors has an atypical structure. The organization started as a nonprofit before transforming itself into a for-profit company and bringing on Microsoft as its biggest investor. The for-profit company still answers to the nonprofit board. As a result, the company’s investors have had no official say in what happens to the start-up or who leads it.
Before Mr. Altman was forced out, OpenAI had six board members, including Mr. Altman and Greg Brockman, a company co-founder and board chairman who quit on Friday in solidarity with Mr. Altman.

The other board members are Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI co-founder; Adam D’Angelo, the chief executive of Quora, the question-and-answer site; Helen Toner, a director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology; and Tasha McCauley, an entrepreneur and computer scientist.
Since Friday, people close to the company have been trying to learn why the board dismissed Mr. Altman. Brad Lightcap, the company’s chief operating officer, said in a note to staff on Saturday that there was no “malfeasance” involved.
OpenAI’s board did not tell investors, who have poured billions into the company, what Mr. Altman did wrong. Upon learning of news of his ouster, many investors began a push — in private communications and publicly via social media — to get the board to reverse its decision.
Many reached out to Microsoft, because it is OpenAI’s biggest shareholder and had the most leverage with the company.
The stalemate is the latest twist in a series of power struggles at OpenAI. The fight drew attention to a longtime rift in the A.I. community between people who believe A.I. is the biggest business opportunity in a generation and others who worry that moving too fast could be dangerous.

The company was recently in talks to raise a new funding round that would value the company at more than $80 billion. Bloomberg News earlier reported some of the details of the discussions.
Mr. Altman’s potential reinstatement would be a dramatic reversal for OpenAI, which said he had not been “consistently candid” in his discussions with the board when it unceremoniously ousted him.
As deliberations continued on Sunday, executives at OpenAI called in resources. At 12:45 p.m., a deliveryman with a dozen drinks from the Boba Guys chain showed up on a motorbike outside with two bags. Another deliveryman followed later with a half dozen more drinks.
At 6:15 p.m., a food delivery driver pulled up at the rear entrance and jumped out with four bags from McDonald’s. Two employees from OpenAI loaded them on carts and wheeled them inside for what looked to be a long night."
2023-11-20,"When Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, strolled into The Times’s San Francisco bureau last Wednesday morning, he looked carefree and relaxed — a happy mogul in an orange hoodie, riding a wave of success atop one of Silicon Valley’s hottest companies.
Mr. Altman was there to record an interview for the podcast I co-host, “Hard Fork,” and to discuss the roller coaster year he has had since the release of ChatGPT, the chatbot that took the world by storm and kicked off a generative A.I. boom.
None of us — Mr. Altman included — had any idea that two days later, he would be fired from OpenAI by the company’s board, or that his ouster would kick off one of the most dramatic sequences of events in recent Silicon Valley history.
Less than a week after our interview, everything has changed for Mr. Altman. He now plans to run a new advanced A.I. lab at Microsoft, along with his co-founder Greg Brockman, who quit OpenAI in solidarity. Almost all of OpenAI’s employees have threatened to go to Microsoft to join them unless the board reinstates Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman.
In our interview, Mr. Altman discussed the success of ChatGPT, his optimism about the future of A.I. and whether he is an “accelerationist” who believes that A.I. should progress faster.
We still don’t know the exact reason for the OpenAI board’s firing of Mr. Altman, but Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist and a member of its board who led the coup, reportedly took issue with Mr. Altman’s aggressive push for faster A.I. progress. And while Mr. Altman is no longer in charge of OpenAI, he’s still the biggest figure in A.I. today, and his views remain as relevant as ever."

If they had been the plot of a science fiction movie, or an episode of “Succession,” the events at OpenAI last weekend would have seemed a little over-the-top.
A secret board coup! Fears of killer A.I.! A star C.E.O., betrayed by his chief scientist! A middle-of-the-night staff revolt that threatens to change the balance of global tech power!
If you haven’t been paying attention to all the twists and turns in the saga, that’s OK. It’s been a confusing ride, with lots of complex jargon and hard-to-follow details.
But it’s an important story, even if you’re not particularly interested in A.I. If you’ve ever used ChatGPT or drawn a picture with DALL-E 3, or if you care about whether powerful A.I. systems might someday threaten human survival, all of that is wrapped up in the drama at OpenAI, the country’s most prominent maker of artificial intelligence.

Here’s what you need to know:
Why did this happen?
OpenAI’s board fired its chief executive, Sam Altman, in a surprise on Friday. The board’s explanation — that Altman had not been completely candid with them — was vague and opaque.
We still don’t know exactly what happened between Altman and the board. But OpenAI’s unusual governance structure — it is run by a nonprofit board that controls a for-profit subsidiary and can vote to replace its leaders — allowed the board to fire Altman without explaining itself."
2023-11-22,"What happened at OpenAI over the past five days could be described in many ways: A juicy boardroom drama, a tug of war over one of America’s biggest start-ups, a clash between those who want A.I. to progress faster and those who want to slow it down.
But it was, most importantly, a fight between two dueling visions of artificial intelligence.
In one vision, A.I. is a transformative new tool, the latest in a line of world-changing innovations that includes the steam engine, electricity and the personal computer, and that, if put to the right uses, could usher in a new era of prosperity and make gobs of money for the businesses that harness its potential.
In another vision, A.I. is something closer to an alien life form — a leviathan being summoned from the mathematical depths of neural networks — that must be restrained and deployed with extreme caution in order to prevent it from taking over and killing us all.
With the return of Sam Altman on Tuesday to OpenAI, the company whose board fired him as chief executive last Friday, the battle between these two views appears to be over.

Team Capitalism won. Team Leviathan lost.
OpenAI’s new board will consist of three people, at least initially: Adam D’Angelo, the chief executive of Quora (and the only holdover from the old board); Bret Taylor, a former executive at Facebook and Salesforce; and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary. The board is expected to grow from there.
OpenAI’s largest investor, Microsoft, is also expected to have a larger voice in OpenAI’s governance going forward. That may include a board seat.
Gone from the board are three of the members who pushed for Mr. Altman’s ouster: Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist (who has since recanted his decision); Helen Toner, a director of strategy at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology; and Tasha McCauley, an entrepreneur and researcher at the RAND Corporation.
Mr. Sutskever, Ms. Toner and Ms. McCauley are representative of the kinds of people who were heavily involved in thinking about A.I. a decade ago — an eclectic mix of academics, Silicon Valley futurists and computer scientists. They viewed the technology with a mix of fear and awe, and worried about theoretical future events like the “singularity,” a point at which A.I. would outstrip our ability to contain it. Many were affiliated with philosophical groups like the Effective Altruists, a movement that uses data and rationality to make moral decisions, and were persuaded to work in A.I. out of a desire to minimize the technology’s destructive effects.
This was the vibe around A.I. in 2015, when OpenAI was formed as a nonprofit, and it helps explain why the organization kept its convoluted governance structure — which gave the nonprofit board the ability to control the company’s operations and replace its leadership — even after it started a for-profit arm in 2019. At the time, protecting A.I. from the forces of capitalism was viewed by many in the industry as a top priority, one that needed to be enshrined in corporate bylaws and charter documents.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But a lot has changed since 2019. Powerful A.I. is no longer just a thought experiment — it exists inside real products, like ChatGPT, that are used by millions of people every day. The world’s biggest tech companies are racing to build even more powerful systems. And billions of dollars are being spent to build and deploy A.I. inside businesses, with the hope of reducing labor costs and increasing productivity.
Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.
The new board members are the kinds of business leaders you’d expect to oversee such a project. Mr. Taylor, the new board chair, is a seasoned Silicon Valley deal maker who led the sale of Twitter to Elon Musk last year, when he was the chair of Twitter’s board. And Mr. Summers is the Ur-capitalist — a prominent economist who has said that he believes technological change is “net good” for society.
There may still be voices of caution on the reconstituted OpenAI board, or figures from the A.I. safety movement. But they won’t have veto power, or the ability to effectively shut down the company in an instant, the way the old board did. And their preferences will be balanced alongside others’, such as those of the company’s executives and investors.
That’s a good thing if you’re Microsoft, or any of the thousands of other businesses that rely on OpenAI’s technology. More traditional governance means less risk of a sudden explosion, or a change that would force you to switch A.I. providers in a hurry.
And perhaps what happened at OpenAI — a triumph of corporate interests over worries about the future — was inevitable, given A.I.’s increasing importance. A technology potentially capable of ushering in a Fourth Industrial Revolution was unlikely to be governed over the long term by those who wanted to slow it down — not when so much money was at stake.

There are still a few traces of the old attitudes in the A.I. industry. Anthropic, a rival company started by a group of former OpenAI employees, has set itself up as a public benefit corporation, a legal structure that is meant to insulate it from market pressures. And an active open-source A.I. movement has advocated that A.I. remain free of corporate control.
But these are best viewed as the last vestiges of the old era of A.I., in which the people building A.I. regarded the technology with both wonder and terror, and sought to restrain its power through organizational governance.
Now, the utopians are in the driver’s seat. Full speed ahead."
2023-11-23,"One of the nice things about OpenAI is that it was built on distrust. It began as a nonprofit research lab because its founders didn’t think artificial intelligence should be pioneered by commercial firms, which are driven overwhelmingly by the profit motive.
As it evolved, OpenAI turned into what you might call a fruitful contradiction: a for-profit company overseen by a nonprofit board with a corporate culture somewhere in between.
Many of the people at the company seem simultaneously motivated by the scientist’s desire to discover, the capitalist’s desire to ship product and the do-gooder’s desire to do this all safely.
The events of the past week — Sam Altman’s firing, all the drama, his rehiring — revolve around one central question: Is this fruitful contradiction sustainable?

Can one organization, or one person, maintain the brain of a scientist, the drive of a capitalist and the cautious heart of a regulatory agency? Or, as Charlie Warzel wrote in The Atlantic, will the money always win out?
It’s important to remember that A.I. is quite different from other parts of the tech world. It is (or at least was) more academic. A.I. is a field that had a research lineage stretching back centuries. Even today, many of the giants of the field are primarily researchers, not entrepreneurs — people like Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton, who won the Turing Award (the Nobel Prize of computing) together in 2018 and now disagree about where A.I. is taking us."

2023-11-25,"Meta has received more than 1.1 million reports of users under the age of 13 on its Instagram platform since early 2019 yet it “disabled only a fraction” of those accounts, according to a newly unsealed legal complaint against the company brought by the attorneys general of 33 states.
Instead, the social media giant “routinely continued to collect” children’s personal information, like their locations and email addresses, without parental permission, in violation of a federal children’s privacy law, according to the court filing. Meta could face hundreds of millions of dollars, or more, in civil penalties should the states prove the allegations.
“Within the company, Meta’s actual knowledge that millions of Instagram users are under the age of 13 is an open secret that is routinely documented, rigorously analyzed and confirmed,” the complaint said, “and zealously protected from disclosure to the public.”
The privacy charges are part of a larger federal lawsuit, filed last month by California, Colorado and 31 other states in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit accuses Meta of unfairly ensnaring young people on its Instagram and Facebook platforms while concealing internal studies showing user harms. And it seeks to force Meta to stop using certain features that the states say have harmed young users.
But much of the evidence cited by the states was blacked out by redactions in the initial filing.
Now the unsealed complaint, filed on Wednesday evening, provides new details from the states’ lawsuit. Using snippets from internal emails, employee chats and company presentations, the complaint contends that Instagram for years “coveted and pursued” underage users even as the company “failed” to comply with the children’s privacy law.
The unsealed filing said that Meta “continually failed” to make effective age-checking systems a priority and instead used approaches that enabled users under 13 to lie about their age to set up Instagram accounts. It also accused Meta executives of publicly stating in congressional testimony that the company’s age-checking process was effective and that the company removed underage accounts when it learned of them — even as the executives knew there were millions of underage users on Instagram.

2023-11-26,"Inside the “blueberry muffin” conference room, the walls are, naturally, painted blue. Not just any blue — it’s the calming color you might find a baby’s bedroom, what the paint can refers to as “sea to shining sea.” Anchoring the room is a table, red and oblong, adorned with fake succulents in purple pots.
Nearby is the “fruity” conference room, with “razzle dazzle” red walls and vintage chairs upholstered in yellow pineapple printed cloth. Down the hallway is “maple waffle,” the room where the company holds its more serious meetings with investors. There, the walls are a subdued shade of brown.
This is the office of the cereal brand Magic Spoon, which was introduced in 2019 and, starting last year, called its roughly 50 employees back to in-person work, at least two days a week. At Magic Spoon’s SoHo space, which was designed right around the company’s return-to-office push, the conference rooms are meant to feel like cereal boxes.
“One of our core company values is, ‘Be a Froot Loop in a world of Cheerios,’” said Greg Sewitz, a Magic Spoon co-founder. “We wanted the office to underline that.”
Their space also reflects what designers, executives and workers describe as a trend that’s not entirely new, but is now becoming the go-to among certain start-ups, tech companies and other moneyed employers vying for young talent. It’s what might be called the Envy Office — what happens when companies try to combine the comforts of a living room and the glamour of a vacation. These spaces — often characterized by colorful walls, upholstered furniture and carefully curated coffee table books — lure workers in with plenty of opportunities to fill their social feeds with photos taken at the workplace.

2023-11-27,"When the secretive national security adviser of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, visited the White House in June, his American counterpart, Jake Sullivan, raised a delicate issue: G42, an artificial intelligence firm controlled by the sheikh that American officials believe is hiding the extent of its work with China.
In public, the company has announced its staggering growth with a steady cadence of news releases. They have included agreements with European pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca and a $100 million deal with a Silicon Valley firm to build what the companies boast will be the “world’s largest supercomputer.” Last month, G42 announced a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.
But in classified American intelligence channels, there have been more concerning reports about the company. The C.I.A. and other American spy agencies have issued warnings about G42’s work with large Chinese companies that U.S. officials consider security threats, including Huawei, the telecommunications giant that is under U.S. sanctions.
U.S. officials fear G42 could be a conduit by which advanced American technology is siphoned to Chinese companies or the government. The intelligence reports have also warned that G42’s dealings with Chinese firms could be a pipeline to get the genetic data of millions of Americans and others into the hands of the Chinese government, according to two officials familiar with the reports.
The C.I.A. even produced a classified profile of Peng Xiao, the chief executive of G42 who was educated in the United States and renounced his American citizenship for an Emirati one, U.S. officials say. The conclusions of the C.I.A. document about Mr. Xiao are unclear.
During the White House meeting in June with Sheikh Tahnoon and in other discussions of the past year, the Biden administration raised concerns about the company’s leadership and pushed for G42 to sever ties with Chinese companies and any agencies, according to a dozen people familiar with the discussions. The Americans have even pointed to the prospect of sanctions against the Emirati firm. The Biden administration’s concerns about G42 and its pressure campaign with the Emirates are being reported here for the first time.

2023-11-29,"The Walt Disney Company, bracing for a second proxy battle with the activist investor Nelson Peltz, reinforced its board on Wednesday.
James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, and Jeremy Darroch, who formerly ran Sky, a British television company, will join Disney’s board early next year, according to a securities filing. “Their appointments reflect Disney’s commitment to a strong board focused on the long-term performance of the company, strategic growth initiatives, the succession planning process and increasing shareholder value,” Disney said in a statement.
The board’s chairman, Mark G. Parker, who is the executive chairman of Nike, said in a statement that Mr. Gorman was “integral to Morgan Stanley’s well-managed succession process over the past year.”
Francis A. deSouza, a technology executive who has served on the Disney board since 2018, will not stand for re-election at Disney’s annual meeting in the spring, leaving the company with 12 directors.

While a search started in April, according to Disney’s filing, the board reinforcements were announced as multiple activist investors circle the company. Most notably, they include Mr. Peltz, who has been jockeying for multiple seats on Disney’s board and is aligned with Ike Perlmutter, a disgruntled former employee who is one of Disney’s largest independent shareholders. Mr. Perlmutter, who sold Marvel Entertainment to Disney in 2009, was pushed out of the company in March.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Representatives for Mr. Peltz and Mr. Perlmutter did not respond to queries.
“We have to obviously contend with them in some form,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said about activist investors earlier on Wednesday at the DealBook Summit. “I’m certain that the board will hear them out in terms of what their plans are, what their ideas are.”
Mr. Iger added: “I have a lot to do. I’m not going to get distracted by any of that.”
Last year, Mr. Perlmutter agitated — from his perch inside Disney — for Mr. Peltz to join the board. When he was rebuffed, Mr. Peltz started a proxy battle to put himself on the board, saying he would cut costs, revamp Disney’s streaming business and clean up the company’s messy succession planning. Mr. Peltz withdrew in February when Disney put in place a restructuring plan and cut $5.5 billion in costs. The cost-cutting ended up closer to $7.5 billion.
The pair re-emerged last month. They have been planning a new fight for board seats — the nominating window opens on Tuesday and runs until Jan. 4 — and have cited Disney’s languishing stock price as a reason. Disney shares closed on Wednesday at $92.50, an increase of about 13 percent from early last month but down about 48 percent from a March 2021 high.
Mr. Peltz has also faulted Disney for mishandling succession. After his contract was extended multiple times, Mr. Iger turned the company over to Bob Chapek in 2020. Two chaotic years later, Disney fired Mr. Chapek and reinstated Mr. Iger as chief executive. His current contract expires at the end of 2026, and he has said he will leave the company for good then.

Disney has said “robust” succession planning is underway, with a search extending outside the company.
Another activist investor, ValueAct Capital, has also amassed a large stake in Disney and sees the shares as undervalued. ValueAct, a fund in San Francisco that has taken stakes in companies like Microsoft, Spotify and The New York Times, is known for working with its targets and is not expected to fight for a board seat.

Elon Musk, the billionaire tech executive, stunned many with his blunt advice to advertisers who’ve fled his social media platform, X. He was interviewed by The Times’s Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times
“Is that clear?”
Andrew here. Yes, I was surprised at what Elon Musk said at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday — you can see that in the moment from our conversation when he left me temporarily speechless. But I would encourage everyone to watch the entire interview, as we covered so much more than that.
Coming into Wednesday’s DealBook Summit, few could predict what Elon Musk — whose SpaceX, Tesla and X are among the most consequential and talked-about companies in the world — would say. And the famously voluble billionaire delivered.
Yes, there was the moment when, using profane language, Musk denounced companies that had suspended advertising on X following his endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory. (He did try to clear the air, saying he hadn’t meant to support bigots. “I’m quite sorry” if he had encouraged them, he said.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But over a 90-minute conversation, Musk touched on much more, including what drives him, his fears about artificial intelligence and more.
“Don’t advertise.” Musk accused advertisers of trying to “blackmail” him over his remarks. (Bob Iger, Disney’s C.E.O., had said earlier that being associated with X and Musk was “not a positive” for his company.) After directing expletives at those businesses, Musk then cheekily added, “Hi, Bob, if you’re in the audience.” Linda Yaccarino, X’s C.E.O. whom Musk hired to win back advertisers (and who was at the summit), later posted a more conciliatory message.
“Do you want the best car, or do you not want the best car?” Whether people love Musk or hate him, the mogul boasted about the capabilities of Tesla vehicles and SpaceX rockets.
“A philosophy of curiosity.” Pressed on what drives him, Musk turned contemplative, speaking at length about a difficult childhood and how he has grappled with an existential crisis he first felt at age 12.

“I’m quite concerned that there’s some dangerous element of A.I. that they’ve discovered.” Asked about the recent leadership shake-up at OpenAI, which he co-founded before leaving in 2019, Musk said that he was worried about the speed at which it had been pushing innovation. He predicted that the technology could reach the point of problem-solving like the human brain — so-called artificial general intelligence — in less than three years. (Jensen Huang, the C.E.O. of the A.I. chipmaker Nvidia, reckoned that milestone would take at least a decade.)
“I think I would not vote for [President] Biden.” Musk, who has turned politically conservative in recent years, criticized the president for snubbing Tesla in the company’s green-energy initiatives, despite its leadership in electric vehicles. The billionaire also said that liberals tended to embrace censorship now, anathema to the self-described free speech “absolutist.” But when asked if he would then vote for Donald Trump, Biden’s likely Republican opponent, Musk demurred, saying only, “this is definitely a difficult choice.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Henry Kissinger dies at 100. One of America’s most powerful diplomats in recent memory, he helped reshape the world order during the Cold War, including by normalizing U.S. relations with China, brokering détente with the Soviet Union and negotiating the end of the Vietnam War. Kissinger was alternately lauded for his accomplishments and castigated for an approach that abandoned American values when deemed necessary.
The U.A.W. unveils its plan to organize nonunionized automakers. The United Automobile Workers union said it was courting potential union recruits at more than a dozen companies, including Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen, which together employ more than 150,000 workers. Separately, G.M. will cut spending at its Cruise subsidiary after pausing operations there amid concerns about the safety of its autonomous vehicles.
Disney adds two directors as activist investors circle. James Gorman, the outgoing C.E.O. of Morgan Stanley, and Jeremy Darroch, the former head of the British media company Sky, are joining the Disney board ahead of an expected fight with the financier Nelson Peltz. Disney said that Gorman would help with C.E.O. succession planning, a concern of Peltz’s.

Kamala Harris: “If I listened to polls, I would have never run for my first office or my second one, and here I am as vice president.”
The vice president conceded that the White House had “work to do” to convince voters before next year’s election that Bidenomics is working for them but dismissed polling that showed the Biden-Harris ticket trailing Trump in swing states. Harris pointed to the strong labor market and economic growth that outpaced most trading partners — revised G.D.P. numbers released on Wednesday showed the U.S. economy grew 5.2 percent last quarter — but she noted that stubbornly high inflation was weighing on American families. She also hit back at concerns about Biden’s age.
Jamie Dimon: “If you’re a very liberal Democrat, I urge you to help Nikki Haley, too. Give them a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump.”
JPMorgan Chase’s C.E.O. voiced his appreciation for Haley, the Republican presidential hopeful who has been gaining in the polls in recent weeks. When asked about the two front-runners, Biden and Trump, Dimon remarked “Oh god,” eliciting some awkward laughs from the audience. He also weighed in on the politics around so-called E.S.G. investing, vowing to “punch back” over Texas’s 2021 efforts to restrict the state’s business with financial firms that embrace environmental, social and governance policies.

Bob Iger: “I did not say they were for sale.”
The Disney C.E.O. spoke about the challenge facing the media giant, from streaming to politics and activist investors. But Iger denied that he was going to sell the company’s traditional broadcast television assets like the ABC network after suggesting he would consider doing so in July. He also addressed the company’s recent box office struggles, which some critics chalked up to audiences tiring of superhero sequels. He defended making the movies, but added that “there has to be a good reason to make them.”
David Zaslav: “The disruption to this business right now is harder and faster than we ever imagined.”
The Warner Bros. Discovery C.E.O. stood by the unpopular moves he has made at the media company, including a shake-up at CNN, firing his friends, shelving productions like the movie “Batgirl” for tax write-offs, and battling Hollywood writers and actors for months in two of the industry’s longest strikes.

The prolific producer and writer behind hits like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Bridgerton” said that taking in even great shows could “infect” her own work, and that she has been watching a lot of documentaries and reading. Rhimes also commented on the Writer’s Guild of America strike (she is both a writer and the C.E.O. of Shondaland, a production company). It “wasn’t complicated at all,” she said, adding, “I consider myself to be a writer first and foremost.”

And then he was reinstated, and so this whole thing seemed to have happened for nothing."
2023-12-02,"One day this summer, the internet personality Adin Ross switched on his camera and started broadcasting himself live to thousands of fans, sipping a Yerba Mate drink and nodding along to Lil Uzi.
Mr. Ross soon cut the music and started talking, assuring his fans that he would livestream Jake Paul’s upcoming boxing match, even though it would violate copyright laws. “I’ll pay the fines,” he promised them. Later, he streamed himself playing online slot machines and blackjack on a gambling site, Stake. Once, he streamed pornography. He has hosted Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist, and Andrew Tate, the online influencer known for his misogyny who faces human-trafficking charges. As Mr. Ross streams, his viewers post a torrent of messages in his channel’s chat feature — some celebrating him, some abusing him with slurs.
Welcome to life on Kick, the Wild West of livestreaming — where seemingly any kind of content goes. Since it went live late last year, the upstart platform has made waves in the world of livestreaming, long dominated by Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. Today, Kick has 21 million accounts, nearly twice as many as just four months ago, and has carved out a niche for itself as the latest home for the fringes of young male viewers who spend a significant amount of time online.
Kick, an Australian company, has flourished thanks to an unusual business model. It offers eyebrow-raising multimillion dollar contracts to top streamers and takes just 5 percent of all streamers’ earnings, compared with a 50-50 split on Twitch, helping lure away both top Twitch stars and rank-and-file content creators who say they’ve seen a bump in earnings. But the site itself is something of a loss leader for Stake, the online casino backed by the same ownership and frequently promoted on Kick. By offering them sizable endorsement deals with Stake, Kick has also attracted mainstream stars like the rapper Drake.

Until recently, Kick employed a laissez-faire approach to content moderation, which attracted controversial characters like Mr. Ross, who was banned from Twitch earlier this year. . Other streamers have filmed themselves committing apparent crimes, like trespassing and sexual assault.
To some streamers and viewers, Kick represents a welcome freedom from what they see as the draconian rules and corporate greed on Twitch, which is more closely moderated and in recent years has taken a greater cut of its streamers’ earnings. To others, Kick is allowing harmful views to thrive."
2023-12-03,"Artificial intelligence has been a breakout star in the opening days of COP28, the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Entrepreneurs and researchers have dazzled attendees with predictions that the fast-improving technology could accelerate the world’s efforts to combat climate change and adapt to rising temperatures.
But they have also voiced worries about A.I.’s potential to devour energy, and harm humans and the planet.
Exactly one year after the blockbuster debut of ChatGPT, the chatbot that introduced A.I. to hundreds of millions of people, the climate summit opened last week with a burst of events and announcements centered on A.I. technology. Many were stocked with representatives from Microsoft, Google and other power players in the emerging A.I. industry.
The hope for A.I. breakthroughs in the fight against rising global temperatures flows from the technology’s ability to process vast quantities of information. That allows it to produce insights and efficiencies that far exceed what computers and data scientists have been able to do, with a wide range of applications for climate.
The United Nations said on the summit’s opening day that it was partnering with Microsoft on an A.I.-powered tool to track whether countries are following through on their pledges to reduce fossil fuel emissions, helping to solve what has been one of the thorniest issues in international climate diplomacy.
Other groups offered research highlighting A.I.’s potential to reduce emissions in manufacturing and food production, help locate new renewable energy projects and balance electricity loads during extreme weather events.

Israel expands operations across Gaza
Israel widened its military campaign against Hamas in southern Gaza yesterday, with armored vehicles rolling closer to its main city and strikes pummeling urban areas.
Israel has signaled for days that it is preparing a ground invasion of the south, where it says Hamas fighters and commanders are hiding. The Israeli military said that its ground troops and air force “continued to operate across the Gaza Strip,” but did not offer details about the location of its operations. Here’s the latest.
Israel again told civilians to leave parts of Khan Younis, the area’s largest city, and head farther south including to Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Aid agencies, however, warned that the shelters in the south were already overcrowded.
“The level of human suffering is intolerable,” said the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, who visited Gaza on Monday. “It is unacceptable that civilians have no safe place to go in Gaza, and with a military siege in place there is also no adequate humanitarian response currently possible.”

Nuclear concerns: A Times visual analysis found that a rocket launched from Gaza on Oct. 7 hit an Israeli military base believed to house nuclear-capable missiles, although it’s likely they were not in danger.

2023-12-05,"On a recent evening in a dimly lit Japanese restaurant, nearly a dozen diners watched rapt from across the bar as a chef blowtorched a sliver of sturgeon until it was kissed with char. He topped the nigiri with crisped fish skin and a spoonful of caviar.
The quiet veneration from the customers, the practiced flick of the chef’s wrist and the buttery, bouncy pieces of fish might have suggested the meal was unfolding on a side street of Ginza.
The restaurant wasn’t in Tokyo, though. It wasn’t even in New York City or San Francisco — it was in a residential neighborhood of Sacramento, at a restaurant called Kru.
But the real surprise wasn’t the skill with which the sushi chef carved the tender fish, or how he draped it delicately over a quenelle of grains. It was its origin story. The sushi rice had come from Rue & Forsman Ranch, less than 40 miles away, and the sturgeon from even closer.

“Growing up in Sacramento, I had a chip on my shoulder,” said Billy Ngo, the owner and chef of Kru. “After high school, all my friends wanted to get the hell out; I stayed behind and worked, like, ‘No, Sacramento is cool — or it’s going to be cool.’ And it’s been really great to be part of that change.”"
2023-12-06,"This article is part of our special section on the DealBook Summit that included business and policy leaders from around the world.
The future is here, and for many in the media business, it’s terrifying.
In an effort to understand threats facing the media during the upcoming presidential campaign, I asked a technology firm in California to create a “deep fake” video of President Biden, the kind of inauthentic footage that could flummox journalists on Election Day.
The results were sobering. Within seconds, the company — which requested anonymity because of the controversial nature of the assignment — transformed my likeness into President Biden’s, using artificial intelligence technology and a snippet of video I recorded.
Every presidential election cycle in recent memory has been shaped by the emergence of a new technology or the exploitation of an existing one. But 2024 will be more complicated. In addition to threats posed by “deep fakes,” journalists will have to fight a battle for the truth on multiple fronts, grappling with tricky coverage of the criminal proceedings against former President Donald J. Trump and sagging trust in the news media.
“This will affect every aspect of American journalism, from how we operate our businesses to the new competitors that rise, to the new sources of fake or manipulated media that sprout and spread,” said Jim VandeHei, a co-founder of Politico and Axios. “Buckle up.”

2023-12-07,"Russia’s intelligence service has carried out a yearslong cyberattack campaign against high-profile politicians, civil servants, journalists and others, according to the British government, as part of what it called “unsuccessful attempts to interfere in U.K. political processes.”
The announcement, part of a joint action with allies including the United States, which announced related indictments and sanctions on Thursday, was intended to sound the alarm that Russia intends to sow chaos and doubt ahead of elections in the United States and Britain.
Britain’s Foreign Office, in a statement released on Thursday, said a group “almost certainly” linked to the Russian intelligence service engaged in sustained cyberespionage operations, including attacks that targeted lawmakers from across the political spectrum using spear-phishing attacks, or malicious emails, beginning as early as 2015.
The group also “selectively leaked and amplified the release of information in line with Russian confrontation goals, including to undermine trust in politics in the U.K. and like-minded states,” the Foreign Office said, drawing from an investigation from Britain’s intelligence agency.
Some of that information, including hacked trade documents between Britain and the United States, was leaked ahead of Britain’s general election in 2019.
Universities, journalists, the public sector, charities and other organizations were also targeted, according to the government, which warned that while Russia’s attempts to undermine democracy have been so far unsuccessful, they are likely to continue.

Wharton’s board of advisers this week called on Liz Magill, center, to resign as president of the University of Pennsylvania.

University leaders fail to assuage angry donors
The leaders of Harvard, M.I.T. and the University of Pennsylvania face increasing pressure after their disastrous testimony before Congress this week regarding antisemitism on college campuses. At issue: their legalistic responses on whether students calling for the genocide of Jews should be disciplined. (Liz Magill of Penn and Claudine Gay of Harvard later apologized for their testimony.)
Magill appeared the most vulnerable of the three as the school’s trustees debated her future — while the influential board of advisers at Wharton, the university’s business school, called on her to resign.
A firestorm over the testimony is growing in Washington and beyond. House Republicans announced an inquiry into the “learning environments” at the three schools, with the possibility of subpoenas. Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, said that the administrators’ “lack of moral clarity is simply unacceptable.”
Business leaders also expressed outrage. Ross Stevens, a hedge fund manager who has already criticized Penn’s curriculum, said he would withdraw a $100 million gift to the school. The billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who has publicly condemned Harvard students whom he said blamed Israel for the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, called for the presidents of all three universities to be fired.
And David Wolpe, a prominent rabbi, resigned from Harvard’s antisemitism advisory committee, saying that anti-Jewish ideology was so entrenched that he did not think he could make the kind of difference he had hoped for.

Penn “requires new leadership with immediate effect,” Wharton’s board of advisers wrote in a letter to Magill this week. While the board can only make recommendations, its voice is influential: Its chair, Marc Rowan of Apollo Global Management, has called on alumni to withhold donations to Penn. Moreover, three Wharton board members — David Blitzer of Blackstone, Jamie Dinan of York Capital Management and Alberto Duran of Mundivox Communications — are also Penn trustees.
It isn’t clear what the Penn trustees will do with Magill. During an emergency call Thursday, they didn’t vote on whether to oust her, instead urging her and other school leaders to express the university’s values with greater clarity.
But some on the Penn board suggested that further action was needed: Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a nonvoting member, urged fellow trustees to decide whether Magill’s testimony reflected the school’s values. “I expect they’ll be meeting again in the coming days, and I expect them to carefully weigh that question,” he told reporters.

The backlash against the Harvard and M.I.T. presidents hasn’t gone quite as far. Wolpe said that Harvard’s Gay was a “kind and thoughtful person” and stopped short of calling on her to resign. And M.I.T.’s executive committee said that Sally Kornbluth, the school’s president, had “our full and unreserved support.”
In related news: Sam Altman, the C.E.O. of OpenAI, wrote on X that he “was totally wrong” for saying that “antisemitism, particularly on the american left, was not as bad as people claimed.” He added, “i still don’t understand it, really. or know what to do about it.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Britain’s antitrust watchdog will review Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI. The Competition and Markets Authority said that it would begin to examine whether actions including Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in the maker of ChatGPT, which gave it a 49 percent stake in the company, represented an “acquisition of control” that amounted to a de facto merger. (Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said that his company’s relationship with OpenAI was “very different” from, say, Google’s takeover of the A.I. lab DeepMind.) The review is the most prominent effort yet to scrutinize the partnership between two leading A.I. developers.
Hunter Biden faces new tax evasion charges. A federal grand jury indicted President Biden’s son on Thursday, charging him with scheming to avoid paying federal taxes on millions in income from foreign businesses. This latest set of charges against Hunter Biden carries a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison if convicted.
Binance’s founder is ordered to stay in the U.S. before sentencing. A federal judge ruled that Changpeng Zhao was a flight risk, overturning a magistrate judge’s decision that the crypto magnate could return to Dubai, where his family lives. Zhao pleaded guilty last month to money-laundering charges as part of a wide-ranging settlement involving Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange.
A bankrupt trucking giant rejects a takeover bid. Yellow, which filed for Chapter 11 protection this summer, said that a proposal by a trucking executive to revive the business was “not viable.” Yellow added that the offer did not appear to have the backing of creditors, including the Treasury Department, which had extended a $700 million loan during the pandemic.
Nikki Haley continues to raise money from corporate leaders. Executives at Bain Capital and Solamere Capital will host a fund-raiser for the former South Carolina governor next week, according to Bloomberg, in the latest sign of Haley’s rise within the Republican presidential primary. Meanwhile, a super PAC backing Ron DeSantis canceled a donor event this week, reportedly because of a lack of interest.

The OpenAI director at the center of Altman’s ouster speaks
One of the central characters in the short-lived coup at OpenAI last month was Helen Toner, a researcher of artificial intelligence and a board member at the time who had clashed with Sam Altman, the company’s C.E.O.
A recap: Altman was fired and briefly hired by Microsoft; OpenAI employees — including the chief scientist who initially backed firing the C.E.O. — threatened to quit en masse; Altman was reinstated; and most of the board, including Toner, resigned. This all happened within five days.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Toner didn’t get into specifics, but said that the board’s loss of trust in Altman meant that firing him would fulfill the organization’s aim of developing A.I. in a responsible way:
At one point during the heated negotiations, a lawyer for OpenAI said the board’s decision to fire Altman could lead to the company’s collapse. “That would actually be consistent with the mission,” Toner replied at the time, startling some executives in the room.
In the interview, Toner said that comment was in response to what she took as an “intimidation tactic” by the lawyer. She says she was trying to convey that the continued existence of OpenAI isn’t, by definition, necessary for the nonprofit’s broader mission of creating artificial general intelligence that benefits humanity at large. A simultaneous concern of researchers is that AGI, an AI system that can do tasks better than most humans, could also cause harm.We’d like your feedback!

Ralph Nader’s top C.E.O.s
The consumer advocate Ralph Nader has made a career out of criticizing corporations and C.E.O.s and advancing laws to make food, water, work and travel safer. Now the 89-year-old lawyer has shifted gears: He’s singing the praises of exceptional business leaders.
Nader’s latest book, “The Rebellious C.E.O.: 12 Leaders Who Did It Right,” examines the work of executives he thinks did a good job when they ran their companies, including The Body Shop’s Anita Roddick, Patagonia’s Yvon Chouinard and Vanguard’s John Bogle.
The book itself is an example of Nader’s rebellious streak: He told DealBook’s Ephrat Livni that publishers had encouraged him to write about corporate malfeasance, but instead he wanted to highlight principled business leaders.
“Young people think C.E.O.s are just judged by whether they meet market demand,” Nader said in an interview. “This book raises the expectation level.”
The C.E.O.s he has profiled, he said, meet five criteria.

They focused on workers. “Herb Kelleher, the former C.E.O. of Southwest Airlines, always called workers ‘my people’ and he prioritized them even over consumers, but the result was cordiality and a culture of ‘yes’ among staff that consumers could really feel.”
They spoke their mind in public. “Often, C.E.O.s sound like they are speaking from a script and have marbles in their mouths. But those in the book didn’t hesitate to articulate their positions. Roddick of Body Shop was withering on the beauty industry.”
They admitted their mistakes. “They did that to hasten the corrective process. After saying they were wrong, they were quicker to fix problems.”
They weren’t overly secretive. “They all shared their so-called trade secrets and ways of doing business. They rebelled against the proprietary-secret syndrome that can often mask wrongdoing.”
They showed restraint. “All paid attention to profits and knew that without them they could not be bold or take risks. But they did not put profits above all else and they didn’t overpay themselves.”

2023-12-10,"The near implosion of OpenAI, a world leader in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, surfaced a conflict within the organization and the broader community about the speed with which development of the technology should continue and whether slowing it down would aid in making it safer.
As a professor of both A.I. and A.I. ethics, I think this framing of the problem omits the critical question of the kind of A.I. that we accelerate or decelerate.
In my 40 years of A.I. research in natural language processing and computational creativity, I pioneered a series of machine learning advances that let me build the world’s first large-scale online language translator, which quickly spawned the likes of Google Translate and Microsoft’s Bing Translator. You’d be hard pressed to find any arguments against developing translation A.I.s. Reducing misunderstanding between cultures is probably one of the most important things humanity can do to survive the escalating geopolitical polarization.
But A.I. also has a dark side. I saw many of the very same techniques, invented for beneficial purposes by our natural language processing and machine learning community, instead being used in social media, search and recommendation engines to amplify polarization, bias and misinformation in ways that increasingly pose existential threats to democracy. More recently, as A.I. has grown more powerful, we have seen the technology take phishing to a new level by using deepfake voices of your colleagues or loved ones to scam you out of money.
A.I.s are manipulating humanity. And they’re about to wield even more unimaginably vast power to manipulate our unconscious, which large language models like ChatGPT have barely hinted at. The Oppenheimer moment is real.
Yet “speed versus safety” is not the only red herring that obscures the real threats that loom before us.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, trudged across Washington today, making urgent pleas for quick approval of more aid for his country’s war against Russia. But in the meetings that mattered most — with Republican leaders whose allies hold the decisive votes — Zelensky’s pitch appeared to hit a brick wall.
After House Speaker Mike Johnson and several Senate Republicans met with the Ukrainian leader, they reiterated their stance that they would not agree to any new aid for Ukraine unless President Biden and Democrats in Congress bowed to their demands to clamp down on migration at the southern border of the U.S.
Biden, who also met with Zelensky this afternoon, said he was negotiating with Republicans and hopeful that they could come to an agreement over Ukraine aid. He warned Republicans that “Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine.”
Passing an aid package for Ukraine before the end of the year has become “practically impossible,” Mitch McConnell, the senator from Kentucky, said. And as my colleague Julian Barnes points out, Ukraine has been forced to persuade that the aid is needed and that it won’t go to waste on another failed counteroffensive.
“Vladimir Putin’s strategy was to outlast the West,” Julian said. “In some ways, this entire funding debate is about whether Putin’s theory of the case is correct.”

Nearly 200 countries pledged to transition away from fossil fuels as part of a compromised COP28 agreement reached today.

The global challenge of phasing out fossil fuels
The COP28 climate summit wrapped up a few hours ago with a compromise agreement that calls on nations to move away from fossil fuels.
But the deal still gives energy-exporting giants like Saudi Arabia plenty of leeway to continue drilling and presents countries and investors with the huge challenge of how to fund a green-energy shift over the next few years.
Here’s what’s in the pact: pledges by countries to wean their economies off fossil fuels in a “just, orderly and equitable manner” this decade; triple their uptake of renewables by 2030; restrict methane emissions; and halt carbon emissions entirely by midcentury.
It’s the first explicit agreement to curb fossil fuel use in the roughly three decades of such multinational negotiations. Scientists say drastic cutbacks are needed to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
John Kerry, President Biden’s special climate envoy, said he was “in awe of the spirit of cooperation” among negotiators. And Dan Jorgensen, the Danish minister for climate and energy, marveled that such an agreement could be reached at a summit hosted by the oil-rich United Arab Emirates.

Here’s what isn’t in it: tough language on outlawing construction of new coal-burning power plants and specific commitments to help finance poorer nations’ energy transitions. “Asking Nigeria, or indeed, asking Africa, to phase out fossil fuels is like asking us to stop breathing without life support,” said Ishaq Salako, Nigeria’s environmental minister.
Heading into the conference, there was deep skepticism among climate activists and scientists that the Emirates and other OPEC nations would try to water down any deal. And indeed, countries like Saudi Arabia were among those pushing back against efforts to craft a tougher pledge to fully phase out fossil fuels.
The deal is not legally binding. And some critics grumbled that it contained “cavernous loopholes” that would give countries producing fossil fuel incentives to continue oil exploration, including allowing room for “transitional fuels” like natural gas.
Investors didn’t appear worried about what the pledge might mean for the fossil fuel industry: Shares in Chevron and Exxon Mobil were up slightly in premarket trading on Wednesday.

Much work remains. One recent estimate suggests that trillions of dollars in investment is needed to transition to greener fuel sources like wind and solar and avert a climate catastrophe.
“We must transform the international financial system to pursue and achieve our climate goals,” Kerry told delegates. He added that policies were needed to encourage investment in green initiatives “and shift finance away from the things that put our shared prosperity at risk.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Congressional Republicans rebuff Ukraine’s pleas for more aid. Despite personal lobbying by Volodymyr Zelensky and President Biden, Republican lawmakers continue to insist that additional money and weapons to combat Russian forces must be paired with changes to U.S. border security. It’s unlikely that aid will come by year end, potentially imperiling Ukraine’s defense.
Bipartisan U.S. lawmakers call for further restrictions on trade with China. A House report said that Washington should take more steps to sever ties, including by revoking the low tariff rates that were granted to Beijing when China joined the W.T.O.
Netflix pulls back the curtain on its viewership. The streaming giant on Tuesday released audience numbers for over 18,000 titles, revealing its biggest hits in the first half of the year. (The winner: “The Night Agent,” which boasted 812 million watched hours.)

Defending global efforts to rein in Big Tech
As technology giants and its allies urge President Biden to push back against a landmark European Union law meant to curb the power of Big Tech, a group of progressive lawmakers are urging him to stand firm.
In a letter sent on Tuesday to Biden and shared first with DealBook, the legislators defended the Digital Markets Act from claims that it unfairly discriminates against U.S. businesses. “Big Tech companies are trying to squash competition by skewing the rules of digital trade to favor monopolies,” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the letter’s authors, told DealBook.

Silicon Valley argues that the E.U. law violates international trade rules. Tech companies and their lobbyists say the act overwhelmingly takes aim at American companies, with five of six so-called gatekeeper platforms subject to tougher regulations being U.S. firms. They also say it could undermine American efforts to maintain an innovation edge over China.
Amazon has appealed its designation and sought exemptions from parts of the law. And last month, Bytedance’s TikTok, Meta and Apple all filed challenges to the law. (Microsoft and Google said they would not fight their categorization.)

The progressive lawmakers dismissed those complaints. The group, led by Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, said that the law wasn’t targeting companies by national origin. Instead, it’s taking on American tech giants “because they have engaged in anticompetitive tactics.”
More broadly, the American lawmakers pointed to the millions that tech companies have spent fighting efforts to rein in their industry. They added that the tech industry’s attacks on the E.U. law seek to undermine Biden’s antitrust aims.
In other tech regulation news, here’s a reminder of the antitrust challenges that Google faces in the next year.
Musk’s problems on Earth, and above it
A move by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday to continue denying SpaceX’s Starlink nearly $900 million in federal funding is the latest blow to Elon Musk’s corporate empire. Yet that decision drew complaints by a Republican regulator that the Biden administration was setting government agencies against the billionaire’s businesses.
The F.C.C. again rejected Starlink’s request for broadband subsidies. The satellite internet provider had applied in 2020 for $885.5 million worth of federal money to provide service to remote U.S. communities. But the agency withdrew that money last year, after Starlink had agreed to provide service to 642,000 homes and businesses in 35 states.
Starlink, the agency ruled on Tuesday, “failed to demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service.” Among its concerns were failures in SpaceX launching its latest Starship rocket.

Republican F.C.C. commissioners disagreed, calling the decision unfair to Starlink by holding the company to unrealistic performance requirements. “What good is an agreement to build out service by 2025 if the F.C.C. can, on a whim, hold you to it in 2022 instead?” one, Nathan Simington, wrote in his dissent.
The other Republican commissioner, Brendan Carr, went further. In his dissent, Carr wrote that the F.C.C. was joining “the growing list of administrative agencies that are taking action against Elon Musk’s businesses,” pointing to a “pattern of regulatory harassment.” (Tesla is facing multiple government inquiries, including into its Autopilot driver monitoring system, while the S.E.C. is looking into Musk’s $44 billion takeover of what is now X.)
Musk posted on X that “companies that lobbied for this massive earmark (not us) thought they would win, but instead were outperformed by Starlink, so now they’re changing the rules to prevent SpaceX from competing.”
In a statement, Jessica Rosenworcel, the F.C.C.’s chair and a Democrat, said the agency had followed “a careful legal, technical and policy review” in denying Starlink’s request.
In other Musk news: X is expected to bring in just $2.5 billion in ad revenue this year, according to Bloomberg, after bringing in about $1 billion per quarter a year ago. It’s further evidence of big brands pulling back from the social network.
Ackman’s other dispute with Harvard
Harvard’s governing body is standing by Claudine Gay as the school’s president, despite calls to remove her over what critics called insufficiently robust denunciations of antisemitism. (It also cleared her of plagiarism charges raised by conservatives.) But it faulted her initial response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks.
The move is a partial rebuff of Bill Ackman, the hedge fund billionaire who has been among the loudest critics of Gay and Harvard more broadly. The Times spoke with Ackman about his unusual activist campaign against his alma mater. In a response to the article on the social media platform X, the financier detailed another grievance against the university.

Ackman is still upset about a 2017 donation to Harvard. He gave $10 million worth of shares in Coupang, a South Korean e-commerce giant that was then privately held, to the school to help it recruit the highly regarded economist Raj Chetty.
In 2021, the financier said he learned that Coupang was going public at a $50 billion valuation, which would value the Harvard gift at $85 million — only to find out that the school had sold the stock for $10 million back to Coupang:
Harvard had never told me that they had sold the shares. I was never offered the opportunity to buy the shares back for $10m or a higher price, which I would happily have done, had I known the University needed liquidity.
And the notion that Harvard needed $10m of liquidity in the context of a $50 billion endowment is on its face absurd. Any sophisticated investor should also understand that when a private venture-backed company is buying back stock, it is a bad idea to sell.
Ackman wants what he says he’s owed: the right to allocate the profit from that investment, $75 million, to a Harvard-related initiative of his choice.
In other university news: Marc Rowan, the private equity mogul who publicly demanded ousting Liz Magill as the University of Pennsylvania’s president, suggested that he wanted to help further overhaul the school’s governance. Scott Bok, who recently stepped down as the chairman of Penn’s trustee board, warned that “donors should not be able to decide campus policies or determine what is taught.”

2023-12-14,"In a faintly stilted tone and with slightly awkward grammar, the American-accented voice on YouTube last month ridiculed Washington’s handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, claiming that the United States was unable to “play its role as a mediator like China” and “now finds itself in a position of significant isolation.”
The 10-minute post was one of more than 4,500 videos in an unusually large network of YouTube channels spreading pro-China and anti-U.S. narratives, according to a report this week from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a security-focused think tank.
Some of the videos used artificially generated avatars or voice-overs, making the campaign the first influence operation known to the institute to pair A.I. voices with video essays.
The campaign’s goal, according to the report, was clear: to influence global opinion in favor of China and against the United States. The videos promoted narratives that Chinese technology was superior to America’s, that the United States was doomed to economic collapse, and that China and Russia were responsible geopolitical players. Some of the clips fawned over Chinese companies like Huawei and denigrated American companies like Apple.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Content from at least 30 channels in the network drew nearly 120 million views and 730,000 subscribers since last year, along with occasional ads from Western companies, the report found.
Some of the videos featured titles and scripts that seemed to be direct translations of common Chinese phrases and the names of Chinese companies, the report said. Others mentioned information that could be traced to news stories that were produced and circulated primarily in mainland China.
Disinformation — such as the false claim that some Southeast Asian nations had adopted the Chinese yuan as their own currency — was common. The videos were often able to quickly react to current events. Jacinta Keast, an analyst at the Australian institute, wrote that the coordinated campaign might be “one of the most successful influence operations related to China ever witnessed on social media.”
YouTube said in a statement that its teams work around the clock to protect its community, adding that “we have invested heavily in robust systems to proactively detect coordinated influence operations.” The company said it welcomed research efforts and that it had shut down several of the channels mentioned in the report for violating the platform’s policies.
Efforts to push pro-China messaging have proliferated in recent years, but have featured largely low-quality content that attracted limited engagement or failed to sustain meaningful audiences, Ms. Keast said.

“This campaign actually leverages artificial intelligence, which gives it the ability to create persuasive threat content at scale at a very limited cost compared to previous campaigns we’ve seen,” she said.
Several other recent reports have suggested that China has become more aggressive in pressing propaganda denigrating the United States. Historically, its influence operations have focused on defending the Communist Party government and its policies on issues like the persecution of Uyghurs or the fate of Taiwan.
China began targeting the United States more directly amid the mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019 and continuing with the Covid-19 pandemic, echoing longstanding Russian efforts to discredit American leadership and influence at home and aboard.
Over the summer, researchers at Microsoft and other companies unearthed evidence of inauthentic accounts that China employed to falsely accuse the United States of using energy weapons to ignite the deadly wildfires in Hawaii in August.
In a report in September, the State Department accused China of using “deceptive and coercive methods” to shape the global information environment, including the creation of fake social media accounts and even fake news organizations. Other research suggests that China has actively spread disinformation in Taiwan that the United States will eventually betray the island nation.

Meta announced last month that it removed 4,789 Facebook accounts from China that were impersonating Americans to debate political issues, warning that the campaign appeared to be laying the groundwork for interference in the 2024 presidential elections. It was the fifth network with ties to China that Meta had detected this year, the most of any other country.
The advent of artificial technology seems to have drawn special interest from Beijing. Ms. Keast of the Australian institute said that disinformation peddlers were increasingly using easily accessible video editing and A.I. programs to create large volumes of convincing content.
She said that the network of pro-China YouTube channels most likely fed English-language scripts into readily available online text-to-video software or other programs that require no technical expertise and can produce clips within minutes. Such programs often allow users to select A.I.-generated voice narration and customize the gender, accent and tone of voice.
Some of the voices used in the pro-China network were clearly synthetic. Ms. Keast noted that the audio lacked natural pauses and included pronunciation mistakes and occasional notes of electronic interference. Occasionally, multiple channels in the network used the same voice. (One group of videos, however, tried to dupe viewers into thinking a real person was speaking, incorporating audio such as “I’m your host, Steffan.”)
In 39 of the videos, Ms. Keast found at least 10 artificially generated avatars advertised by a British A.I. company. She wrote that she also discovered what may be the first example in an influence operation of a digital avatar created by a Chinese company — a woman in a red dress named Yanni.
The scale of the pro-China network is probably even larger, according to the report. Similar channels appeared to target Indonesian and French people. Three separate channels posted videos about chip production that used similar thumbnail images and the same title translated into English, French and Spanish."
2023-12-15,"More than two years after a California state agency accused the video game maker Activision Blizzard of fostering a work culture of sexual harassment and discrimination against female employees, the agency on Friday withdrew its allegations in a settlement with the company.
As part of the settlement, Activision agreed to set aside as much as $47 million to address accusations of pay disparity and discrimination in promotions for female employees. In total, the company agreed to pay about $54 million in the settlement.
In the agreement, the California Civil Rights Department and Activision Blizzard said that “no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations” about “systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard.” The settlement also said an investigation had not found evidence of wrongdoing by Activision’s board, its executives or its chief executive, Robert Kotick.
The move ends a long-running dispute between the State of California and Activision, which makes video games like Call of Duty, Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft. The company had repeatedly said the accusations about its workplace culture were false.
The case — and the pall it created over the company when it was filed in 2021 — was a factor that led Microsoft to seek to buy Activision because its stock had fallen. Microsoft completed the blockbuster $69 billion deal for Activision this year.
The original complaint from the California Civil Rights Department, which was then called the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, contended that the state had conducted an investigation into Activision and found that it “fostered a pervasive ‘frat boy’ workplace” and that female employees were “subjected to constant sexual harassment.”
At the time, Activision said the complaint included “distorted and, in many cases, false, descriptions” and was “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable state bureaucrats.”
The settlement agreement is subject to court approval and is expected to be filed in court early next week.
The settlement, signed by both parties, said Gilbert Casellas, a former chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, had conducted a review of Activision and found “there was no widespread harassment or recurring pattern or practice of gender harassment” at the company.
Activision agreed to set aside as much as $47 million to pay women who were employees or contract workers at the company from 2015 to 2020 who said they had received inequitable pay.
One of the California agency’s own expert witnesses had testified that when taking into account the seniority of the roles that women at the company held, he did not find a pay disparity. He said there was a disparity when not taking into consideration the rank of the employees.
Activision also agreed to hire an outside consultant to evaluate compensation, promotion policies and training materials as part of the settlement."
2023-12-16,"On Friday, the California state agency that accused the video game maker Activision Blizzard of fostering a culture of sexual harassment against women withdrew those allegations in a $54 million settlement with the company.
The California Civil Rights Department found that “no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations” about “systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard.”
As part of the settlement, however, Activision agreed to pay as much as $47 million to address accusations of pay disparity and discrimination. All female employees who worked at the company between 2015 to 2020 will be offered a kind of monetary relief; they will get paid based on a formula. The company maintains it has offered equitable pay.
It is a stunning reversal. In 2021, the state agency estimated that Activision’s liability was about $1 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. How the state agency went from accusing Activision of fostering a culture in which female employees were “subjected to constant sexual harassment” to withdrawing those claims a couple of years later isn’t clear.
Was it enforcement zeal? This all started with an anonymous complaint in 2018. That letter was followed by a lawsuit from the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2021 and shortly later another from the California Civil Rights Department, which was then called the Department of Fair Employment Housing. The state agency objected to the settlement reached in the E.E.O.C. case. And then finally came a scathing Wall Street Journal story about accusations that the company didn’t handle sexual misconduct allegations properly.
The journalist Matt Taibbi wrote about this investigation: “Corporate regulation often begins with an investigation and ends with a devastating headline, but California flipped the script.”

The settlement  leaves big questions unanswered. In a news release, the California Civil Rights Department declared victory, heralding the $54 million payout and stating that “California remains deeply committed to promoting and enforcing the civil rights of women in the workplace.” That the agency found no legal wrongdoing doesn’t mean it found no wrongdoing at all.
But the case utilized vast resources. The chief counsel at the agency was fired last year. And it all comes about a year after Microsoft, which presumably conducted its own due diligence, paid $69 billion to acquire the gaming company, whose shares took a hit after the allegations came to light.

Google’s antitrust gauntlet
Epic Games’s court victory over Google this week was a big antitrust blow for the search giant. The Fortnite maker had accused Google of illegally throttling competition using its Google Play store, and a San Francisco jury agreed. Google plans to appeal, but the legal fight is just one of a number of cases it faces next year.
Nico Grant, a technology reporter for The Times, covers Google. He talked with DealBook about how the cases could reshape Google’s business.

Apple mostly won a case similar to the one Google just lost, which was also brought by Epic. What explains the different outcomes?
Apple must be very happy it didn’t have to face a San Francisco jury! And that was the significant difference between the cases. A judge ruled in the Apple case.
It’s also notable that Apple has a closed system, in which it makes its own phones and software, so it doesn’t have the complicated relationships with other phone makers that Google does — partnerships that the jury found to be coercive and anticompetitive.
A judge will decide remedies in the Google Play case early next year. What potential changes could Google be ordered to make?
Google could be ordered to open up payment options in the Play Store, so that users can subscribe to apps directly with the developer that made them. The company could also be forced to open up the Android mobile operating system to a broader range of app stores. For instance, Epic would love to offer an app store to Android users.
In these scenarios, the company’s Play Store business could be much less profitable, because Google would collect fewer fees.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Would Apple have to adopt similar changes?
In Apple’s Epic case, a judge ruled that the company has to allow users to pay app makers directly, rather than Apple processing the payments and taking a cut. But that hasn’t gone into effect as we’re waiting to see if the Supreme Court picks up the case next year. It’s possible that both companies — Apple and Google — will have to offer customers more options for how to pay for apps, even if so far, they’ve taken different routes to get there.
Google faces two other big antitrust cases in the United States — one related to its search business and the other to its dominance in digital advertising. Which of the three cases has potential to impact Google’s business most significantly?
The search case. It concerns Google’s largest business, responsible for more than half of its revenue last year. Closing arguments won’t take place until May and the judge has said he doesn’t have any idea how he’ll rule yet. But if Google is found to have run afoul of antitrust laws in search, there could be very serious consequences. The Justice Department could ask for one of the platforms where it distributes its search engine, such as its Chrome web browser or Android operating system, to be spun off from the company.
Is the outcome in the Google Play case likely to affect rulings in other antitrust cases Google faces in the United States or in the European Union?
A legal expert I spoke to said the cases are so different from one another that this result is not necessarily representative. But it shows that Google isn’t invincible. And it will certainly motivate anti-Google lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic to push harder to replicate the result.

What made a Netflix hit?

“The Night Agent” topped Netflix’s list of most-watched programs in the first half of the year with 812 million hours viewed.

Netflix this week gave a peek into its black box, publishing viewing data for over 18,000 titles for the first half of the year. The streaming giant described it as a “big step” toward transparency, and despite its omissions — including whether viewers watched five minutes or an hour of an hourlong show — the release reveals more than what rivals like Disney have published.
Here are some of the most interesting stats to come out of the report, which covers 93.5 billion hours (or 10.7 million years) viewed:
Overall, Netflix originals accounted for 55 percent of hours viewed. The top-watched series: “The Night Agent,” with 812 million hours viewed, followed by Season 2 of “Ginny & Georgia” and the Korean series “The Glory.”
“Suits,” the USA Networks drama that became a global binge-watching phenomenon this year, accounted for 599 million hours across its nine seasons. (The show began running on Netflix in the summer, so the bulk of its views came after the report’s measured period.)
The top-watched productions didn’t have huge stars, who can significantly raise costs. The top-ranked star vehicle was “FUBAR,” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which came in 10th. Jennifer Lopez’s “The Mother” came in next at 14th.
That said, Netflix’s pricey partnerships with mega-producers are paying off. “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story,” from Shonda Rimes, ranked fourth with 503 million hours viewed.

2023-12-18,"When it comes to Christmas, your birthday or any other holiday that involves gifts, do you share ideas with family and friends about what you would like to receive? Or do you prefer surprises?
When you’re the one giving a gift, do you appreciate having as much direction as possible, or do you prefer to give something the person isn’t expecting?
In “All I Want for Christmas Is in This 18-Slide Presentation,” Alyson Krueger writes about the trend of teenagers showcasing the items they want for Christmas in PowerPoints. The article begins:
Every year, Michelle Miller-McNair asks her three children to make lists of what they want for Christmas. “They usually write it down on a piece of paper or send me a link to a website,” she said.
But this holiday season, Ms. Miller-McNair, a comedian in Mooresville, N.C., received something else: an 18-slide PowerPoint presentation with photos, links and QR codes. It was made by one of her daughters, McKinley.
“I worked on it some during school and also when I was at my friend’s house,” McKinley, 13, said. “It took me about two hours total.”
The slide show included Panda Dunks (black-and-white Nike sneakers), makeup and a necklace from Kendra Scott. She marked high priority items with stars. Before delivering her wish list to her parents one weeknight after dinner, she practiced going through her deck.
“I thought through what I was going to say for each slide,” McKinley said.
Her mother was impressed.
“She gave me reasons why she doesn’t just want these items, but she actually needs them,” Ms. Miller-McNair, 40, said. “She had these Uggs that are slide-on-slippers, and she said she needs to put them on when she gets out of basketball practice, so she doesn’t ruin her basketball shoes.”
Let’s hope Santa is tech-savvy. Kids have long been using Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides for gift requests and school projects, but this year’s lists seem more elaborate than ever, with links, photos, decorative themes and QR codes. A number of recent TikTok videos show teenagers taking their parents through their gift requests in meetings that resemble corporate sales pitches.

2023-12-19,"One of the first things I asked ChatGPT about, early this year, was myself: “What can you tell me about the writer Vauhini Vara?” It told me I’m a journalist (true, though I’m also a fiction writer), that I was born in California (false) and that I’d won a Gerald Loeb Award and a National Magazine Award (false, false).
After that, I got in this habit of inquiring about myself often. Once, it told me Vauhini Vara was the author of a nonfiction book called “Kinsmen and Strangers: Making Peace in the Northern Territory of Australia.” That, too, was false, but I went with it, responding that I had found the reporting to be “fraught and difficult.”
“Thank you for your important work,” ChatGPT said.
Trolling a product hyped as an almost-human conversationalist, tricking it into revealing its essential bleep-bloopiness, I felt like the heroine in some kind of extended girl-versus-robot power game.
Different forms of artificial intelligence have been in use for a long time, but ChatGPT’s unveiling toward the end of last year was what brought A.I., quite suddenly, into our public consciousness. By February, ChatGPT was, by one metric, the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Our first encounters revealed these technologies as extremely eccentric — recall Kevin Roose’s creepy conversation with Microsoft’s A.I.-powered Bing chatbot, which, in the space of two hours, confided that it wanted to be human and was in love with him — and often, as in my experience, extremely wrong.

A lot happened in A.I. since then: Companies went beyond the basic products of the past, introducing more sophisticated tools like personalized chatbots, services that can process photos and sound alongside text and more. The rivalry between OpenAI and more established tech companies became more intense than ever, even as smaller players gained traction. Governments in China, Europe and the United States took major steps toward regulating the technology’s development while trying not to cede competitive ground to other nations’ industries.

But what distinguished the year, more than any single technological, business or political development, was the way A.I. insinuated itself into our daily lives, teaching us to regard its flaws — creepiness, errors and all — as our own while the companies behind it deftly used us to train up their creation. By May, when it came out that lawyers had used a legal brief that ChatGPT had filled with references to court decisions that didn’t exist, the joke, like the $5,000 fine the lawyers were ordered to pay, was on them, not the technology. “It’s embarrassing,” one of them told the judge."
2023-12-20,"The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday proposed sweeping changes to bolster the key federal rule that has protected children’s privacy online, in one of the most significant attempts by the U.S. government to strengthen consumer privacy in more than a decade.
The changes are intended to fortify the rules underlying the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, a law that restricts the online tracking of youngsters by services like social media apps, video game platforms, toy retailers and digital advertising networks. Regulators said the moves would “shift the burden” of online safety from parents to apps and other digital services while curbing how platforms may use and monetize children’s data.
The proposed changes would require certain online services to turn off targeted advertising by default for children under 13. They would prohibit the online services from using personal details like a child’s cellphone number to induce youngsters to stay on their platforms longer. That means online services would no longer be able to use personal data to bombard young children with push notifications.
The proposed updates would also strengthen security requirements for online services that collect children’s data as well as limit the length of time online services could keep that information. And they would limit the collection of student data by learning apps and other educational-tech providers, by allowing schools to consent to the collection of children’s personal details only for educational purposes, not commercial purposes.
“Kids must be able to play and learn online without being endlessly tracked by companies looking to hoard and monetize their personal data,” Lina M. Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement on Wednesday. She added, “By requiring firms to better safeguard kids’ data, our proposal places affirmative obligations on service providers and prohibits them from outsourcing their responsibilities to parents.”

2023-12-22,"Apple has opened negotiations in recent weeks with major news and publishing organizations, seeking permission to use their material in the company’s development of generative artificial intelligence systems, according to four people familiar with the discussions.
The technology giant has floated multiyear deals worth at least $50 million to license the archives of news articles, said the people with knowledge of talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The news organizations contacted by Apple include Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker; NBC News; and IAC, which owns People, The Daily Beast and Better Homes and Gardens.
The negotiations mark one of the earliest examples of how Apple is trying to catch up to rivals in the race to develop generative A.I., which allows computers to create images and chat like a human. The technology, which artificial intelligence experts refer to as neural networks, is built by using troves of photos or digital text to recognize patterns. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, a computer can learn to recognize a cat.
Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Meta and other companies have released chatbots and other products built with the technology. The tools could change the way people work and generate billions of dollars in sales.

But Apple has been absent from the public discussion of A.I. Its virtual assistant, Siri, has remained largely stagnant in the decade since its release.
A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. During a call with analysts last month, Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, said Apple has work “going on” connected to A.I. but declined to elaborate."

2023-12-26,"Twelve months ago, Tom Lee bet that 2023 was going to turn out just fine.
While many of his peers on Wall Street were sounding the alarm over an impending economic downturn, Mr. Lee, a stock market strategist who spent more than a decade running J.P. Morgan’s equity research before setting up his own firm, forecast in December 2022 that falling inflation and economic resilience would buck the broadly bearish mood.
Mr. Lee was right. Despite political brinkmanship over the nation’s debt ceiling, a banking crisis in March, fears over the cost of funding the government’s fiscal deficit, a continuing war in Ukraine and fresh conflict in Israel, the core of Mr. Lee’s prediction came to fruition in 2023. Inflation has fallen, unemployment remains low, and the S&P 500 has risen 25 percent.
Most investors disagreed with Mr. Lee’s prognosis; in 2023, they pulled more than $70 billion out of funds that buy U.S. stocks, according to data from EPFR Global. Only a quarter of fund managers whose performance is benchmarked to the S&P 500 have beaten the index’s returns this year, according to Morningstar Direct.
“2023 was a year that people were so convinced we would have a recession and they looked at everything through that lens,” said Mr. Lee, head of research for Fundstrat. “Then there were folks like us that said we don’t know the future but there is little evidence a recession is coming.”
Heading into 2024, prognosticators tracked by Bloomberg share Mr. Lee’s optimism more broadly, including analysts at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Binky Chadha, an equity strategist at Deutsche Bank who bet against the consensus with Mr. Lee last year, is also predicting that the bull rally will continue.
At the same time, analysts at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and others maintain that the absence of a severe downturn in 2023 doesn’t mean it has been avoided altogether, since the full effect of higher interest rates is still working through the economy.

The Michigan Supreme Court upheld an appeals court decision that found that Donald Trump could appear on the ballot despite questions about his eligibility to hold elected office because of his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.
The decision followed a bombshell ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court, which on Dec. 19 determined that Trump should be removed from the state’s primary ballot for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. A key difference between the decisions was that Colorado’s came after a trial that established an evidentiary basis to find that Trump incited a violent uprising. Lawyers in Michigan wanted a similar trial, but the courts turned them down.
The question of Trump’s eligibility is widely expected to be answered by the U.S. Supreme Court, and some form of challenge has been lodged in more than 30 states. Many of those have already been dismissed, and officials in some states, including California, have signaled that they are wary of trying to have him removed.
Michigan’s primary will be held Feb. 27.

Get it sent to your inbox.
We’re using today’s newsletter to highlight a selection of the best Times Opinion coverage of the year, as chosen by the department’s editors.
As Katie Kingsbury, who runs Times Opinion, wrote to us:
What I’ve always admired about The Times’s readers is that they don’t expect our opinion journalism to tell them what to think. They’re not looking to have their views affirmed or their understanding reflected back to them. What readers want of us in Opinion is — as best we can — to surprise them, delight them, engage them and, ultimately, to help them to think for themselves.
We try to do that every day by inviting intelligent discussion by informed people. In 2023, it meant offering 100-plus years of experience covering the Middle East from columnists such as Tom Friedman and Bret Stephens. Closer to home, colleagues like Maureen Dowd, Carlos Lozada, Jamelle Bouie and David French challenged conventional wisdom on American politics and policy, while Lydia Polgreen, Charles Blow and David Brooks asked essential questions about what society values and how to live a full life. Penetrating essays, poignant films and startling visuals by outside contributors only bolstered the Opinion report this past year.
We hope you enjoy the selection.
Standout columns
Charles Blow on coming out late in life.
Jamelle Bouie on Chief Justice John Roberts’s polite disdain for Congress.
David Brooks on his friend’s suicide.

2023-12-29,"For months, some of the biggest players in the U.S. media industry have been in confidential talks with OpenAI on a tricky issue: the price and terms of licensing their content to the artificial intelligence company.
The curtain on those negotiations was pulled back this week when The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, alleging that the companies used its content without permission to build artificial intelligence products.
The Times said that before suing, it had been talking with the companies for months about a deal. And it was not alone. Other news organizations — including Gannett, the largest U.S. newspaper company; News Corp, the owner of The Wall Street Journal; and IAC, the digital colossus behind The Daily Beast and the magazine publisher Dotdash Meredith — have been in talks with OpenAI, said three people familiar with the negotiations, who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential talks.
The News/Media Alliance, which represents more than 2,200 news organizations in North America, has also been talking with OpenAI about coming up with a framework for a deal that would suit its members, a person familiar with the talks said.

Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s biggest investor and is incorporating OpenAI’s technology into its products, has held talks as well. “We’ve had thoughtful conversations with a number of publishers, and look forward to future discussions,” said Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft.
Companies like OpenAI and Microsoft have sought licensing deals with news organizations to train A.I. systems that can produce humanlike prose. Those systems in turn power applications like chatbots, from which the companies can gain revenue."
2023-12-30,"The boom in artificial intelligence tools that draw on troves of content from across the internet has begun to test the bounds of copyright law.
Authors and a leading photo agency have brought suit over the past year, contending that their intellectual property was illegally used to train A.I. systems, which can produce humanlike prose and power applications like chatbots.
Now they have been joined in the spotlight by the news industry. The New York Times filed a lawsuit on Wednesday accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of copyright infringement, the first such challenge by a major American news organization over the use of artificial intelligence.
The lawsuit contends that OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing Chat can produce content nearly identical to Times articles, allowing the companies to “free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products without permission or payment.”
OpenAI and Microsoft have not had an opportunity to respond in court. But after the lawsuit was filed, those companies noted that they were in discussions with a number of news organizations on using their content — and, in the case of OpenAI, had begun to sign deals.
Without such agreements, the limits may be worked out in the courts, with significant repercussions. Data is crucial to developing generative A.I. technologies — which can generate text, images and other media on their own — and to the business models of companies doing that work."
