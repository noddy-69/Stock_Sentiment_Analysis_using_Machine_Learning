Apple is still worth more.
Apple, the computer company that started in a California garage in 1976, is now worth $3 trillion. It became the first publicly traded company to ever reach the figure on Monday, when its stock briefly eclipsed $182.86 a share before closing at $182.01.
Apple’s value is even more remarkable considering how rapid its recent ascent has been. In August 2018, Apple became the first American company ever to be worth $1 trillion, an achievement that took 42 years. It surged past $2 trillion two years later. Its next trillion took just 16 months and 15 days.
Such a valuation would have been unfathomable a few years ago. Now it seems like another milepost for a corporate titan that is still growing and appears to have few tall hurdles in its path. Another tech giant, Microsoft, could follow Apple into the $3 trillion club early this year.

“When we started, we thought it would be a successful company that would go forever. But you don’t really envision this,” said Steve Wozniak, the engineer who founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976. “At the time, the amount of memory that would hold one song cost $1 million.”
By just about any measure, a $3 trillion valuation is striking. It is worth more than the value of all of the world’s cryptocurrencies. It is roughly equal to the gross domestic product of Britain or India. And it is equivalent to about six JPMorgan Chases, the biggest American bank, or 30 General Electrics.
Apple now accounts for nearly 7 percent of the total value of the S&P 500, breaking IBM’s record of 6.4 percent in 1984, according to Howard Silverblatt, an analyst who tracks valuations at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple alone is about 3.3 percent of the value of all global stock markets, he said.
Behind Apple’s ascent is its tight grip on consumers, an economy that has especially favored its business and its stock, and its shrewd use of an enormous pile of cash.
When Apple unveiled the iPhone in January 2007, the company was worth $73.4 billion. Fifteen years later, the iPhone, already one of history’s best-selling products, continues to post impressive growth. In the year ending in September, iPhone sales were $192 billion, up almost 40 percent from the year prior.

The pandemic also sent sales of other Apple devices soaring, as people used them more to work, study and socialize, and sent investors fleeing to the safety of Apple’s stock in an increasingly uncertain global economy.

Apple’s immense sales and wide profit margins have provided it with a stockpile of cash big enough to buy a company like UPS, Starbucks or Morgan Stanley outright. At the end of September, Apple reported $190 billion in cash and investments.
“They’ve created the greatest cash machine in history,” said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor who has studied Apple.
Yet instead of making a major acquisition, or even trying something ambitious and expensive like building multiple factories in the United States, Apple has decided to largely give its cash back to its investors by buying its own stock.

Over the past decade, Apple has purchased $488 billion of its own shares, by far the most of any company, according to an analysis by Mr. Silverblatt. Much of that spending came after Apple used a 2017 tax law to move most of the $252 billion it had held abroad back to the United States. Apple is now responsible for 14 of the 15 largest stock buybacks in any single financial quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said. “They are the poster child,” he said.
An Apple spokesman said the company has spent more than $82 billion on research and development over the past five years, steadily increasing its investment each year, and that it employs about 154,000 people, or 38,000 more than five years ago.
Apple is also the largest taxpayer in the United States. In April, the company said it had paid $45 billion in taxes over the prior five years.
Economists are split over buybacks. Some economists say companies with excess cash should return the money to its shareholders. That it is far better for the economy than sitting on billions of dollars in cash, they say.
“This whole notion that buybacks are somehow going into a black hole is mystifying,” Mr. Damodaran said. “That is cash going to investors.”

Other economists say that buybacks are largely designed to increase a company’s valuation and that the money should instead be used to invest in the business, raise wages or even cut prices.
Apple, for instance, has spent billions of dollars buying its own stock while also using low-wage workers to assemble its products, working hard to avoid taxes and tariffs, and continually raising the prices on its devices.
“Apple could have gone and used that money to do all sorts of things. Instead, they’re using it to boost their stock price,” said William Lazonick, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts who has been a leading critic of buybacks since the 1980s.
Mr. Lazonick said that buybacks increase stock prices by encouraging investors to buy, and then causing momentum in the stock market as other investors look to cash in on the increase.
Stock buybacks reduce the number of total shares available for purchase. That makes each remaining share more valuable and improves the underlying fundamentals of the company in equations that large investors and automated trading systems use to pick stocks. As a result, the stock price climbs higher.

To Mr. Lazonick, a $3 trillion valuation is the result of a mix of factors. “It’s impossible to know how much of that is speculation, how much is manipulation and how much is innovation,” he said.

2022-01-04,"On Christmas morning, I woke up early and flipped on CNN, where I found the newscaster toggling among three news stories — two really depressing ones and an amazingly uplifting one.
The first depressing story was the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. The other was the looming anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Both the threat from the virus and the distorted beliefs about the attack on the Capitol were being fueled by crackpot conspiracy theories circulated by Facebook, Fox News and Republican politicians.
But then there it was — sandwiched between these two disturbing tales — a remarkable story of U.S. and global collaboration to reach a new scientific frontier.
It was the launch at 7:20 a.m. Christmas Day of the James Webb Space Telescope. According to NASA, “thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians” — from 306 universities, national labs and companies, primarily in the U.S., Canada and Europe — contributed “to design, build, test, integrate, launch and operate Webb.”

Thank you, Santa! What a gift to remind us that a level of trust to do big, hard things together is still alive on planet Earth. By operating from deep in space, Smithsonian magazine noted, “Webb will help scientists understand how early galaxies formed and grew, detect possible signatures of life on other planets, watch the birth of stars, study black holes from a different angle and likely discover unexpected truths.”
I love that phrase — unexpected truths. We have launched a space telescope that can peer far into the universe to discover — with joy — unexpected truths.

Alas, though, my joy is tempered by those two other stories, by the fact that here on Earth, in America, one of our two national parties and its media allies have chosen instead to celebrate and propagate alternative facts.
This struggle between those seeking unexpected truths — which is what made us great as a nation — and those worshiping alternative facts — which will destroy us as a nation — is THE story on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurgency, and for the coming year. Many people, particularly in the American business community, are vastly underestimating the danger to our constitutional order if this struggle ends badly.

If the majority of G.O.P. lawmakers continue to bow to the most politically pernicious “alternative fact” — that the 2020 election was a fraud that justifies empowering Republican legislatures to override the will of voters and remove Republican and Democratic election supervisors who helped save our democracy last time by calling the election fairly — then America isn’t just in trouble. It is headed for what scientists call “an extinction-level event.”
Only it won’t be a comet hurtling past the Webb telescope from deep space that destroys our democracy, as in the new movie “Don’t Look Up.”
No, no — it will be an unraveling from the ground up, as our country, for the first time, is unable to carry out a peaceful transfer of power to a legitimately elected president. Because if Donald Trump and his flock are able in 2024 to execute a procedural coup like they attempted on Jan. 6, 2021, Democrats will not just say, “Ah shucks, we’ll try harder next time.” They will take to the streets.
Right now, though, too many Republicans are telling themselves and the rest of us: “Don’t look up! Don’t pay attention to what is unfolding in plain sight with Trump & Company. Trump won’t be the G.O.P.’s candidate in 2024.”
Who will save us?
God bless Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the two Republican House members participating on the Jan. 6 investigation committee. But they are not enough. Kinzinger is retiring and the G.O.P. leadership, on Trump’s orders, is trying to launch Cheney into deep space.

I think our last best hope is the leadership of the U.S. business community, specifically the Business Roundtable, led by General Motors C.E.O. Mary Barra, and the Business Council, led by Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella. Together those two groups represent the roughly 200 most powerful companies in America, with 20 million employees. Although formally nonpartisan, they lean center-right — but the old center-right, the one that believed in the rule of law, free markets, majority rule, science and the sanctity of our elections and constitutional processes.
Collectively, they are the only responsible force left with real leverage on Trump and the Republican lawmakers doing his bidding. They need to persuade their members — now — not to donate a penny more to any local, state or national candidate who has voted to dismantle the police or dismantle the Constitution.
Yes, that’s false equivalency. Nothing is as big as the Trump cult’s threat to our constitutional order. But it’s still relevant. For a lot of Americans, watching a smash-and-grab gang ransack their local mall and violent crime jump — and then seeing the far-left trying to delegitimize, defund or dismantle their police — is just as frightening as those trying to dismantle their Constitution on the Capitol mall.

I believe there are many Americans in the center-left and center-right who vigorously oppose both, and they think it’s a disgrace when progressives tell them not to worry about the first or when Trumpers tell them not to worry about the second.

When you take both seriously, many more people will listen to you on both. Individually, in their hometowns — like mine, Minneapolis — business leaders have effectively pushed back on dismantling the police. Now it is time for America’s business leaders to just as forcefully push back on the Trump Republicans trying to dismantle the Constitution.
Why should they risk alienating pro-Trump lawmakers who soon may control both the House and the Senate? Besides love of country?
Let me put it crassly: Civil wars are not good for business. I lived inside one in Lebanon for four years. Corporate America shouldn’t be lulled by 2021’s profits, because once a country’s institutions, laws, norms and unstated redlines are breached — and there is no more truth, only versions, and no more trust, only polarization — getting them back is almost impossible.
Can’t happen here? It sure can.
Rick Wilson, a longtime G.O.P. strategist opposed to Trump, recently described to The Washington Post what will happen if the campaign by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and other Trump cultists succeeds to get more Big Lie promoters elected in 2022 — and the G.O.P. takes the House or Senate or both: “We’re looking at a nihilistic Mad Max hellscape. It will be all about the show of 2024 to bring Donald Trump back into power.” He added, “They will impeach Biden, they will impeach Harris, they will kill everything.”
So what will big business do? I wish I were more optimistic.
CNBC reported Monday that data compiled by the watchdog group Accountable.US “shows that political action committees of top corporations and trade groups — including the American Bankers Association, Boeing, Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin and General Motors — continued to give to the Republican election objectors.”

Kyle Herrig, president of Accountable.US, said in a statement: “Major corporations were quick to condemn the insurrection and tout their support for democracy — and almost as quickly, many ditched those purported values by cutting big checks to the very politicians that helped instigate the failed coup attempt. The increasing volume of corporate donations to lawmakers who tried to overthrow the will of the people makes clear that these companies were never committed to standing up for democracy in the first place.”
The leaders of these companies are totally underestimating the chances that our democratic institutions will unravel. And if American democracy unravels, the whole world becomes unstable. That will not exactly be good for business, either.
Neutrality is not an option anymore. As Liz Cheney put it on Sunday: “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both.”
So, my New Year’s wish is that item one on the agenda for the next meetings of both the Business Roundtable and the Business Council will be: Which side are we on?

2022-01-05,"After nearly three years as the editor in chief of Slate, the online publication and podcasting platform, Jared Hohlt is stepping down, a spokeswoman for the site said on Wednesday.
Slate’s chief executive, Dan Check, told the staff in an email that, after recent discussions with Mr. Hohlt about the 26-year-old outlet, “we both decided this move was the best way forward.” Mr. Hohlt, who was an editor at New York magazine for nearly two decades before he joined Slate, declined to comment. His last day will be Friday, a spokeswoman said.
He started as editor in chief in April 2019, succeeding Julia Turner, who had joined The Los Angeles Times, where she is deputy managing editor for entertainment, audio and strategy, and Lowen Liu, a Slate deputy editor who was the acting editor in chief after Ms. Turner’s departure.
Mr. Hohlt inherited a site in flux: Jacob Weisberg, a former Slate editor in chief who had become chief executive of the Slate Group, left in 2018 to found a podcasting company, Pushkin Industries, with the journalist Malcolm Gladwell.
Mr. Hohlt led Slate’s newsroom during a rocky moment for first- and second-generation online publications. The bet that many of them had made to rely mainly on advertising revenue had essentially failed to pay off.

The digital giants Vox Media and Group Nine announced a merger last month, part of their effort to compete for advertising dollars with Google, Facebook and Amazon. BuzzFeed recently acquired HuffPost and Complex Networks, but failed to raise the capital it had hoped to bring in after going public last month.
Some digital publications, including Slate, have instituted paywalls to raise revenue from readers. In September, Slate announced layoffs and other cost-cutting measures.
Mr. Hohlt “shaped and sharpened pieces and podcast episodes,” Mr. Check said in his email to the staff, adding that he was “a great leader, teammate and a pleasure to work with.” The Slate spokeswoman declined to comment on who would lead the newsroom after Mr. Hohlt’s departure.

Slate was introduced in 1996 by Microsoft under the novel concept of a magazine whose articles would be published solely on the World Wide Web. “One of Slate’s main goals is to demonstrate, if we can, that the economies of cyberspace make it easier for our kind of journalism to pay for itself,” the founding editor Michael Kinsley wrote at the time.
It has become known for its podcasts, which include the narrative-driven shows “Slow Burn” and “One Year,” as well as the more freewheeling programs “Culture Gabfest” and “Hang Up and Listen.” It also has a daily podcast, “What Next,” hosted by Mary Harris.
Last year, Slate suspended Mike Pesca, the host of its news and culture podcast “The Gist,” after he wrote in a company Slack channel in defense of using a racial slur in certain contexts. Mr. Pesca left Slate in September."

Justice Charles D. Wood has issued an ominous ruling that is clearly breaking with the tradition of a free press that has been established law stemming from the Pentagon Papers case.
In this current case there is not even a hint of a national security breach, yet the judge has allowed Project Veritas to stop The Times from publishing the organization’s memos. We should all be up in arms at what this means to the future of a free press. Only the most sensitive information that could endanger the country should be considered under prior restraint. This case most certainly doesn’t rise to that bar.
Given its name, Project Veritas, it is ironic that the organization is intent on preventing the truth from being printed. But truth may not be its goal.

Re “A Dangerous Court Ruling” (editorial, Dec. 27):
The court’s determination that attorney-client privilege trumped any First Amendment rights of the journalists appropriately recognized a court’s obligation to protect the attorney-client relationship, which is the heart of our judicial system, from improper invasion.
The notion that journalists should be the arbiters of what to publish and when ignores the importance of the attorney-client privilege for purely selfish reasons, improperly cloaked in First Amendment jurisprudence. Justice Charles D. Wood’s decision should be affirmed by the Appellate Division.

Thankfully, Tyler Shultz (grandson of former Secretary of State George Shultz, a Theranos board member) and the journalist John Carreyrou had the common sense and integrity to blow the whistle on the scam. A true cautionary drama of greed, hubris and societal dereliction of duty.

Re “Bonds and Clemens Belong in Cooperstown,” by Jeff Novitzky (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 31):
Is there such a thing as an asterisk in the Hall of Fame?
Was our anger at the failings of Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens in part a misplaced disappointment with the system that enabled the use of performance-enhancing drugs and with ourselves for turning a blind eye? Have we done these two a grave injustice?
Or is the hubris of possibly the two greatest players of their day, maybe of any day, the ultimate basis for denying them entry into the pantheon?
I have struggled to reach my own conclusion, as I long felt that the Hall of Fame exclusion was the only retribution, the only punishment that fit the crime committed by two men who received adulation and riches while bending the rules of the game. But maybe I now can see that the fault was as much with ourselves as with the stars.
So let me now cast aside my doubts and grievances and cast my vote, with an asterisk, for Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens.

Re “With Biometrics, Your Face Is, or Will Be, Your Boarding Pass” (Travel, Dec. 24):
We shouldn’t be so quick to accept the argument that biometrics are “the future.” While the technology may serve the interests of the Transportation Security Administration and the airlines — large bureaucracies that process people on an industrial scale — it’s far less clear that they serve the full interests of individuals.
Biometrics, especially face recognition, allow people to be recognized and tracked en masse not only at the airport but outside it as well. They lead to racially disparate arrests and threaten to chill our freedoms through the total loss of anonymity in public. Cheerful assurances that their application will remain voluntary are not to be believed.
As the dangers of face recognition have become increasingly clear, cities and towns across the United States have enacted bans on government use, and major companies like Amazon and Microsoft have halted sales to law enforcement.
There’s nothing inevitable about this technology. The future is ours to create, and that future shouldn’t include mass biometric tracking.

2022-01-10,"Google wrongly claimed attorney-client privilege to protect documents subpoenaed in a National Labor Relations Board case filed by former employees who say the company fired them because of their unionization efforts, a labor judge has ruled.
The administrative law judge, Paul Bogas, whom the N.L.R.B. appointed as a special master to review the documents, said in a report on Friday that “this broad assertion is, to put it charitably, an overreach.”
The ruling is the latest legal blow to Google’s defense against a complaint, brought by the labor agency in December 2020, that said the company illegally fired and surveilled employees who were involved in labor organizing.
A Google spokeswoman, Jennifer Rodstrom, said in a statement on Monday that the matter had nothing to do with unionization but was about employees breaching security protocols. “We disagree with the characterization of the legally privileged materials referred to by the complainants,” she said.

Judge Bogas ruled in November that Google had improperly characterized 71 of 80 documents sought by the former employees as privileged. The latest report covers around 200 additional documents pertaining to communications around Google’s hiring of IRI Consultants, a firm known for its anti-union work, as part of Project Vivian, an effort to fight labor organizing at the company.
Google must hand over nearly all of those 200 documents, Judge Bogas ruled. He also ordered the company to produce for his review more than 1,000 additional documents that it logged as privileged.
Google’s argument that it had the right to withhold the documents was not “persuasive,” Judge Bogas said, because IRI assisted Google with messaging that did not include legal advice.
In one document that the judge said did not pass muster for confidentiality, a Google lawyer explained that the company wanted consulting help for Project Vivian “to engage employees more positively and convince them that unions suck.” The lawyer provided a long list of areas where IRI could help, including “understanding the current sentiment around labor organizing/unionization efforts at Google.” The lawyer did not mention assistance with legal help.
In another document that Google claimed was privileged, a different Google lawyer offered public relations advice but not legal counsel. The lawyer proposed that the company find a “respected voice” to publish an editorial about what a union would look like in a tech workplace to discourage employees of Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Google from forming one. A human resources director said that she supported the idea, but that it needed to be done without Google’s fingerprints. IRI then sent a proposed editorial to the Google lawyer.

Judge Bogas also chastised Google for marking documents as privileged just because it copied in a company lawyer, even though the communication did not seek legal advice.
“A company cannot cloak a document in privilege merely by providing a copy to counsel,” the judge wrote.
The New York Times reported earlier that Google encouraged employees to aggressively mark internal communication as “A/C Priv,” which is shorthand for “attorney-client privilege,” in the subject line even if they are not seeking legal advice.
Google denied that was the case, and said it informed employees that they should do that only when appropriate."

2022-01-12,"The latest Covid-19 wave has left millions of Americans scrambling for tests, braving long lines in the cold at pop-up sites or searching furiously online for kits to use at home. But for a select group of employees at some of the country’s largest companies, tests are free and often readily available.
Without an adequate federal system for developing and distributing rapid tests, companies have put their own testing services in place.
Google will send full-time employees in the United States free at-home tests that deliver results within minutes and retail for more than $70 each. BlackRock, an investment firm that manages nearly $10 trillion in assets, offers tele-health supervision as employees self-administer rapid tests for international travel. At JPMorgan Chase, bankers, including those at its retail sites, can order at-home rapid tests from an internal company site.
Some companies are using the tests to call their staff back to the office. For others, at-home Covid testing has become the newest wellness benefit, a perk to keep employees healthy and working — even from their couches — while providing peace of mind.

The testing available to a small number of white-collar professionals underscores the difference between their pandemic experience and that of other Americans, putting them at an advantage over many, including workers at small businesses without the means to procure testing kits for their staffs. Like personal protective equipment and vaccines, tests have become the latest example of how a tool to battle the pandemic can exacerbate social and economic divides.
“We’re the epicenter of the epicenter and I can’t get test kits anywhere,” said Thomas Grech, president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, which has roughly 1,400 members that employ about 150,000 workers in the borough.
Some employers secured contracts with companies that supply or administer tests in the earlier months of the pandemic, before the Omicron variant unexpectedly drove up demand. Following the advice of experts, some are incorporating testing as part of their return-to-office protocols.
Belle Haven Investments, an asset management firm in Westchester County in New York with only 40 employees, has been storing tests in a supply closet.

“We’re trying to stockpile them,” said Laura Chapman, chief operating officer of the firm, which has not mandated a return to the office, though many workers have voluntarily come back. She added that the company was ordering only as many tests as employees were demanding, and that they were facing shortages: “Those tests, man, those home tests are so hard to get.”

In the United States, the federal government has moved more slowly than other countries to authorize rapid antigen tests for everyday use. Britain, for example, was quicker to approve rapid tests as a public health tool, leading to faster production. And unlike Washington’s approach to vaccines, the development of rapid tests has until recently been mostly financed by private companies like Abbott Laboratories. The result is a nationwide shortage of tests.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
Americans who cannot get tests are often left to wait in lines that can run as long as three hours. Or they can try to buy at-home tests online or in stores. Walgreens and CVS last month announced limits on the purchase of at-home rapid test kits at stores.
The Biden administration has stepped up its efforts to make tests more broadly available and affordable, requiring insurer reimbursement for tests, invoking the Defense Production Act and announcing plans to ship 500 million tests to Americans. The United States is expected to have one billion rapid tests by the end of this year, or three tests per person, according to Tinglong Dai, a professor at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The country is now reporting more than two million tests a day on average, up from about 500,000 last summer and higher than at any previous point in the pandemic.
Joseph Allen, an associate professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said earlier coordination on the national level could have “flooded the market” with tests and made them more available for everyone.

“It doesn’t surprise me that many organizations who were recognizing they need these tests to stay in business were buying them,” Dr. Allen said.

At Morgan Stanley, bankers can receive up to four free BinaxNOW tests, which cost about $40 in stores, every two weeks through a third party, though the shortage of tests has delayed shipment arrival. At JPMorgan, where corporate employees said they were told last month that they could temporarily work from home because of the fast-spreading Omicron variant, bankers can order rapid tests.
TIAA, an investment firm with 12,000 workers in the United States, began offering free at-home testing to its staff in December 2020. The majority of its employees have worked from home since the start of the pandemic, though roughly 5 percent had been coming into the office last year. There is no limit on the number of tests employees can order, for themselves as well as their family, according to a spokeswoman, Jessica Scott.
“The goal of offering that is providing comfort to our employees so they don’t have to unnecessarily worry or be burdened by having to find a test outside the home,” said Sean Woodroffe, the firm’s head of human resources.
TIAA is considering expanding its testing options, by exploring a partnership with the company Detect, which makes at-home molecular tests. “We’re not hoarding tests,” Mr. Woodroffe added. “We have tests to fulfill our demand.”
Google’s full-time employees in the United States have access to multiple types of coronavirus tests they can take at home, the company said. Since last year, employees have been able to request P.C.R. tests provided by a company called BioIQ. Employees collect a nasal swab at home, and it is processed in the company’s lab.

Google also distributes to employees who want one a small testing device that produces results in minutes.
To perform the rapid molecular test, employees insert a cartridge into the reader, swab their nose and place the swab in the cartridge for results sent by phone. The test is made by Cue Health, a company that provided testing for the National Basketball Association’s bubble.

Google will pay for up to 20 cartridges for the Cue Health testing kit every month for its employees.

Google signed a deal with Cue Health in April to provide its employees with the test kits, according to a securities filing. The devices did not become available to the public for direct purchase until November. Cue Health also had a prior contract with the federal government and assisted it in distributing the tests across 20 states.
Consumers can now buy one of the readers directly from Cue Health for $250, and a 10-pack of the test cartridges retails for $712. Google gives employees 10 tests with the Cue Health reader, and will cover the cost of up to 20 more test cartridges per employee each month. (Cue Health said it offered memberships for consumers, which include discounts on tests and the reader.)

Google uses many temporary workers, vendors and contractors who do not get access to the Cue Health tests, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. A spokeswoman for Google said temporary workers and vendors may use the at-home P.C.R. tests performed by BioIQ if they were coming into Google’s American offices.
Other technology companies have taken more limited approaches to testing. Microsoft offers free rapid antigen home tests to employees on its campus, said a spokesman, Frank Shaw. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, provides testing at around 10 of its offices for employees who have returned for in-person work, said Tracy Clayton, a press officer for the company.
But for many businesses, and their workers, tests are far harder to come by.
Jesus Caicedo-Diaz, who owns Skal, a restaurant in Brooklyn, said his employees were struggling to get Covid test results before the business opened at 10 a.m., with testing lines often running hours long by early morning.
Finding at-home tests is an even greater challenge. “They’re nowhere to be found. They’re all gone. If you do find them, they want $30 for them,” Mr. Caicedo-Diaz said. “If you go to a test site they tell you your result won’t come on time. I don’t know how to navigate this. It’s driving me crazy.”"
2022-01-13,"Microsoft has selected a law firm to review its sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, the company’s board announced on Thursday, after shareholders raised alarms about how Microsoft and Bill Gates, one of its founders, had treated employees, especially women.
The board said it had chosen Arent Fox, based in Washington, D.C. Microsoft said the firm had never done employment-related work for it in the past.
Shareholders passed a resolution during the company’s 2021 annual meeting to review the policies Microsoft has in place for its employees to protect them against abuse and unwanted sexual advances.
The resolution passed with support from almost 78 percent of Microsoft’s shareholders. It was the only of five proposals on ethical issues put forth by shareholders to succeed. Others, like a call for a report on race- and gender-based pay gaps at the company and a pledge to prohibit sales of facial recognition to government entities, failed.

“Microsoft is under intense public scrutiny due to numerous claims of sexual harassment and an alleged failure to address them adequately and transparently,” the text of the resolution said. “Reports of Bill Gates’s inappropriate relationships and sexual advances toward Microsoft employees have only exacerbated concerns, putting in question the culture set by top leadership and the board’s role holding those culpable accountable.”
Mr. Gates solicited at least two employees while he was running Microsoft, according to reports in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. In one incident, in 2007, Mr. Gates sat through a presentation by a Microsoft employee, then immediately emailed her to ask for a date. Microsoft leaders later warned Mr. Gates not to do things like that. In 2019, Microsoft’s board received a letter from an engineer claiming to have had a sexual relationship with Mr. Gates in 2000. A spokeswoman for Mr. Gates confirmed that the two had had an affair that “ended amicably.”
Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday that workplace culture was Microsoft’s “No. 1 priority.”
“We’re committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees,” he said.

Macy's, which began requesting the vaccination status of employees, said it's “evaluating” the Supreme Court's decision.

A mixed mandate
The Supreme Court yesterday blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers, parts of which were set to go into effect on Monday. In the ruling, the court said that the Labor Department does not have the federal authority to issue the mandate. The justices allowed a narrower mandate for health care workers at facilities receiving federal funds to go ahead.
Now what? Here’s what it means for companies:
The government could try again with a new rule. Devising a more tailored emergency rule for a specific set of higher-risk companies, addressing the court majority’s criticism of the employer mandate as a “blunt instrument,” could be quick. Or the agency could use the traditional rule-making process, but that might take years.
This doesn’t stop employers from enforcing their own mandates, but it makes the moves more fraught. It also subjects larger employers to a patchwork of city and state vaccine rules, which would have been pre-empted by a single federal rule. New York City, for example, requires all on-site workers to be vaccinated, while Florida passed a law banning such requirements. And the administration’s separate mandate for federal contractors is currently on hold and likely headed to the Supreme Court, too. Some companies, like Boeing, have delayed mandates until its fate is certain, while others, like Citigroup, have said they are going ahead regardless.
Companies that were on the fence now probably won’t introduce mandates. A spokesman for Macy’s, which began to request the vaccination status of its employees this month, said the retailer was “evaluating this late-breaking development.” In a November poll of companies by Willis Towers Watson, about a third of respondents said they planned to mandate vaccines only if the government’s now-discarded rule took effect.
Health experts said the ruling would exacerbate existing divides, like the one between white-collar employees who can remain at home and blue-collar workers who have to conduct business in person. “This decision will be an excuse for those employers who care less about their employees to return to business as usual,” said David Michaels, an epidemiologist and a professor at George Washington University who is a former OSHA administrator.
Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and the associate dean at Brown University’s School of Public Health, said that with about 30 percent of adults in the U.S. unvaccinated, “I worry that those folks are going to continue to not get vaccinated, unless an awful lot of employers decide that this is in their best interest to put in place.”

Tech companies are subpoenaed in the House’s Jan. 6 investigation. Lawmakers demanded documents from Alphabet, Meta, Reddit and Twitter as part of their inquiry into the Capitol riot.

Microsoft opens a review of its sexual harassment policies. The tech giant said it had hired a law firm to scrutinize its policies, after shareholders voted to support an examination. The move follows reports about how executives — including Microsoft’s founder, Bill Gates — had treated women.
Navient will cancel $1.7 billion in student debt to settle predatory lending claims. The move is part of a settlement with 39 states that had accused the company of lending to people it knew would default. Navient, which didn’t admit fault, will also pay $95 million in restitution.

Biden revamps the Fed’s board
President Biden plans to nominate Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former top Treasury official, and two academic economists, Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson, to fill three open positions on the board of the Federal Reserve. Raskin, who served at the Fed under President Barack Obama, is being nominated for vice chair for supervision, a key regulatory role created after the 2008 financial crisis.

Stricter rules for big banks could be on the way. If confirmed, Raskin would decide on the need for new financial regulations and run the annual stress tests for large financial institutions. She has a track record of arguing for more forceful oversight of the biggest banks. She would take over when the Fed is trying to evaluate the risks of climate change, cryptocurrency and other issues to the nation’s financial system.
The picks would result in the most diverse Fed board in history. Cook, an economist at Michigan State University, would be the first Black woman to be a Fed governor. She is known for her efforts to improve diversity in economics, and her published work covers a wide range of topics (her doctoral thesis focused on credit markets in tsarist and post-Soviet Russia). Jefferson, who is also Black, is an economist at Davidson College whose research has examined poverty and how Fed policy affects low-wage workers. The Fed’s board has had only three Black members in its history, and none served at the same time.

Thrive goes to school for its new chairman
Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm led by Joshua Kushner, has hired Nitin Nohria, the former dean of Harvard Business School, as its first-ever executive chairman. It’s a notable hire for the 12-year-old firm as it looks to build on successful investments in the likes of Affirm, Robinhood and Slack.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Nohria first met Kushner at Harvard in 2010, when the dean advised the budding entrepreneur not to drop out, despite plans to found Thrive and the health insurer Oscar. Nohria would then regularly meet with Kushner as an informal adviser; when he announced plans to step down, Kushner pitched him on joining Thrive. After attending the firm’s investment meetings, Nohria was in: Thrive was “a place where I had a feeling I could contribute to, but also learn a lot from,” he told DealBook.
Nohria has a wide range of responsibilities. He is also joining Thrive as a partner, charged with finding new investments. (His immediate interests include life sciences, given his experience on the boards of Massachusetts General Hospital and Rakuten Medical.) As executive chairman, he’ll help guide the firm more generally, including advising portfolio companies. That said, Nohria doesn’t believe his arrival will lead to big changes in the way Thrive is run.
What’s next for the firm? Nohria said he is thinking about further developments in areas like A.I. and Web3, as well as life sciences, all areas in which Thrive is looking to expand. But he is also worried about the frothy valuations of start-ups, which could roil the venture capital industry if they collapse. (Unsurprisingly, he said Thrive should be fine.)

Weekend reading: Making it work
The pandemic has changed the power dynamics of the workplace. Leaders can’t offer certainty, tolerance for jerks is waning and resignations are on the rise. That makes management harder and more important than ever, argues Jacqueline Carter of the Potential Project, a leadership development firm that aims to “make work feel more human,” with clients like Accenture, Bloomberg and Cisco.
In a new book, “Compassionate Leadership: How to Do Hard Things in a Human Way,” Carter and her colleague Rasmus Hougaard surveyed thousands of executives, managers and employees to find out what qualities leaders need today. DealBook spoke to Carter about their findings. The interview has been edited and condensed.

What constitutes effective leadership now?
Previously, people were told or thought they could not be compassionate. But the scientific data shows we’re wired to connect and that this is an important element of leading effectively. Our research and that of others shows objectively that compassion combined with wisdom helps leaders get better results. It’s not only nice to be nice and wise. It works for productivity.
How do you define compassion?
People can make the mistake of thinking it’s simply saying, “I feel your pain.” That’s empathy, which leaders do need but can be a trap, because it suggests you know something about another’s experience that you may not, particularly in a diverse workplace. Also, we tend to empathize with people who are like us, so it can have limits.
Compassion, on the other hand, triggers a different neurological response. It feels good and shifts perspective. Compassion is asking, “How can I be of benefit?” Compassion is about action, which may include inaction. Sometimes you don’t have an answer but can offer transparency. It’s an intention to be of service.

How is compassion cultivated?
Mantras can help anchor behavior, like the question “How can I be of service?” or the reminder “Clarity is kindness.” Recognize you’re on a journey that doesn’t end. Pause. Be thoughtful. Articulate intentions, then see how things land. Question your assumptions and ask others lots of questions.

Djokovic loses his Australia case
The unvaccinated Serbian tennis superstar left Australia on Sunday night after a court ruled against his bid to stay, costing him a chance at a 10th Australian Open title and a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam title.
In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that Australia’s immigration minister was within his rights to cancel Novak Djokovic’s visa for a second time on the basis that the player could pose a risk to public health and order. (Here’s an explainer on the case.)
Djokovic could be barred from entering Australia for the next three years under its laws regarding visa cancellations. He could face further international travel challenges if he does not get vaccinated.

Russia, the West and Ukraine
Last week’s diplomatic marathon did not defuse the security crisis that Moscow has ignited in Eastern Europe. Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides by 100,000 Russian troops.
And on the sidelines of the talks, Russia issued more subtle but wide-ranging threats.
Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, wants to extend Russia’s sphere of influence to Eastern Europe and secure written commitments that NATO will never again enlarge. Russian officials have hinted that Moscow could take measures like placing nuclear missiles close to the U.S. coastline, if the West fails to meet its security demands.
U.S. officials are threatening to throw their weight behind a Ukrainian insurgency should Russia invade. On Friday, the White House accused Moscow of sending saboteurs to stage an incident in Ukraine to create a pretext for invasion.

Cambodia’s digital crackdown
A new law will allow the authorities to monitor the web by forcing all internet traffic — including from abroad — to route through a government portal.
Even though free speech is enshrined in the Constitution, government surveillance is high in Cambodia. Each ministry monitors the web and reports offending content to an internet crime unit in the Ministry of Interior.
Rights groups say that the new law will make surveillance even easier, and that the crackdown on digital expression is about to get worse. Recently, dozens have been sent to jail for posting jokes, poems, pictures, private messages and songs.

A childhood in war

When you’re a child, how do you get through a war?
A lot of Monopoly, Scrabble, card games, candles and windowless bathrooms turned into family bomb shelters.
Some of those same crutches used to make it through a childhood scarred by conflict — like endless board games — are now a source of trauma for me and my friends. We grew up during Lebanon’s civil war and are now adults trying to live normal lives, raising our own families as the country crashes and burns yet again.
For my generation, emotional minefields can surround the most mundane activities even 32 years since the war ended.

2022-01-17,"KYIV, Ukraine — The week before intensive diplomatic meetings began over the buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border, American and Ukrainian officials watched from afar as Russia began emptying out its embassy in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.
On Jan. 5, 18 people — mostly the children and wives of Russian diplomats — boarded buses and embarked on a 15-hour drive home to Moscow, according to a senior Ukrainian security official.
About 30 more followed in the next few days, from Kyiv and a consulate in Lviv, in western Ukraine. Diplomats at two other Russian consulates have been told to prepare to leave Ukraine, the security official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.
How to interpret the evacuation has become part of the mystery of divining the next play by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Thinning out the Russian Embassy may be part propaganda, part preparation for a looming conflict or part feint, Ukrainian and U.S. officials say. It could be all three.
ADVERTISEMENT

Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that its embassy in Kyiv was functioning normally despite what it said were threats against Russian diplomats and their families.
“Yet again, despite the provocations and the aggressive behavior of local radicals, I repeat that our missions are operating as usual,” said the ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria V. Zakharova.
In recent days, the slow departures — which the Russians most likely knew that the Americans and the Ukrainians would see — have become part of the puzzle of what happens next. They are a more ominous data point, in addition to cyberattacks on Ukrainian ministries last week, and reports from Microsoft and the U.S. government that far more destructive malware has been planted in Ukrainian networks but not activated.
Enormous train convoys loaded with tanks, missiles and troops continue to push west through Russia, apparently heading for the Ukrainian border. Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader of Belarus, announced on Monday that Russian forces and equipment had begun arriving in his country for a joint military exercise that would be held in two places: on Belarus’s western edge, near Poland and Lithuania, two NATO countries; and along the Ukrainian border, which could prove another pathway for invasion.
The exercise has been given a very American-sounding name: Allied Resolve. But in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials fully expect any Russian troops deployed to Belarus for the exercises to remain in place indefinitely, leaving Ukraine open to attack from the north, the east and the south.

“We’ll be fully surrounded by equal forces,” the senior Ukrainian security official said.
In Washington, U.S. officials say they still assess that Mr. Putin has not yet made a decision to invade. They describe him as more a tactician than a grand strategist, and they believe that he is constantly weighing a host of different factors. Among them is how well he could weather the threatened sanctions on his banks and industry, and whether his demands that Ukraine stop veering toward NATO — and that NATO stop spreading toward Russia — are receiving enough attention.
But the U.S. officials say Mr. Putin may also have concluded that with the United States and other countries arming Ukraine, his military advantage is at risk of slipping away. Britain’s defense secretary, Ben Wallace, announced in an address to Parliament on Monday that the country would begin providing Ukraine with light, anti-armor defensive weapons. Mr. Putin may become tempted to act sooner rather than later.
U.S. officials saw Russia’s embassy evacuations coming. “We have information that indicates the Russian government was preparing to evacuate their family members from the Russian Embassy in Ukraine in late December and early January,” a U.S. official said in a statement.
Ukrainian officials say they saw the Russians leave.
But that leaves open the question of what, if anything, the Russians were signaling.

It is possible they were trying to bolster the case that the United States and its Western allies should take seriously their demands that Ukraine can never join NATO, and that troops, nuclear weapons and other heavy weaponry must be removed from former Warsaw Pact states, like Poland, that were once allied with the Soviet Union.

It could also be that the Russians were trying to indicate that an attack was brewing, though there were no other signals. In fact, the buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border is not increasing at a rate that Pentagon officials expected a month ago.
The latest U.S. estimates are that about 60 battalion tactical groups, known as B.T.G.s and each with an average of 800 soldiers, are now in place at the border with Ukraine. Combined with other local forces, the Russians have about 77,000 troops at the border, with more on the way. Others put the figure at closer to 100,000 — much depends on how different forces are counted — but that is well short of the Pentagon’s estimate more than a month ago that the total number could rise to 175,000.
U.S. and European intelligence and military officials say Mr. Putin may be waiting for the ground to freeze, making it easier to get heavy equipment over the border. Or he may be building up slowly, for diplomatic advantage, as he awaits a written reply from the Biden administration and NATO to his demands that they roll back NATO’s military posture to what it was 15 years ago — much farther from Russia’s borders.
While U.S. officials still believe Mr. Putin is undecided about his next move, officials in Kyiv are assessing what an attack may look like, if it happens. It could come in the form of a full-on invasion, the Ukrainian security official said. Or Russia could launch a cyberattack on the Ukrainian energy grid — far larger than the ones conducted in 2015 and 2016 — combined with military escalation in Ukraine’s east, where Russian-backed separatist forces remain deeply entrenched.
No one but the leaders in the Kremlin seem to know for sure how the next days and weeks might play out.

Against this backdrop, a senior delegation of U.S. senators arrived in Kyiv on Monday. Their trip followed a visit to Kyiv last Wednesday by the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, who consulted with intelligence officials and met with Mr. Zelensky to discuss efforts to de-escalate tensions with Moscow, a U.S. official said. Mr. Burns’s trip was reported earlier by CNN.
The senators’ visit was a bipartisan show of support from Ukraine’s most powerful ally, even if they brought few specific proposals for staving off a Russian attack.
“Russia’s actions in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, and the actions that they are planning today, represent the most serious assault on the post-World War II order in our lifetime,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, said at a news conference in Kyiv.
Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and instigated a violent separatist uprising that effectively cleaved away two Ukrainian provinces. More than 13,000 people were killed in the fighting.
At the news conference, Mr. Murphy said he hoped legislation that outlines punishing sanctions against Russia’s leadership, including Mr. Putin, would reach President Biden’s desk before any Russian action and possibly help deter it. In a meeting with the senators late Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine urged them to impose sanctions quickly “to counter the aggression” from Russia.

The senators’ pledges to defend democracy and vanquish tyranny seemed a throwback to the Cold War. Indeed, observers have argued that Mr. Putin’s threats against Ukraine are rooted in a desire to reconstitute a Moscow-led Eastern bloc reminiscent of Soviet times.
Similarly, Mr. Lukashenko, the Belarusian leader who is close to Mr. Putin, made his own argument that the Russians were responding to the Americans.
“What are the Americans doing here?” Mr. Lukashenko said. “There are these hotheads who are calling for war.”
It is possibly in that spirit that Russian troops will begin military exercises in Belarus next month. Security officials fear that the exercises could become a pretext for long-term deployment of Russian forces in the former Soviet republic, which shares a lengthy western border with the European Union and NATO.
Mr. Lukashenko has pledged to follow Mr. Putin’s lead on any action in Ukraine.

2022-01-18,"SEATTLE — Microsoft plans to buy the powerhouse but troubled video game company Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion, its biggest deal ever and one that places a major bet that people will be spending more and more time in the digital world.
The blockbuster acquisition, announced on Tuesday, would catapult the company into a leading spot in the $175 billion gaming industry. Games on virtually every kind of device, from bulky consoles to smartphones, have gained even greater popularity during the pandemic. Technology companies are swarming around the industry, looking for a bigger share of attention and money from the world’s three billion gamers.
In an industry driven by big franchises, Activision makes some of the most popular titles, including Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Yet the company has been roiled in recent months by an employee revolt over accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination.
Microsoft framed the deal as strengthening the company’s hand in the so-called metaverse, the nascent world of virtual and augmented reality. The metaverse has attracted huge amounts of investment and talent, though so far is more of a buzzword than a thriving business. Facebook renamed its parent company to Meta late last year to underscore its commitment.

But the focus on the futuristic metaverse belies the significance of the deal in the present: The acquisition helps Microsoft gain on its rival Sony in the long-running battle for gamers’ attentions and wallets by offering top titles. It also helps the software giant stay ahead of powerful newer competitors in gaming, like Amazon and Google.
Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft’s gaming business, said that whatever the metaverse may end up being, “gaming will be at the forefront of making that mainstream.” For now, he said, the acquisition is about gaining a stronghold in mobile gaming, where Microsoft barely competes, and a studio that produces hugely popular games. He called Call of Duty “one of the amazing entertainment franchises on the planet.”
Federal regulators may raise concerns about the acquisition, as Democrats and Republicans alike have pushed to limit the power of technology giants. On Tuesday, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission announced a new effort to broaden how they should determine if deals are anticompetitive.
Microsoft is valued at more than $2.3 trillion, second only to Apple. The takeover of Activision would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony, the company said. Microsoft now makes Xbox consoles and owns studios that produce hits like Minecraft.
The game industry has been consolidating rapidly. A force behind that — and one that could grab the attention of regulators — is the arms race for exclusive content. Microsoft sometimes makes the games it owns available only on its own devices, such as its Xbox console, and unavailable on those made by competitors, like Sony’s PlayStation.

When asked whether Activision games like Call of Duty would become exclusive to Xbox, Mr. Spencer would say only that “our goal is to allow the content to reach as many players as possible.”
Microsoft has been hunting for ways to spend its immense cash reserve — more than $130 billion — to expand its consumer business. It has looked at acquiring the booming social network TikTok and the popular chat app Discord.
In Activision, which faces accusations that senior executives ignored sexual harassment and discrimination, Microsoft found a target under stress. The allegations have weighed on Activision, with its shares falling 27 percent since California sued the company in July over the claims.

The transaction may be seen as a victory for Bobby Kotick, Activision’s longtime chief executive, whom some critics had sought to force out over the controversy. Mr. Kotick negotiated a big premium for investors — Microsoft is paying $95 a share, roughly 45 percent above his company’s stock price before the announcement, though only slightly more than the trading price before the scandal broke.

Mr. Kotick will stay in his role until the deal is complete. Then the expectation is that he will step down as chief executive, though he could move into an advisory role, according to two people with knowledge of his plans, who would speak only anonymously because the talks were private.
The controversy at Activision began last summer when a California employment agency sued the company over accusations of fostering a toxic workplace culture in which women were routinely sexually harassed and discriminated against. In the ensuing months, employees staged protests, launched social media campaigns and called for executives to resign.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Some top leaders at Activision did leave, including J. Allen Brack, the head of the Blizzard Entertainment subsidiary, and the company pledged $250 million toward increasing employee diversity and said it would strengthen anti-harassment policies. But when The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Mr. Kotick had known for years about accusations of harassment against employees and in some cases had not taken action, calls for his resignation only grew.
Doing a deal with Activision is something of an about-face for Microsoft, which as recently as November was questioning the company’s culture. In an email to Xbox employees that was earlier reported on by Bloomberg and confirmed by the company, Mr. Spencer wrote in November that he was “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at Activision. On Tuesday, he appeared alongside Mr. Kotick to praise the deal, and Mr. Kotick said that he felt the two companies had “similar values and think about our cultures similarly.”

Mr. Spencer said Microsoft “sat down with Bobby and the team and looked at the plan that they have in place,” adding that company culture was always a work in progress. “We are very supportive of the progress that he and the team are making.”
Current and former Activision employees who have been leading the efforts to get the company to reform its culture did not think the purchase was likely to prompt change in the short term, especially because the sale may face a long review from regulators.
The deal could take 12 to 18 months to close, Mr. Spencer said.
“We will continue to fight for improvement and stress proper employee representation,” said Jessica Gonzalez, a former Activision employee and one of the organizers of the ABetterABK activist movement. She added that “this doesn’t change anything.”
Game companies, flush with cash since the pandemic increased the industry’s profits, have been consolidating rapidly. The previous record for the biggest merger in the game industry was set just last week, when Take-Two Interactive, the creator of games like Grand Theft Auto, announced plans to buy the mobile game publisher Zynga for more than $11 billion.

Last year, Electronic Arts and Take-Two engaged in a bidding war over Codemasters, a racing game company that eventually went to EA for $1.2 billion. Microsoft made another splashy purchase in 2020 when it bought ZeniMax Media and its slate of gaming studios for $7.5 billion.
Activision itself was the product of serial deal-making by Mr. Kotick over decades, rolling up smaller game studios. It took shape in its current form when Activision — then known primarily for producing titles for traditional gaming consoles — agreed to combine with the gaming unit of France’s Vivendi to expand into multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft.
Activision later bought King, the European gaming company behind Candy Crush, to expand into mobile games. King produced $1 billion in operating profit during the latest 12-month period.
“Scale truly is a tremendous benefit in the world of gaming,” said Hope Cochran, King’s former chief financial officer, who is now a managing director at Madrona Venture Group. “You want to build a community, and you need enough people to build it.”
Activision’s gaming efforts are facing headwinds. Players panned the most recent Call of Duty release, and releases of titles like Diablo and Overwatch have been delayed. Still, Activision remains quite profitable, reporting $639 million in profit in its most recent quarter.

Mr. Kotick characterized the deal as a calculation that Activision did not have the tools to keep up with big tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Tencent in the rapidly evolving gaming landscape.
“We realized it was going to be an increasingly competitive world with resources that we just didn’t have,” he said.

Russia and U.S. to meet in effort to break deadlock
Seeking to head off a potential assault on Ukraine, Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, will meet with Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, in Geneva on Friday as the two sides explore whether there is still a diplomatic path to avoiding a conflict in Eastern Europe.
Negotiating sessions last week ended in an impasse, with talks deadlocked over Russia’s demand that NATO pledge not to expand eastward. Russian officials said they expected a written “article-by-article” response from the U.S. to their proposals, which would effectively restore Russia’s sphere of influence to close to Soviet-era lines. It is unclear whether Blinken will provide such a response.
A State Department official warned that Russia — which has assembled as many as 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s border — could launch an attack at any time. But in a call with Blinken, Lavrov rejected the idea that Russia was planning to do so and insisted that it was up to Ukraine to calm tensions, according to Russian officials.
Deterrence: The U.S. and its allies have promised to impose punishing sanctions if Russia attacks Ukraine. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, warned Russia of “high costs” in the event of military action, which some have speculated could involve the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

As pressure mounts, Johnson teases an end to some restrictions
Boris Johnson, Britain’s besieged prime minister, indicated yesterday that a plan to ease coronavirus restrictions in England might be in the works, a move that could mollify critics in his restive Conservative Party at a time when political scandals threaten his future in Parliament. His Cabinet will meet today to review the current curbs and to discuss the latest health data.
Under the current rules, introduced in December, people have been urged to work from home if possible and instructed to wear masks in public transportation. “Decisions on the next steps remain finely balanced,” Downing Street said in a statement that urged the public to get booster shots.
Whether Johnson can remain in power may depend on whether a fellow Conservative is willing to start a plot against him. There are many candidates, but the tactics and timing of a leadership challenge are fiendishly tricky. An uneasy lull has settled over Westminster as Johnson’s allies and rivals wait for the results of an internal investigation of the parties held at Downing Street during lockdown that prompted the recriminations.

A $69 billion bet on the metaverse
In its largest ever acquisition, Microsoft agreed to buy the video game maker Activision Blizzard, creator of such games as Call of Duty and Candy Crush, for $68.7 billion in cash. (It also inherits Activision’s troubled workplace.) The deal will position Microsoft for the next generation of the internet, and it is not expected to close until the next fiscal year, which ends in June 2023.
The acquisition would catapult Microsoft into a leading spot in the video game industry and could strengthen its hand in virtual and augmented reality. Microsoft framed the deal as strengthening the company’s hand in the so-called metaverse, the nascent world of virtual and augmented reality. Our tech columnist explains what you need to know.
Regulators in the U.S. face a challenge in deciding how to approach the huge deal. Democrats and Republicans alike have pushed to limit the power of technology giants. The takeover would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony, the company said.

Anne Frank’s betrayal
A new book, “The Betrayal of Anne Frank,” made headlines this week after naming a Jewish notary, Arnold van den Bergh, as a suspect in the unsolved mystery of who alerted the authorities to the hiding place of the teenage diarist Frank, her family and four other Jewish people, resulting in their deportation to concentration camps.
But many experts said they doubted the theory expounded in the book. “They came up with new information that needs to be investigated further, but there’s absolutely no basis for a conclusion,” said Ronald Leopold, the Anne Frank House’s executive director.
The suspect wasn’t new to historians. Anne’s father, Otto, received an anonymous note that identified van den Bergh as the perpetrator. The book, based on a six-year investigation, claims that van den Bergh had a list of Jews in hiding that he had gotten from the Amsterdam Jewish Council — but researchers say there is no evidence that the council had any such list.
Dara Horn, the author of “People Love Dead Jews,” an exploration of antisemitic attitudes, said the story fit into a trope of Jews turning against Jews. “There’s even a name for this in Jewish studies, called ‘Holocaust inversion,’” she said. “There’s a reason why that’s appealing to a non-Jewish audience. It makes it so you don’t have to think about your own responsibility.”

2022-01-20,"Russia has stationed about 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s government has issued a list of demands that Western powers are highly unlikely to meet. And President Biden said yesterday that he expected Putin to send troops over the border. “But I think he will pay a serious and dear price for it,” Biden added.
Today’s newsletter offers a Q. and A. on the risks of war in Eastern Europe.
“The overall threatening rhetoric from the Kremlin and the movement that military analysts are seeing on the ground give us a lot of ground for concern,” Anton Troianovski, The Times’s Moscow bureau chief, told my colleague Claire Moses. “It’s a very serious situation.”
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia’s foreign minister are scheduled to meet for talks tomorrow in Geneva.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Five questions
1. Why is Putin threatening war with Ukraine?
The honest answer is that most diplomats and experts aren’t entirely sure. “It’s not clear what Russia’s central demand is,” Blinken told reporters yesterday in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.
Even Putin’s top advisers may not know what he is trying to accomplish and how seriously he is considering an invasion, as Anton has written. “The expert opinion that I can authoritatively declare is: Who the heck knows?” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a Russian foreign-policy analyst who advises the Kremlin.
This murkiness allows Putin to declare the confrontation a success in multiple scenarios.
2. Why is the U.S. so alarmed?
A successful invasion would establish Russia as a dominant, expansionist power in Eastern Europe. It would make other democracies (like Taiwan) worry that they could be vulnerable to takeover by nearby authoritarian countries (like China).
3. What does Putin say his rationale is?
Perhaps the best-known statement of Putin’s 20-plus years as Russia’s dominant political figure came from an annual state-of-the-nation speech in 2005 at the Kremlin. The collapse of the Soviet Union, he said, was the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century.
Ukraine was arguably the most painful loss for Moscow. It was the most populous former Soviet republic to form its own country apart from Russia. The two now share a 1,200-mile border, and Putin often cites their deep cultural ties.
But Ukraine has drifted toward the West in recent years. The U.S. and its allies have increased military aid to Ukraine and also said — albeit vaguely — that Ukraine will one day join NATO.
Putin has defended the troop buildup by saying it is merely a military exercise. Russia has also released its list of demands, including a NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine and a pullback of NATO troops in Eastern Europe (effectively to where they were in the late 1990s).
Biden, responding to a question from The Times’s David Sanger at a news conference yesterday, said Ukraine was unlikely to join NATO “in the near term.” But Biden ruled out the idea of removing NATO troops from Eastern Europe.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
4. What isn’t Putin saying?
Some observers believe that the troop buildup is a mixture of bluff and distraction.
A group of Russia experts — including Frederick Kagan, who has advised U.S. military leaders in the past — made this argument in a recent report called “Strategic Misdirection.” A full-scale invasion of Ukraine could be bloody and expensive, they wrote, potentially damaging Russia’s economy and Putin’s political standing.
As Kori Schake explained in The Atlantic: “Half a million Ukrainians have military experience; 24 percent of respondents in one recent poll said that they would resist Russian occupation ‘with a weapon in hand.’ Russia might succeed in taking Ukraine, but it is unlikely to hold it.”

Another reason to be skeptical of invasion: So far, Putin does not appear to be preparing Russians to go to war. Russia’s deputy foreign minister continued this pattern yesterday, saying, “We will not attack, strike, invade, quote unquote, whatever, Ukraine.”
Putin may instead be trying to redefine what the West considers unacceptable behavior, Kagan and his co-authors argued. By making an invasion seem possible, Putin can try to win other concessions, such as a freer hand in Eastern Europe.
“In the worst-case version of this scenario, the West will be congratulating itself for having avoided a Russian invasion Putin never meant to launch while Putin quietly celebrates an important nonmilitary victory that the West does not even recognize,” Kagan and his colleagues wrote.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
(Thomas Friedman, the Times Opinion columnist, argues that the threat of war also helps distract Russians from their economic problems.)
5. So the risk of war is low?
Not necessarily. Even skeptics like Kagan acknowledge it is possible, given the lack of transparency about Putin’s thinking.
A few analysts, like Melinda Haring of the Atlantic Council, believe war is the most likely outcome: Putin has lost patience with Ukraine, she has written, and believes the U.S. would not go to war over it. (Biden said yesterday that a “minor incursion” would not necessarily pull the U.S. into the fight.) Putin also craves a historical legacy that a territorial expansion could ensure, by helping reverse the catastrophe of the Soviet collapse.
“It’s very hard to gauge the probability,” Michael Crowley, a Times reporter who is covering Blinken’s European trip, told me from Kyiv yesterday. “This is going to require very creative diplomacy to resolve, if it can be resolved.”

A towering force in fashion
André Leon Talley’s approach to fashion could best be described as “more.” More glamour, more decadence, more delight. He evoked drama in both his personal style — wearing capes and furs — and his declarations. “It’s a famine of beauty, honey!” he once proclaimed. “My eyes are starving for beauty!”
Talley, who died this week at 73, was a pioneering figure in fashion. Using his encyclopedic knowledge of fashion history and his quick wit, he became an editor, author, adviser and TV personality. In the 1980s, he worked his way up to creative director at Vogue, and he spent decades there in various roles.
A 1994 New Yorker profile called Talley “The Only One” — a reference to him often being the sole high-powered Black editor in a field that is notoriously white. His influence is hard to overstate: He mentored the supermodel Naomi Campbell and helped dress Michelle Obama as first lady.
Growing up in the Jim Crow South, Talley wallpapered his bedroom with images ripped from Vogue. “I went to school and to church and I did what I was told and I didn’t talk much,” he told Vogue in 2018. “But I knew life was bigger than that. I wanted to meet Diana Vreeland and Andy Warhol and Naomi Sims and Pat Cleveland and Edie Sedgwick and Loulou de la Falaise. And I did. And I never looked back.” — Sanam Yar, a Morning writer

2022-01-21,"LONDON — Standing in front of a golden bandstand, dressed in a white satin gown and pearls, the vocalist Nubiya Brandon sashayed to a gentle beat. Stepping toward the spotlight, she took a lazy turn around the stage, singing a playful calypso number and smiling occasionally at the band behind.
The weird thing about this show, called “All Kinds of Limbo,” was that Brandon appeared to be in this reporter’s kitchen. The singer was in fact an eerily realistic holographic avatar on a mobile phone screen; her performance had been recorded and was now being broadcast in augmented reality from the National Theater in London.
Via the technology’s strange alchemy, which overlays digital imagery onto whatever a camera phone is pointing at, Brandon seemed to be singing and sashaying on the countertop. After she took a bow, her image evaporated and the bandstand faded into nothingness, leaving only a sink full of washing up behind.
The success of digital-only theater productions has been one of the pandemic’s surprise silver linings: Audiences have been willing to try them and theater companies have found fans thousands of miles away. But could immersive technologies provide a more intriguing path forward for drama, one that will endure once Covid-19 (hopefully) subsides? Augmented reality (A.R.) and virtual reality (V.R.) are already changing gaming, music and art; might theater be next?
“All Kinds of Limbo’s” director, Toby Coffey, said he hopes so. In 2016, he set up the National Theater’s Immersive Storytelling Studio, which operates as a kind of “start-up” within the company, he said in a recent interview at the studio’s modest space, which was crowded with a jumble of technical equipment. The team’s brief is to see how live theater and new technologies can interact and intersect.

“Theater makers are naturally fascinated: They’re used to working in 3-D,” Coffey said. “As soon as you bring a director or stage designer or choreographer into V.R., you see their brains whirring.”
The studio’s first production, “Fabulous Wonder.land,” was a V.R. music video featuring a track by the musician Damon Albarn with words by the playwright Moira Buffini. The team has since made 360-degree films of live shows, developed a one-on-one piece in which an audience member interacts with a live actor while wearing a V.R. headset and created a mixed-reality “exhibition” about government welfare cuts.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“All Kinds of Limbo” came into being in 2019 after the National Theater had a hit with “Small Island,” a play about postwar Jamaican immigration to Britain. Coffey and his team commissioned Brandon, the vocalist, and the composer Raffy Bushman to create a 10-minute song sequence responding freely to the play’s themes. It was written, performed and motion-captured that year, and was initially presented as a V.R. experience in one of the theater’s event spaces.

When the pandemic shut down British performing venues in March 2020, Coffey accelerated plans to turn “All Kinds of Limbo” into an at-home experience. The retooled version can be watched via A.R. on a mobile device, via a V.R. headset, or on a regular computer. Brandon’s performance stays the same, but, depending on the device used, the experience feels subtly different.
To summon some of theater’s shared intimacy, it’s being ticketed and broadcast as live, although the show is recorded. Other people attending virtually are represented by blades of moving white light and, by playing with the settings, you can move around the space and see the action from different angles.
It’s a short piece, but “All Kinds of Limbo” does feel like the glimmering of a new art form: somewhere between music video, video game and live cabaret show.
Over the last few years, Britain’s theater scene has become a test bed for similar experiments. Last spring, the Royal Shakespeare Company co-produced an immersive digital piece called “Dream” that featured actors performing using motion-capture technology and was watchable via smartphone or computer. Other projects, such as shows by the Almeida theater in London and the company Dreamthinkspeak in Brighton, England, require participants to turn up in person and get equipped with VR headsets.

Francesca Panetta, a V.R. producer and artist who was recently appointed as the alternate realities curator at the Sheffield DocFest film festival, said in a video interview that practitioners from audio, gaming, theater, TV and other art forms were collaborating as never before. “Many different people are trying to explore this space and work out what it really is,” she said. “No one is quite sure.”
One of the most keenly awaited partnerships is between the immersive theater troupe Punchdrunk, which pioneered live site-specific shows such as “Sleep No More” and “The Masque of the Red Death” in the mid-2000s, and the tech firm Niantic, best-known for the wildly successful A.R. game Pokémon Go.
Speaking by phone, Punchdrunk’s co-founder Felix Barrett seemed invigorated by the creative possibilities. “We’re on the cusp of a new form of entertainment,” he said. “It’s a new genre; it just hasn’t been named yet.”
Later this year, Niantic and Punchdrunk plan to unveil the first results of their collaboration. Barrett was reluctant to reveal too much, but said that it would offer participants “a citywide adventure” that will feel like an immersive video game happening in the real world. “Our goal is to try and make you the hero of your own living movie,” he said.
Ambitious as such projects are, they are also — at least by theater standards — time-consuming and forbiddingly expensive. The Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Dream” wouldn’t have been possible without corporate sponsorship and a hefty grant from a roughly $55-million British government fund promoting digital arts innovation. The latest iteration of “All Kinds of Limbo” relies on a partnership with Microsoft and the livestreaming platform Dice.

There’s also the question of audience. Though theater-led projects such as “Dream” and “All Kinds of Limbo” have gained positive reviews, they have attracted only a tiny fraction of the 12 million viewers who watched a 2020 virtual performance by the rapper Travis Scott in the online game Fortnite. The chances of monetization at scale look slim, at least for now.
And the irony is that, while the pandemic may have whetted audience appetites for digital drama, it has had devastating consequences for theater companies themselves. The National Theater’s Immersive Storytelling Studio originally had four staff members; after belt-tightening layoffs in the company, it’s now just Coffey and one full-time co-worker. “Even before the pandemic, we could have been doing 10 times more than we had resource to be able to do,” Coffey said. “We need to work within those restrictions.”
What happens next is up for debate. The National Theater is working on redeploying the app and distribution platform used for “All Kinds of Limbo” into something that works for other projects. Panetta said that the metaverse, if it genuinely takes off, offers its own possibilities for live performance. “It’s difficult to see what the pathway is; I suspect it’ll be a mix of many different things,” she added.
So how long until we’re watching Ibsen or Shakespeare in augmented reality at our kitchen tables? Coffey laughed, then cautioned that designing successful A.R. performances was still an emerging skill. “But some day it’ll happen, I have no doubt,” he said.

What’s Up? (Jan. 16-22)
Microsoft Strikes a Deal
Microsoft on Monday announced plans to buy the video game company Activision Blizzard for almost $70 billion, its biggest deal ever. The company said the acquisition would help it compete in the so-called Metaverse, the nascent virtual world where some technologists believe we’ll soon live second lives. But Microsoft’s more immediate objective is probably to strengthen its gaming platform. Just as Netflix acquires content to compete for streaming viewers’ attention and subscription fees, Microsoft’s purchase of Activision — the maker of popular games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush — may bolster the library of games for Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft’s $10-a-month Netflix-style video game subscription service. The size of the deal, and the possibility that Microsoft could make some popular Activision titles exclusive to its platform, could bring renewed antitrust scrutiny to the company from federal regulators.
A Clash of Technologies
Airlines warned early in the week that a major expansion of fifth generation cellular service planned for Wednesday could disrupt flights. Unlike previous generations of wireless service, 5G technology uses radio frequencies similar to the ones used by the devices pilots depend on to determine a jet’s altitude, and for years, experts have said it could interfere with that equipment. Flight cancellations and chaos were ultimately avoided by a last-minute decision by AT&T and Verizon to restrict 5G service near airports. President Biden said that federal officials would continue to work with wireless companies, airlines and aviation manufacturers to find a “permanent, workable solution.”
Intel Invests in U.S. Chip Making
Intel plans to build a $20 billion chip manufacturing complex in Ohio, a move that has implications for geopolitics and the supply chain. During the pandemic, manufacturing disruptions and labor shortages caused a shortage of chips, which are mostly manufactured in Taiwan. Legislation that passed in the Senate last year would provide $52 billion in subsidies for the chip industry to help the United States compete with China on innovation by expanding its stake in a foundational technology. Intel plans to start construction in Ohio later this year and to begin producing chips there by 2025. Patrick Gelsinger, Intel’s chief executive, has said Intel might invest as much as $100 billion over a decade in its next U.S. manufacturing campus, with the speed and scope of the expansion depending partly on the availability of federal grants.

Unilever faces questions about its strategy.

Nelson Peltz’s next target
Unilever has faced pressure on multiple fronts for weeks, including pushback from shareholders over its now-abandoned pursuit of GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer business. Now the consumer goods giant must deal with a potentially bigger headache: Trian Partners, the activist investment firm run by Nelson Peltz.
Trian has amassed a significant stake in Unilever, DealBook’s Michael de la Merced reports. It isn’t clear how big the firm’s holdings are, though Trian began buying shares before Unilever’s pursuit of the Glaxo business became public, according to a source.
Unilever has taken fire over strategic missteps. Investors and analysts scorned the $68 billion Glaxo bid, with Unilever’s shares falling sharply after the company said it still wanted to buy the business, despite being rejected three times. And another big Unilever shareholder accused the company of neglecting business fundamentals while overemphasizing its commitment to climate and social causes.
What does Trian want? It isn’t clear what the activist is pushing for, but Peltz’s firm often demands that huge corporations — including General Electric, Mondelez and Procter & Gamble — simplify and improve their operations, and sometimes calls for them to sell off underperforming divisions. Unilever said last week that it wanted to focus on higher-growth areas like health, hygiene and beauty. Streamlining its operations would be in keeping with recent moves at other conglomerates, including G.E., J&J and Toshiba.
Is a board fight in the future? Trian has won high-profile proxy battles before, including at P.&G. in what was the most expensive war for a board seat on record. Peltz may have support from restive shareholders if he mounts a challenge at Unilever. Shares in Unilever are up 6 percent so far today.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
An activist investor with “grave concerns” pushes Peloton to sell itself. In a letter to the embattled at-home fitness equipment maker, Blackwells Capital called for directors to fire the company’s C.E.O., co-founder John Foley, and to weigh a sale as its shares tumble amid falling sales.  The company is in worse shape now than before the pandemic propelled its growth, Blackwells said, with “high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders.”
Chinese state media puts more pressure on Ant Group. In a documentary, the state-run China Central Television suggested that the Alibaba affiliate made “unreasonably high payments” to the brother of a former government official. (Ant wasn’t mentioned by name.) That turns up the heat on Ant, which scrapped its I.P.O. in 2020 after opposition from regulators.
The Omicron wave may be peaking in the U.S., Dr. Anthony Fauci says. He told ABC yesterday that the latest coronavirus surge was “going in the right direction,” but cautioned against overconfidence. In other pandemic news, public health experts worry that new coronavirus treatments could lead to more resistant strains; The Times takes a sweeping look at President Biden’s efforts to fight the pandemic; and Winter Olympics athletes are going to great lengths to avoid getting sick.
Financial firms want employees back at the office soon. Citigroup told New York-area workers to prepare for a return to office work from Feb. 7, while Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have planned for Feb. 1. In London, where government restrictions are ending on Wednesday, banks are bringing back workers this week.
More workers move to unionize. Employees at an REI store in Manhattan filed for a union election in hopes of organizing 115 workers. Workers at Raven Software, a studio owned by Activision Blizzard that helps create the video game series Call of Duty, are also seeking to unionize. Both follow efforts to organize workers at Starbucks and Amazon in recent months.

Why activists are going after Kohl’s, too
The retailer Kohl’s has received a roughly $9 billion offer to go private in a deal with an investment consortium led by Acacia Research, which is backed by the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch reports. The offer came days after another activist firm, Macellum Advisors, which is threatening a proxy fight with Kohl’s, urged the retailer to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale.
The quick procession of Macellum’s letter and the consortium’s offer could put pressure on Kohl’s to consider a sale — or find another way to boost its share price. Will the pressure work?
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A key question is whether the bidders have the funds to finance a buyout. Starboard has helped Acacia raise equity capital to fund its offer; Acacia has received a letter of confidence from a bank pledging support for arranging debt; and Acacia is in talks with a property firm that would sell off part of Kohl’s real estate to help fund the bid. Kohl’s is up nearly 30 percent in premarket trading, suggesting that investors are taking the bid seriously.
Other buyers may be interested. Sycamore, the private equity firm, has also reached out to Kohl’s about a potential deal, though it’s unclear whether it will lead to an official offer. Sycamore is known for its willingness to take on challenging retail deals, like Staples, but its recent acquisition of the department store chain Belk, which resulted in bankruptcy, may limit its appetite for similar deals. Other large private equity firms remain wary of retail buyouts, but debt is cheap and funds are looking for ways to spend their so-called dry powder.
Part of the pitch is unlocking high e-commerce valuations. Among other things, Macellum is urging Kohl’s to consider splitting its online operations from its brick-and-mortar business, an increasingly popular request by activists. (That’s what Saks has been planning to do.) But many online retailers that went public last year have tumbled, like Lulu’s Fashion (down 48 percent from its I.P.O. price) AKA Brands (down 43 percent) and AllBirds (down 18 percent). Some experts question the logic of separating online from offline, given a push to interweave the two shopping experiences.
Kohl’s has performed better than some of its department store peers, in part because of its smaller stores and off-mall locations, which put it in a better position for today’s shopping habits. It has also signed partnerships with the likes of Amazon and Sephora. But activist investors think it can do better, and the biggest challenge may be its middle-of-the-pack positioning among department stores.

Behind the sports-crypto sponsorship complex
An investor lawsuit, which DealBook’s Ephrat Livni is the first to report, has accused insiders at a crypto company of misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars. The case shines a light on the fast-blooming union between sports and the cryptocurrency industry.
Crypto companies have signed numerous splashy sports deals. Last year the little-known crypto firm DigitalBits, along with a related entity, Zytara, paid around $140 million in sponsorship deals with the Italian soccer clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan, and also secured the services of the soccer star Francesco Totti and the boxer Floyd Mayweather. Now, a major early investor alleges in a suit in New York State Court that company insiders diverted money needed for development to those sports deals, among other things like luxury travel.

Attention from sponsorships has helped raise the profile and price of cryptocurrencies like XDB, the DigitalBits cryptocurrency. DigitalBits describes itself as a “blockchain for brands,” or corporate crypto-based rewards programs, and Zytara says it creates NFTs “to accelerate customer engagement in a unique and trendy way.”
“There is nothing behind the project,” said the plaintiff’s counsel, Adam Ford of Ford O’Brien. He said that reviews of the code reveal little work: The defendants “do not have a publicly accessible blockchain or anything to show other than big-dollar sponsorship deals and constant announcements that the real thing is coming.” DigitalBits and Zytara did not respond to requests for comment.
The hype created by crypto sponsorships is raising concern:
There is growing pressure for crypto promotions in Britain and the E.U. to follow stricter rules on transparency, as crypto sponsorships for sports teams flourish in Europe.
A recent proposed class action lawsuit in California accused Mayweather and fellow celebrity sponsor Kim Kardashian of helping to artificially inflate the price of the cryptocurrency EthereumMax, causing investors losses.
In November, the British soccer club Manchester City backed out of an agreement with an obscure decentralized finance project called 3key, while the Spanish club FC Barcelona canceled a deal with Ownix, an NFT auction platform, amid reports that a company associate was charged with crypto-related fraud.
And then there is the crash in crypto prices, which has erased more than $1 trillion in value since November, with a particularly steep drop in recent days. As a result, blockchain businesses seeking attention may find that they have less to spend on sponsorships — and everything else.

2022-01-25,"Microsoft announced record profit and sales on Tuesday despite investor fears that the pandemic-fueled tech boom may be over.
The first of the largest tech companies to report earnings for the three months ending in December, Microsoft said it had $51.7 billion in sales, up 20 percent from a year earlier, and profit rose 21 percent to $18.8 billion. The company saw particularly strong growth in its cloud services while locking up long-term customer deals.
Although it beat Wall Street expectations, the company’s shares were down almost 5 percent in aftermarket trading but rebounded later in the day. The drop was most likely caused by a jittery stock market and some results that fell short for bullish investors.
In a call with investors, executives shared an optimistic outlook for the next quarter, sending Microsoft’s share price higher. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said the demand for services was still strong.

“Coming out of the pandemic we are seeing actually a lot of constraints in the economy, and the only resources that can help drive productivity while keeping costs down is digital tech,” he said.
Microsoft had $125 billion in cash, almost $70 billion of which it hopes to spend on buying the video game powerhouse Activision in a deal announced this month. Bank of America analysts called the purchase a “savvy maneuver” and a “strategic and financial positive, which can accelerate Microsoft’s gaming business across numerous platforms.”
Sales of Microsoft’s cloud offerings to commercial customers, which includes Office 365 subscriptions and Azure, its cloud computing platform, grew 32 percent to $22.1 billion. Revenue is poised to grow further as price increases for Office 365, which includes Word and the Teams communications app, go into effect in March. The price increases could produce $5 billion in extra revenue this year, according to Wedbush Securities.
Azure is the second-largest cloud platform, after Amazon Web Services. It is part of a fundamental shift in how companies are moving more of their business online. Azure grew 46 percent, reflecting how customers across industries are signing larger, longer deals.
Brett Iversen, the head of Microsoft’s investor relations, said that despite turmoil in the stock market, the company was focused on long-term opportunities so it could cut “through the shorter-term, external noise that we don’t control as much.”

Mr. Iversen said Microsoft’s Windows business was particularly strong, with sales up 25 percent as corporate customers bought new computers for their employees.
Despite chip shortages that limited the supply of the new Xbox console during the holiday season, the company’s gaming business grew 8 percent, part of its personal computing segment, which grew 15 percent to $17.5 billion.
The so-called Great Resignation among workers also helped LinkedIn, the professional social network, which saw revenue increase 37 percent."

2022-01-27,"Apple weathered the supply chain snarls at the end of 2021 that tripped up the global electronics market and other industries, announcing on Thursday an 11 percent increase in revenue and a 20 percent jump in profit in its most recent quarter while offering optimism that the worst of the problems were behind it.
Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations with its record results, easing fears that the tech industry’s long period of fast growth may be coming to an end. It made $34.6 billion in profit off revenue of $123.9 billion in the three months ending in December, though its revenue growth continued to slow.
As usual, the iPhone drove sales for Apple, which briefly crossed $3 trillion in market value earlier in January before sliding back to about $2.6 trillion by Thursday. Sales of iPhones totaled $71.6 billion, up 9 percent from a year earlier. Demand for the newest iPhone 13 juiced sales, but the company has been warning for months that computer chip shortages and pandemic-related manufacturing problems in Asia were likely to limit supply and hamper revenue.
A global chip shortage has hurt a wide range of industries, including consumer electronics and cars. On Monday, Gina M. Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, said the U.S. was facing an “alarming” shortage of semiconductors.

Chip shortages have forced some factories to slow or suspend production. That has dented U.S. economic growth and led to soaring inflation in the United States.
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in October that supply constraints had cost his company $6 billion in revenue during its fall quarter. During a call with investors on Thursday, he said Apple “experienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter” during the holidays, but he declined to give a specific number.
Mr. Cook said he saw light at the end of the tunnel for Apple: He expected supply problems in the current quarter to be less than they were during the holidays.
“We pride ourselves in getting products to customers who really want them, and we try to do that on a fast basis, and so it’s frustrating that we can’t always do that at the speed we would like,” he said during the earnings call. “However, March is better than December, and so there’s some encouraging signs there.”
Mr. Cook said much of the difficulty stemmed from procuring a particular type of computer chip, but he did not think the struggles necessitated Apple re-evaluating how it operated its supply chain.

“I think our supply chain actually does very good considering the shortages, because it’s a fast-moving supply chain,” he said.
Apple saw sales growth around the world, led by a 20 percent year-over-year increase in China and 19 percent in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, though sales in Japan dropped by 14 percent from the same quarter the prior year. iPad sales were particularly constrained by the supply chain problems, Mr. Cook said; the company reported a 14 percent decrease in sales of the tablets from the same time the prior year.
Apple announced a slate of new hardware products in the fall, including new models of its MacBook Pro laptop computer, AirPods, the iPad and the Apple Watch. It is working on an augmented reality headset that could compete with offerings from companies like Meta, Facebook’s parent, as technology companies increasing jockey for influence in the budding metaverse, a futuristic online universe.
Mr. Cook sidestepped a question about how Apple is thinking about the metaverse on the earnings call, saying, “We see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly.”
Apple also benefited from strong growth in its services business, including its App Store, which Mr. Cook described as an “economic miracle for developers around the world” even as it continues to face accusations that it stifles competition and levies onerous fees on app developers. The services business was up nearly 24 percent in the quarter from a year ago, to $19.5 billion.

Apple also said it planned to use nearly $27 billion of its cash to pay dividends to shareholders. Shares of Apple stock jumped more than 4 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday evening.
Apple’s positive results came near the end of a week of wild trading on the stock market that was due in part to fears about how quickly the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in an attempt to curb inflation. Higher interest rates make riskier investment, like technology stocks, less appealing, adding to concerns that the pandemic-fueled boost to technology companies could soon be ending.
But Microsoft and Tesla, despite dealing with supply chain woes of their own, posted record profits this week and beat industry expectations. Next week, Alphabet, Google’s parent, and Amazon will report their results for the last three months of 2021, providing insight into the health of online advertising and retail."

After being walloped in 2020 and 2021, organizers of major late winter and early spring events, from the Super Bowl to the National Cherry Blossom Festival, were hoping 2022 would offer a return to normal. But the rapid-fire spread of the Omicron variant has infected tens of millions of Americans and even more worldwide, and has the organizers of some big events changing plans. Just three weeks before it was scheduled to restart in person in Park City, Utah, the Sundance Film Festival, pivoted to an all-virtual edition, which launched Jan. 20.
The move was a blow to the already bruised hotel industry in Park City, though Dan Bullert, the president of the Park City Area Lodging Association, said that local hotels had been able to recoup some losses by marketing to skiers eager to capitalize on the lack of crowds.
“It’s definitely not a windfall, but the area has seen a rise in skier count with the absence of Sundance,” he said. “Canceling in early January was difficult for the community from a financial perspective, but we both understand and support the decision.”
There will be empty hotel rooms and empty stands in Beijing, as well: NBC Sports announcers will be covering the 2022 Winter Olympics from their studios in Connecticut when the games kick off on Feb. 4, and Olympic organizers announced on Jan. 17 that tickets would not be sold to the general public, but would be given to invited groups of residents of the Chinese mainland.

But other major gatherings planned for the coming months are moving forward, though with some alterations. Here’s how some big events will be staged during the Omicron surge.

Super Bowl LVI
Despite exploring potential alternative sites in Arlington, Texas, and elsewhere as virus levels in California climbed, National Football League officials have confirmed that the biggest U.S. sporting event of the year is set to kickoff Feb. 13 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. Those watching Super Bowl LVI at home can expect to see masks on spectators — both in the stands and at related events. Los Angeles County requires masks indoors for all people age 2 and up regardless of vaccination status, and outdoors at any event with more than 5,000 attendees. SoFi Stadium seats 70,000, and can be expanded to hold 100,000 for events like the Super Bowl, which is being held without any capacity limits.
The N.F.L. Players Association, the league’s labor union, has canceled many of its social events in the lead-up to the big game, including its annual fund-raising jazz brunch, “Smocks and Jocks — where paintings by current and former players are auctioned for charity — citing Omicron’s spread (the auction is being held virtually). But across Los Angeles, social events for fans are on, including the Super Bowl Experience at the Los Angeles Convention Center downtown Sports Illustrated The Party, a bash in Century City that includes the musical guests Kygo and Jack Harlow; and the All Star Comedy Jam at the Microsoft Theater, presented by Shaquille O’Neal and LOLX, producers specializing in shows by comedians of color.
Adam Burke, the president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board, estimates that Super Bowl LVI will bring in as much as $477 million to Los Angeles County.
“We anticipate that all neighborhoods will see a boom in business thanks to the Super Bowl,” he said.

Mardi Gras
Bracing for an influx of tourists and struggling with intensive care unit staffing shortages and ballooning case numbers, the New Orleans mayor, LaToya Cantrell, made a difficult decision on Jan. 11 — she brought back the city’s indoor mask mandate.
Beginning Feb 1., everyone age 5 and up will be required to show proof of two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine (or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson version) to access indoor dining, indoor entertainment or large-scale outdoor events.
Mardi Gras, which this year falls on March 1, was a primary motivation, said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department, in a news conference. After forging ahead in 2020 and inadvertently launching one of Louisiana’s first superspreader events, the city canceled parades in 2021. “We have to double down on measures more than ever before,” she said.
This year, the celebration is expected to once again draw millions to the city. Street parties and dozens of parades are planned, many in the days leading up to Mardi Gras itself, with minor adjustments from previous years: Citing staffing limitations on the New Orleans Police Department, the city has scaled down parades and altered some routes. Endymion, one of the largest and most anticipated parades, has changed its route. Its parade takes place on Saturday, Feb. 26 (they call it Samedi Gras) and winds from the Mid-City neighborhood to the Superdome.
Returning this year: “house floats,” the elaborate decorations that took the place of parades last year.

Austin’s annual festival of music, media and movies is back in person for the first time since 2019 — sort of. SXSW was scrapped entirely in 2020 and presented as a virtual event in 2021; in 2022, it will launch on March 11 as a hybrid festival with online and in-person options. Online attendees have access to speakers like the Pfizer chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, as well as SXSW’s film, comedy and music festivals; in person, attendees can visit sites, including the XR Experience, where they can sample virtual and augmented reality; and the Wellness Expo, with fitness classes and brands peddling everything from nonalcoholic cocktails to adaptive pet mattresses that can keep hot sleepers cool.

All in-person attendees are required to either provide proof of Covid-19 vaccination or a recent negative test, although a spokesman for the festival said they had yet to define the parameters of “recent.” The test can be antigen, molecular or P.C.R. as long as it would be otherwise approved for travel clearance to the United States; many home tests would not apply. Masks will be required in all conference session rooms, exhibitions and other spaces.
The festival is also asking all in-person attendees to commit to a health pledge, which includes wearing their mask properly (over both the nose and mouth); frequently washing and sanitizing hands; and staying home if they experience any symptoms of the virus.

National Cherry Blossom Festival
Every March, the cherry blossoms burst open across Washington, D.C., in a pink flurry, which the city salutes with a four-week festival, scheduled to run from March 20 through April 17 this year. In 2020 and 2021, many events, including the festival’s flagship parade, were canceled. This year, all events are happening as planned and it’s full steam ahead, said Diana Mayhew, the festival president, albeit with a handful of adjustments.
In addition to the Blossom Kite Festival, where tens of thousands of attendees gather on the grounds of the Washington Monument to fly kites, “participants can also opt to take part in smaller kite-flying events at 10 to 14 selected parks around the city. Petalpalooza, the daylong festival of art and music at the Capitol Riverfront, is also being supplemented by several weeks of art installations, live entertainment and special restaurant menus in the same neighborhood. The parade, down Constitution Avenue, is scheduled on April 9.
“There are some people who may want to do a smaller event, with a couple hundred people versus thousands of people,” Ms. Mayhew said. “We had to think about how to be creative and innovative to make it comfortable for everybody.”

The 2022 list highlights places around the globe where travelers can be part of the solution.
Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival
The annual music and arts festival is scheduled to return to the California desert for the first time since 2019 on April 15, with 250,000 gathering at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif., for two consecutive weekends to watch the headliners, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, and Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West. But after initially announcing that all revelers would be required to show proof of vaccination against Covid-19, festival organizers reversed course in October, as virus levels were falling. Now, despite case numbers again rising — and festival passes being completely sold out — that amended policy still holds.
The entry policy requires a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours or proof of full vaccination, according to a statement on the festival’s website. The test can be molecular, P.C.R. or antigen but must have been administered by an official testing center.
Spring break
The virus has done little to dampen American appetites for boozy, sun-drenched beach breaks in the months of March and April, but it has shifted the map a bit. Data from the travel search engine Kayak shows that Orlando, Fla., is this year’s most popular Spring break destination, and among the top 10 destinations, the only international city on the list is Cancún, Mexico.
In 2019, Las Vegas held the top spot, London was among the 10 most popular destinations, and Los Angeles — which has strict mask and vaccination mandates and has since fallen to number eight — was the fourth-most visited city.

Across Florida, where masks are not required, hotels report strong bookings. Plans for pub crawls, pool parties and yacht events are up as well, according to local tourism officials.
“I am optimistic about what we will see in Orlando for the upcoming Spring break travel season,” said Casandra Matej, the president and chief executive of Visit Orlando, the local tourist board, in an email. “We continue to move closer to closing the gap to pre-pandemic visitor levels.”
But consumer behavior is still erratic, said James Moore, the general manager of The Balfour Hotel in Miami Beach, and booking windows remain short. This will be the first spring break season for The Balfour — the hotel opened last summer on Miami’s Ocean Drive, ground zero for city nightlife.
“We are seeing an influx of bookings occurring during 48 hours of check-in. Because travelers are keeping an eye on Covid, we are seeing a lot of last-minute bookings and we anticipate that happening with spring break,” he said.

Sony Interactive Entertainment, maker of the PlayStation game console and a major game developer in its own right, said Bungie, the original developer of the multiplayer shooter games Destiny and Halo, would operate independently and have free rein to publish games for other consoles and platforms. But the move could help Sony reach new game players.
“This is an important step in our strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience,” Jim Ryan, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s president and chief executive, said in a statement.

Sony and Bungie did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Microsoft acquired Bungie in 2000, and its signature title, Halo, helped turn Microsoft’s Xbox console into a major game platform. But the developer split from Microsoft in 2007 and stopped making Halo three years later. Since 2011, Halo has been developed by 343 Industries, a company owned by Microsoft.
Now, Bungie will be acquired by Microsoft’s biggest rival in the game console market: Sony. Bungie’s most popular current game is Destiny 2, which is available on multiple platforms, including the Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation."

Disney suspended its vaccine mandate for its employees in Florida because of the state’s regulations.

Red tape, red states
Now that the Biden administration’s nationwide coronavirus vaccine mandate for large companies has been overturned by the Supreme Court, employers are left to navigate a thicket of state and local rules. In New York, that means private employers have to require vaccines. In Florida and Texas, laws limit the pandemic protocols they can put in place.
And so, the companies that flocked to states like Florida and Texas in search of low taxes and light regulation have found themselves dealing with lots of red tape, at least when it comes to Covid policies. For companies with national footprints that introduced vaccine mandates, or were preparing to do so before the Supreme Court ruling, this makes designing workplace policies more complicated.
The states of play:
In Florida, where 65 percent of people are fully vaccinated, businesses must allow for an extensive list of exemptions to vaccine mandates, effectively making them moot. Violations of the rules can cost as much as $50,000 per incident.
In Texas, where 59 percent of people are fully vaccinated, Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order in October declaring that no employer could compel vaccination for someone who conscientiously objects to it. And businesses that ask customers for proof of vaccination can face stiff penalties, including the loss of a liquor license.
How big companies are reacting:
Disney suspended its national vaccine mandate for employees in Florida, as it works to keep the requirement in place for workers in California.
The Related Companies, which mandated vaccines for all of its employees in April, is no longer requiring them of its staff in Florida.
Several financial firms, including Vanguard and Blackstone, are maintaining vaccine mandates that apply only to people entering their offices.
BP, whose 3,500 Houston office employees are working remotely, is requiring employees to be vaccinated or tested twice weekly once they start going back in person.
Beyond taxes and regulation, vaccine rules could become a factor as states compete to attract business. “It’s a line that they need to straddle very carefully,” said Ian Carleton Schaefer, a partner at the law firm Loeb & Loeb. “To make sure that their politics on the vaccination issue don’t drive away the bigger-ticket issue — like making it an employer-friendly state to do business.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Pfizer will seek approval for its coronavirus vaccine for children under 5. The drug maker said it will ask the F.D.A. to authorize the expanded use; U.S. officials hope that permission will come by month’s end. Meanwhile, Moderna received full approval for its vaccine, and Novavax was seeking emergency approval for its non-mRNA vaccine.
Fed officials suggest they’ll move quickly to cool the economy. Four of the central bank’s regional governors implied yesterday that the Fed will move decisively, not gradually, to withdraw emergency financial support, given the strength of the economy.
AT&T will spin off its stake in its media business to shareholders. The telecom giant said it will give its holdings in the newly merged WarnerMedia and Discovery to its investors after that deal is completed, cleanly breaking from the media industry. It will also cut its dividend accordingly, as it had previously said it would.
Sony will buy the video game studio Bungie for $3.6 billion. The deal to buy the developer of Halo and Destiny follows Microsoft’s $69 billion deal for Activision Blizzard and other takeovers in the industry. (Ironically, Halo is exclusive to Microsoft’s Xbox; Sony said Bungie will still make games for other platforms.) Bankers say that many of the privately owned game studios are happy to remain independent — but could be swayed by richly valued bids.
Speaking of gaming M.&A. … The New York Times Company (hey, that’s us!) is buying Wordle, the hugely popular word-guessing game, for a price in the “low seven figures.” The deal is part of The Times’s plan to grow its subscriber base, but the company said the game will remain free for now.

Follow the money
As the midterm elections approach, both political parties have been amassing war chests. Yesterday was the deadline for the latest campaign finance disclosures, which show that Republicans are way ahead of Democrats, in part because of well-heeled business donors.
ADVERTISEMENT

House Republican leaders’ super PAC ended 2021 with $61 million, far ahead of the Democrats’ counterpart, thanks to seven- and eight-figure donations. Among the biggest contributors were Ken Griffin and Patrick Ryan, the founder of the insurer Aon.
Big business donors have also given to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the two Democrats who have thwarted some of President Biden’s legislative agenda:
Manchin, of West Virginia, raised nearly $300,000 days after publicly opposing Biden’s social spending plan. That came from corporate PACs tied to the likes of Anthem, CVS Health and Meta; it also came from traditional Republican donors like Ken Langone and Richard LeFrak.
Sinema, of Arizona, raised $1.6 million in the fourth quarter from G.O.P. stalwarts like Langone, George Roberts of KKR and Nelson Peltz; she also took money from groups like the American Petroleum Institute. (Her grassroots donations, however, have largely dried up.)
“We tried to figure out, ‘Where did the money go?’ — and it turns out it didn’t primarily go to workers who would have lost jobs. It went to business owners and their shareholders and their creditors.”
— David Autor, a professor at M.I.T. who studied the effects of the $800 billion Paycheck Protection Program, one of the government’s most expensive pandemic relief efforts. Only about a quarter of the money spent by the program paid wages that would have otherwise been lost.

A nuclear option on Russian sanctions
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is a messaging service that connects more than 11,000 financial institutions to enable them to transfer money. The global cooperative has tried to be apolitical, but at times it has been caught up in diplomatic disputes.
The Biden administration has threatened “severe economic consequences” for Russia if it invades Ukraine. To that end, cutting Russia off from Swift is considered a nuclear option by sanctions experts.
“The Russian economy is a different beast,” said Adam Smith, a senior sanctions official in the Obama administration. “It is twice the size of any economy the U.S. has ever sanctioned.” Last week, Biden administration officials met with big American banks to discuss the market impact of sanctions on Russia, including the ramifications of cutting it off from Swift.
Swift has been used in sanctions before. In 2012, Swift expelled Iranian financial institutions, including its central bank, to comply with E.U. sanctions. In 2014, when access to Swift was discussed as part of sanctions on Russia after it annexed Crimea, Russian leaders called it a “declaration of war.”
How would Russia respond? Russia has developed an alternative payments system since 2014, reducing the threat of losing access to Swift. “It won’t be as painful for Russia as Western officials envision,” said Maria Snegovaya, a visiting scholar at George Washington University and a co-author of an Atlantic Council report on U.S. sanctions on Russia. Sanctioning Russian banks directly, especially by cutting their ability to trade in dollars, would represent a more targeted strike.

Exclusive: Carlyle to announce 2050 net-zero commitment
The private equity firm Carlyle will announce today that it will pledge to have its portfolio companies get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, DealBook is first to report. That makes Carlyle one of the first major private equity firms to join a net-zero pledge already signed by BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and other big financial institutions.
The move by Carlyle, which has more than 250 portfolio companies and nearly $300 billion in assets under management, could put pressure on rivals like Blackstone and KKR to follow suit.
ADVERTISEMENT

Private equity firms have been holdouts on net-zero pledges. The diverse array of companies that these firms own makes it difficult to take a standardized approach. It also typically takes much longer to “decarbonize” a company than the three to five years that private equity firms tend to own their portfolio companies. But private equity is coming under pressure from pension funds, regulators and capital markets to take part in net-zero pledges.
The big question: To invest or divest? Selling carbon-intensive companies is one way to reduce a private equity portfolio’s emissions, but Carlyle’s C.E.O., Kewsong Lee, said it was “imperative that the private equity industry focus on investing, rather than divesting,” to facilitate “real progress” in the transition to cleaner energy. “We won’t invest in or finance coal-fired power generation — except if we see an opportunity to decommission those assets and repower them to lower-carbon energy sources,” said Megan Starr, Carlyle’s head of global impact.
The scope of Carlyle’s commitment: The company will report on its progress every year and by 2025 it aims for three-quarters of its portfolio companies to align with the Paris Climate Agreement. After that, it will require companies to adhere to those standards within two years of buying them. This covers so-called Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which companies can directly control, but not Scope 3 emissions, the pollution generated by a company’s suppliers and customers, which are often the most material. Carlyle’s 2050 net-zero goal does, however, include Scope 3 emissions.
What does it mean for returns? In terms of the cost to Carlyle, the firm will tackle each company by starting with investments in decarbonization that quickly make the most difference. After that, “it does get more challenging and there might be a longer payback period,” Starr said.” But because the markets now “value climate strategy so highly,” she said, the work will be worth it.

2022-02-07,"WASHINGTON — The House on Monday overwhelmingly passed legislation that would overhaul how workplace sexual assault and harassment claims are handled, approving a significant change in employment law that would effectively do away with forced arbitration in such cases, eliminating a central source of protection for the perpetrators.
The bill’s passage, 335 to 97, had broad bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate and is backed by President Biden. It came years after a major public reckoning on sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace that revealed how powerful men at some of the most prominent companies used secretive proceedings with no appeals to settle cases and silence victims. Those practices allowed the perpetrators to move on without the public learning that claims had ever been filed against them.
The bill would for the first time ensure that victims of sexual harassment and assault have the option of suing their abusers in state, tribal or federal court, invalidating any contract that closed off the option — a common condition of employment at many companies.
House passage was the first step in a quick push to usher the legislation into law. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said Monday that the Senate would take it up later in the week, and the White House has indicated that Mr. Biden will sign it.
“The Weinsteins, the Cosbys, the Roger Ailes and the Bill O’ Reillys of the world used mandatory arbitration to force women into secrecy,” said Nancy Erika Smith, an employment lawyer who represented Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host, in her landmark sexual harassment case against Mr. Ailes, the former chief executive of Fox News. “They stayed in positions of power and continued to abuse women.”
Ms. Carlson’s 2016 case, which Fox News settled for $20 million, and her subsequent activism on the issue was also the beginning of the effort in Congress to change the law, which has brought together an unlikely coalition of liberals and conservatives.

Banking on it
Big banks are responding to the “Great Resignation” by writing big checks. To keep workers from leaving, Wall Street institutions have been raising pay and bonuses for everyone from senior executives to junior bankers. The thing is, it may not be enough, The Times’s Lananh Nguyen reports.
Job churn at the country’s biggest banks is accelerating, fueled by a war for finance talent, both inside and outside the industry, and burnout from working punishingly long hours during the pandemic. “I was just so tired of it. It wasn’t making me happy,” said Amy Wu Stratton, who left Citi in June, even though it was her most lucrative year after almost 16 years in banking. “The pandemic slowed me down and made me take stock.”
The six biggest banks collectively spent nearly $178 billion on compensation last year, up 12 percent from the year before. Steven Eckhaus, a Wall Street employment lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery, said he had negotiated a handful of eight-figure pay packages on behalf of top bankers in the past few months, including a $20 million signing bonus for a client after a four-month bidding war. At the other end of the scale, the typical base pay for recent graduates in their first or second year on Wall Street has reached $100,000, from about $85,000, and that’s before bonuses.
But “money doesn’t always make you happy,” said Alan Johnson of Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consultancy. Some bankers are moving elsewhere in finance, to smaller banks where they can have more control over their hours or to fast-growing fintech and crypto firms. Others are leaving finance altogether. Stratton left Citi to start a website for Asian women who are focused on careers and social impact. “I was so happy to get out of that thinking of always having more and more,” she said.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The U.S. trade deficit soars. The deficit rose 27 percent last year, to nearly $860 billion. The reason: Americans bought mountains of imported goods, while the U.S. suffered a drop in demand for its services, particularly with foreigners spending far less on tourism and education.
Americans take on more debt. Borrowing rose at the fastest pace since before the financial crisis, driven by purchases of homes and cars, according to economists at the New York Fed. But they said that they weren’t too concerned, given the overall rise in wealth during the pandemic.
Johnson & Johnson pauses production of its Covid vaccine. The company quietly shut down the only plant that produces the shot and manufactured another, potentially more lucrative vaccine unrelated to the coronavirus, The Times reports. While the halt is expected to be temporary, it came after J.&J. had already fallen behind on deliveries to poorer countries.
A bipartisan effort to ban congressional stock trading emerges. Senators Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, will propose preventing lawmakers and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks, according to Axios.
Meta’s woes may provide an unexpected benefit. The drop in shares of Facebook’s parent company lowered its market cap to just below $600 billion — the threshold for proposed Big Tech antitrust regulation in the House. But those bills are far from becoming law, and legislators could revise that limit.

Our notes on Peloton
Peloton’s major shake-up yesterday made waves, not least in the connected fitness company’s share price, which rose 25 percent, regaining some — but not nearly all — of its decline over the past year. We shared our initial thoughts about the moves in yesterday’s newsletter, and then spent the day talking with sources about what happens next. Here’s what we learned:
On Barry McCarthy. The appeal of Peloton’s new C.E.O., who was formerly the finance chief of Spotify and Netflix, is clear: He knows how to run a subscription business. And having worked alongside the founders of those companies, McCarthy knows how to do the same with Peloton’s co-founder, John Foley, who in shifting to executive chairman from C.E.O. won’t be going far.
Image
On turning around the business. Peloton is looking to save $800 million annually by cutting costs on staff, marketing, real estate and more. It also faces a challenge in moving mounting inventory, which reflects slowing demand for its bikes and treadmills. But when — or if — Peloton can reduce its losses, it will need a strategy beyond emergency resuscitation. Could that include partnerships? Or increasing the price of its streaming plans?
On those takeover rumors. We quizzed Wall Street sources on what McCarthy’s hiring meant for a potential sale, as the activist investor Blackwells Capital has urged. Overwhelmingly, the answer was that hiring someone like McCarthy signals that there isn’t an immediate plan to sell the company. Peloton may still do a deal, but as a source told DealBook: “It buys them some time.”
The couple behind the crypto heist
The Justice Department yesterday said it had seized over $3.6 billion worth of stolen Bitcoin and arrested a married couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, accused of laundering the crypto. It’s a case full of big numbers — and other eye-catching details.

The stash is the department’s largest financial seizure ever. About 119,754 Bitcoin was stolen in 2016 from the Bitfinex exchange, according to prosecutors. (It was worth $71 million at the time of the heist and is now valued at over $4.5 billion.) Law enforcement officials recovered 94,636 Bitcoin, valued at more than $3.6 billion, from a wallet belonging to Lichtenstein.
The couple now face charges of money laundering. The pair, who describe themselves as entrepreneurs, led a flashy life. Morgan in particular has built up a outsized public profile, writing for Forbes and Inc. and rapping under the name Razzlekhan, the self-described “crocodile of Wall Street.” (Here are some of her music videos.) They posted online often and publicly about crypto: “The amount of spam I’m getting about sketchy crypto get rich stuff really makes me feel like this bubble is gonna pop soon!” Morgan tweeted in December.
Are unions on the rise?
Headlines suggest that the unionization movement in the U.S. seems to be gaining momentum. It certainly has support from the Biden administration, which issued a report this week outlining dozens of steps it will take to promote union membership. Here are some of the recent union developments making news:
Congressional staff members started a unionization effort last week,  noting that they are employed by politicians who say they support the labor movement. Before their workers can unionize, however, House members must pass a resolution allowing it. Representative Andy Levin, Democrat of Michigan, plans to do that this week. President Biden supports the union drive, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said yesterday.
Starbucks workers in California this week joined their counterparts in more than 50 locations in 19 states, pushing for union elections after the first company-owned store unionized in Buffalo, N.Y. at the end of last year. Yesterday, the company fired several employees in Memphis who were seeking to unionize their store, for what the company said were violations of safety and security policies.
Amazon faces another union vote at a warehouse in Alabama, after the National Labor Relations Board threw out the results, citing misconduct by the company. A rerun of the vote started last week, and workers at a Staten Island warehouse also recently collected enough signatures to warrant a vote.
Media companies are making news for workers’ unionization drives (including at The New York Times). One of the latest is The Financial Times’s U.S. newsroom.
Image
But taking a step back, union membership is on the decline, to just above 10 percent of the U.S. work force last year, half the share of the early 1980s. In absolute terms, union rolls have lost about four million members over that period.
Image
What’s in a bank?
Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s nominee to lead bank supervision at the Fed, faces stiff resistance from Republicans based on her progressive positions and on apparent ethical questions that some believe are really intended to push one state’s cryptocurrency agenda.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Republicans questioned Raskin’s contacts with the Kansas City Fed. Raskin, a former Fed governor, joined the board of a fintech company that was approved for a Fed “master account,” and faced questions about these dealings at her confirmation hearing. The Kansas City Fed responded on Monday, saying communication with company directors is “routine.” But Senator Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, said yesterday that the real problem was that a “connected non-bank” secured Fed approval while requests from “actual banks” in her state “have been stonewalled.” Wyoming created the Special Purpose Depository Institution, or SPDI (pronounced “speedy”), a new kind of financial institution that handles digital assets.
It all depends on how you define “bank.” Lee Reiners, a Duke University law school fintech expert and a former New York Fed lawyer, told DealBook that Lummis’s “outlandish accusations” are actually part of a wider effort to pressure the Fed into “letting lightly regulated crypto companies into the national payment system.” Lummis characterizes Wyoming’s applicants for Fed access as “banks,” but Reiners says that SPDIs do not meet the definition of banks under the current rules. (Lummis declined to comment when contacted by DealBook.)
“We have to think about the broader safety and soundness implications,” the Fed chair, Jay Powell, said at his renomination hearing last month in response to Lummis’s questions about granting SPDIs access to Fed master accounts. There are “good arguments” in favor, Powell said, but it would be “hugely precedential, which is why I’m taking my time.”
All five of Biden’s Fed nominees, including Raskin, are set for a vote by the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 15. Yesterday, in a letter, 20 high-profile economists urged Senate leaders to confirm the nominees.

The job market has been affected by the pandemic and other factors.

Pay vs. prices
This morning, the government will report inflation data for January. Economists expect that prices continued to climb at the fastest pace in 40 years. But how much workers feel the effects of inflation depends on whether wages, which have also been growing fast, can keep pace with rising prices. DealBook turned to Ben Casselman, an economics reporter at The Times, for his thoughts. Here’s what he said:
First, there’s almost no question that wages, in the aggregate, have risen less than inflation over the past year. Over the full pandemic, real wages — meaning after inflation — are probably up, but below their prepandemic trend.
Second, it’s totally possible to argue that wage growth will remain strong even if inflation moderates, leading to real gains for workers. There are two flavors of that argument:
In one version, the pandemic has spurred productivity-enhancing investments. In addition, it’s possible that there has been a composition shift in the economy toward more high-productivity sectors. And some of those shifts could be permanent, even after the pandemic. That means, for example, more Zoom meetings and less business travel, which could allow for more output with fewer hours, and hence faster real wage growth.
The other possibility is that inflation and wages are being driven, largely, by different forces right now. Inflation is mostly about elevated spending, especially on goods, running into supply-chain disruptions. Wages are being driven by labor shortages, which give workers more bargaining power. Those two forces have some of the same underlying causes — like excess savings allowing people to sit out of the labor market and spend more — but they’re sufficiently distinct that you could imagine inflation abating while wage pressures remain strong.
Those are two very different stories. One is about the pie growing larger; the other is about workers getting a bigger share of the pie. (Remember, labor’s share of national income — that is, the amount of G.D.P. that gets paid out to workers — has been falling for decades, so there’s plenty of room for it to rise.) Then again, it’s also possible that wages will continue to lag behind inflation, or at least won’t outpace it, leaving workers treading water, at best.

Leonard Green joins the hunt for Kohl’s. The private equity firm has expressed its interest in bidding for the retailer, two people familiar with the matter told DealBook. The firm may not submit an offer, but its interest is notable, given its expertise in retail. (Leonard Green declined to comment.) Kohl’s has said that it was working with PJT Partners and Goldman Sachs to field interest, after takeover approaches from the private equity firm Sycamore and a consortium backed by Starboard Value — which the retailer has rejected as too low.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi signals an openness to banning lawmakers’ stock trades. As bipartisan support for the ban grows, even Pelosi — whose husband’s lucrative trades have drawn criticism — suggested she may be open to such measures. One steadfast opponent is Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, who violated congressional reporting rules on disclosing trades 132 times last year.
Tech stocks show mixed fortunes. Twitter said today that its fourth-quarter revenue grew more slowly than analysts expected and that it would report a loss in the current quarter. Investors have been worried about a slide in its business, with one prominent shareholder, the fund manager Cathie Wood, selling down her holdings recently. Meanwhile, Uber’s earnings highlighted rising revenue and passenger numbers as signs of a comeback in its core ride-hailing business.
States and businesses are dropping mask rules. More Democratic governors relaxed coronavirus restrictions in their states, while federal officials cautiously suggested that the U.S. was headed toward “more normality.” CVS said it expected demand for coronavirus tests and vaccines to drop this year.

Microsoft’s charm offensive
Microsoft laid out its pitch to regulators in Washington yesterday as it sought approval for its $70 billion deal to buy the video game maker Activision. The company is positioning itself as the friendly face of Big Tech, drawing distinctions with Google, Apple and Amazon, which have attracted the ire of lawmakers and regulators for their market power.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Microsoft also has to convince investors that the deal can pass regulatory muster: Activision’s shares are trading at $81.50, far below the $95 price Microsoft has offered, implying that there are some doubts that the deal will get done.

Microsoft announced an 11-point pledge for a “principled approach to app stores.” It promised not to give preferential treatment to its own games in its app stores and said it would not force developers to use its payment system to process in-app payments (the center of the legal fight between Apple and Epic Games). If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s what the Open App Markets Act, which recently passed the Senate, calls on Apple and Google to do.
Other tech giants have bristled at Microsoft’s strategy. Google’s head of global affairs has criticized Microsoft for supporting an act targeting its competitors, while not applying the same restrictions on its Xbox store. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said the company was “committed” to applying the promises on preferential treatment and payments to the Xbox store “over time.”
Microsoft also needs to convince regulators outside of Washington. Microsoft said yesterday it would need approval from 17 governments to get the Activision deal done. “We want to be clear with regulators and with the public that if this acquisition is approved, they can count on Microsoft to adapt to the rules that are emerging,” Smith said.
In other news, Discovery and AT&T cleared a significant regulatory hurdle to their plan to merge into one of the biggest media companies in the country, saying that the combination “satisfied the closing condition” of an antitrust review by the Justice Department.

The S.E.C. had a busy day
The S.E.C. wants to make private equity a bit less private, advancing a proposal for new rules to shed more light on the roughly $18 trillion industry. At a meeting of S.E.C. commissioners yesterday, the agency also proposed shortening settlement time for trades and requiring more disclosures of cybersecurity policies and episodes. These rules are now put out for public comment, where they could be altered based on feedback (and lobbying) before being put to a final vote, a process that could take all year to finalize.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The private equity industry is likely to resist the rules on more transparency. If the proposals are approved, private equity firms and hedge funds would have to provide more information to investors, including quarterly statements detailing performance, fees and expenses. The funds would also be subject to more record-keeping and audits, limits on giving particular investors preferential treatment, and prohibitions on charging certain fees and expenses to a fund. (Last month, the S.E.C. also proposed rules that would require private funds to share more information about their investments confidentially with regulators.)
Drew Maloney of the American Investment Council, a trade group that represents private equity, said that “these new regulations are unnecessary and will not strengthen pension returns or help companies innovate and compete in a global marketplace.”
Steve Nelson of Institutional Limited Partners Association, a trade group representing pension funds and other investors, said the rules could “help address the increased conflict of interest” in the private equity industry.
Speeding up settlement times would be a stock market makeover. The S.E.C.’s plan would shorten the time it takes to complete a stock trade, cutting the current two-day period in half. In a report on the meme-stock frenzy last year, the agency said that speeding up settlement could reduce liquidity demands that clearinghouses put on brokers, which the online broker Robinhood said forced it to limit trading in some stocks when they were in high demand.
Better cybersecurity practices would reduce risks and bolster investor confidence, the agency said. Proposed new rules for investment companies would require written cybersecurity policies and procedures, record-keeping and reporting of cybersecurity episodes. “Cyber incidents, unfortunately, happen a lot,” Gary Gensler, the S.E.C. chair, said in a statement.

2022-02-11,"In early January, two days after an abrupt announcement that the top editor of Slate was stepping down, the publication’s staff signed into a Zoom meeting with the company’s chief executive and a consultant for Graham Holdings, the publication's owner.
Slate was not profitable, the consultant, Ann McDaniel, told them. She had been brought in to suggest ways to improve the publication and shore up its business, she said, according to five staff members at the meeting.
When asked about what needed to be fixed, Ms. McDaniel pointed to Slate’s website, saying it was unattractive and suggesting that more resources needed to be put into the design team, according to the people.
Ms. McDaniel’s comments came as a surprise, said the people at the meeting. But it was not the only indication to the staff that Slate was in a tough spot.

Making money from an online publication continues to be a tricky business, even for established brands like Slate. Many digital media companies have merged in recent years, hoping that by joining forces they can compete with the likes of Google and Facebook for online advertising dollars.
Slate made its first move to build revenue through subscriptions instead of relying on advertising in 2014, with a membership program called Slate Plus. The company plans to soon double the cost of renewing subscriptions to Slate Plus to $119, from $59.
Navigating the fast-changing digital media landscape has left Slate struggling to define its identity, said three of the staff members who were at the meeting, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisals. Slate once stood out as a home for contrarian takes and intellectual debate, but that distinction has faded in recent years, they said.
The questions about its mission have increased after several high-level departures this year, the people said. The departure of Jared Hohlt, who had been the editor in chief since 2019, was followed a couple weeks later by Allison Benedikt, a longtime staff member who was a top editor. Other departures last month included Gabriel Roth, the head of podcasts; Laura Bennett, the editorial director; and William Saletan, a writer who had worked for Slate for 25 years.

Dan Check, Slate’s chief executive, acknowledged in an interview that there was work to be done on figuring out Slate’s editorial vision, but added: “We are definitely not in any kind of a crisis.”
“Right now we’re kind of taking a breath and taking a look at what it is that we’re doing — taking stock,” Mr. Check said.
Slate, which was started in 1996 by Microsoft, was one of the original digital-only media outlets. The publication quickly became known for smart analysis, interesting debate and top-tier journalistic talent. (Jacob Weisberg, a former Slate editor in chief, described Slate in 2013 as having “the brain of The New York Times and the body of BuzzFeed.”)
In 2004, Microsoft sold Slate to The Washington Post Company. After Jeff Bezos bought the firm’s flagship newspaper in 2013, the parent company was renamed Graham Holdings.

In recent years, Slate invested in starting podcasts and found success with some, including the acclaimed “Slow Burn.” And it remains known for its reporting on the Supreme Court, long an area of specialty. But it has struggled to otherwise break through in the conversation.
Confusion over exactly what Slate stands for has grown among staff, sometimes bleeding into public comments. An internal debate last year over race resulted in Mike Pesca, a well-known podcast host, leaving the company. Mr. Pesca, who is white, had argued with colleagues that there were certain contexts in which people who were not Black should be allowed to quote a racial slur. He was suspended in February last year and Slate started an investigation. A Slate spokeswoman said at the time that the suspension was not based around Mr. Pesca “making an isolated abstract argument in a Slack channel.”
Mr. Pesca left Slate in September and took the podcast “The Gist” with him. Last month, he told Tablet Magazine that Slate’s staff had criticized him because “their politics were different from mine and because their definition of the value of dissent differed from mine.”
Mr. Saletan, in his last article for Slate, wrote that “at Slate and many other publications, the range of political perspectives has shifted in ways that exacerbate our echo chamber problem.”
Mr. Saletan described a shift in both political parties toward the fringes and away from the middle, and he said it had meant partisans rarely engaged with opposing views. He declined to comment for this article.

Mr. Check said the publication wanted to “make sure that we have a range of viewpoints on the site going forward.” He added: “Slate is straight up more diverse than it ever has been before.”
Mr. Check said he already had promoted some staff members into leadership positions. The search for an editor in chief was continuing, he said.
Mr. Check said he had asked Graham Holdings for help strengthening Slate’s business, which had led to Ms. McDaniel’s involvement as an adviser.
Several staff members said Ms. McDaniel had been blunt in her assessment of Slate, which some found refreshing. Her criticism of the design of the website offended some in the art department, but she also suggested that more resources should be put into it, the people said. Slate hasn’t had an art director for the past couple of years, the people said.
Mr. Check said that Slate had seen “really strong growth” in its membership program in the last two years. A Slate spokeswoman said that subscriptions to Slate Plus, which allows users to access ad-free versions of its podcasts and to read an unlimited number of articles on Slate.com, were up 16 percent in 2021 from the previous year.

“We’re a digital media company and we know that that’s a difficult business,” Mr. Check said. He said the focus this year would be on growing revenue from subscriptions and from podcast advertising.
“We’re not particularly far away from getting to a sustainable point,” he said, “but we still have some work to do to get there.”"

What’s Up? (Feb. 6-12)
Peloton Hits a Steep Hill
Early in the pandemic, with gyms closed and people stuck at home, demand for Peloton’s bikes and virtual classes soared. So did its share price. But sales growth has slowed as gyms and fitness studios reopened. The company’s outlook has not been helped by a recall of its treadmills over safety concerns and fictional characters suffering heart attacks while riding its bikes in not just one, but two popular television shows. Peloton has been forced to hit the brakes, halting production of its bikes and treadmills, scratching plans for a new factory in Ohio and on Tuesday announcing that it would lay off 2,800 workers, about 20 percent of its work force. The company’s founder, John Foley, said he would step down as chief executive and become executive chairman. Barry McCarthy, a former chief financial officer of Spotify, was named chief executive and president.
Inflation Sticks
Speaking of hills, prices continued their steep upward trajectory in January, according to new numbers released by the Department of Labor on Thursday. The Consumer Price Index, a key measure of inflation, showed that prices have climbed 7.5 percent over the past year. While increases in car prices, which were mostly because of pandemic supply chain issues, moderated somewhat, the cost of food, rent, electricity and other services continued to rise, suggesting that there are more than just pandemic factors at play. That could put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cool the economy. Investors now expect the Fed to raise interest rates by half a point in March, rather than its standard quarter-point increase.
Big Deals Under Review
The Biden administration has made cracking down on corporate consolidation a priority, an effort that started last year with hiring the most aggressive antitrust enforcement team in decades. Regulators’ concerns came into play in several big deals last week. On Monday, the Silicon Valley chip maker Nvidia announced that it would end its efforts to buy Arm, which licenses chip technology, because of “significant regulatory challenges.” The same day, Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines announced plans to merge, a deal that would create the fifth-largest airline by market share and could also face opposition from regulators. (The Justice Department sued to prevent American Airlines and JetBlue Airways from merging last year.) Microsoft also began lobbying for approval of its $70 billion deal to buy the video game company Activision Blizzard, which would be the largest deal in its history, by promising to keep Activision franchises like Call of Duty available on other platforms and to not require game makers to use its payment systems. And Discovery and AT&T cleared a significant regulatory hurdle on Wednesday in their deal to combine Discovery and WarnerMedia, which would create one of the biggest media companies in the United States.

The ‘Crypto Bowl’
In the latest sign that crypto has become mainstream — if not in transactions, in conversation — at least three online services for buying and selling cryptocurrencies will run ads during Sunday’s Super Bowl. Brands that have nothing or little to do with the blockchain, including Bud Light, Expedia and TurboTax, will also reference the technology in their ads. About 100 million people are expected to watch the game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals, and NBC Universal charged up to $7 million for a 30-second commercial during the event.

The Ripple Effects of Trucker Protests
Protests by truckers angry about vaccination requirements have already taken an economic toll that could spread in the coming days and weeks. The protests have blocked major border crossings between Canada and the United States, including main routes for steel, aluminum and other car parts needed by factories in both countries. In response, Toyota, Ford Motors and Honda have cut production at factories in Michigan and Ontario. The parts shortages will first affect smaller auto parts suppliers, independent truckers and workers whose hours have been cut with production, which could also affect communities heavily dependent on the auto industry as workers spend less on goods and services. “If it stretches on for weeks, it could be catastrophic,” said Peter Nagle, an analyst at the research firm IHS Markit who covers the car industry.
Masks Come Off
The governors of New York, Rhode Island, and Illinois announced an end to their statewide indoor mask mandates on Wednesday, adding to a growing list of city and state governments that have eased pandemic rules in recent weeks. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not changed its recommendation that people wear masks in schools and public indoor spaces in places where the virus is surging. As a patchwork of mandates expire, it will be left to businesses previously covered by the rules to decide for themselves whether to require masks.

With the Omicron wave receding, many places are starting to remove at least some of their remaining pandemic restrictions.
This shift could have large benefits. It could reduce the isolation and disruption that have contributed to a long list of societal ills, like rising mental-health problems, drug overdoses, violent crime and, as Substack’s Matthew Yglesias has written, “all kinds of bad behavior.”
But the removal of restrictions has downsides, too. Millions of Americans remain vulnerable to Covid. The largest group of the vulnerable, by far, is the unvaccinated, who have the ability to protect themselves and have chosen not to.
Another group of people, however, have done what they can to stay healthy — by getting vaccinated — and yet remain vulnerable. They include the elderly and people with immunodeficiencies that put them at greater Covid risk. According to the C.D.C., more than 75 percent of vaccinated people who have died from Covid had at least four medical risk factors.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Today’s newsletter focuses on five steps that can help protect the vulnerable as society moves back toward normal.
At this point in the pandemic, there is a strong argument that a targeted approach — lifting restrictions while taking specific measures to protect the vulnerable — can maximize public health. The right approach, Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me, involves “moving away from broad, blunt tools to more precision tools.”
The public conversation often misses this middle ground. It can sometimes seem to be a debate between doing everything to slow the spread of Covid and doing nothing, said Katelyn Jetelina of the University of Texas, who writes a helpful newsletter about public health. In truth, she said, “There has to be a balance.”
1. Vaccines and boosters
I want to start by emphasizing the importance of the vaccines, including the booster shots. Consider this chart, based on C.D.C. data:
Weekly hospitalizations for U.S. adults age 50-64
100 hospitalizations per 100,000
Unvaccinated
80
60
40
20
Vaccinated,
no booster
With booster
Nov. 6, 2021
Dec. 18, 2021
Note: Based on data from 14 U.S. jurisdictions.Source: Centers for Disease Control and PreventionBy The New York Times
Yes, some Americans remain so opposed to a Covid vaccination that there is little chance of persuading them. But others may still choose to receive shots if they are readily available. Booster shots are vital, too, to overcome waning protection. Boosters are especially important for the vulnerable vaccinated — the elderly and immunocompromised.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Vaccination is the most valuable intervention we can do,” William Hanage, an infectious-disease expert at Harvard, told me.
2. High-quality masks
For the vulnerable vaccinated, the best approach is what epidemiologists calls “the Swiss cheese model.” It’s a multifaceted approach in which each strategy, including vaccines, has holes. But when the strategies are layered on top of one another, the holes tend to disappear.
One such layer is masking with an N95 or KN95 medical mask, even if others are maskless. “One-way masking works,” as Olga Khazan of The Atlantic has written.
Joseph Allen of Harvard has argued that somebody wearing an N95 mask and talking to an unmasked person is at less risk than somebody who’s wearing a standard surgical mask and talking to another person wearing a standard mask. “Let’s dispense with the notion that masks are only protective if everyone is wearing them,” Allen wrote in The Washington Post.
Here’s a Wirecutter guide to buying N95 and KN95 masks, and here’s how to spot a fake.
3. A preventive drug
In December, the F.D.A. authorized a drug called Evusheld, made by AstraZeneca. It is designed to be an additional layer of protection on top of the vaccines, to prevent Covid in immunocompromised people.
The Biden administration has bought 1.7 million doses, which is not enough to protect every American who could benefit but is significant. A larger immediate problem is confusion around the distribution. Many people don’t know Evusheld exists or don’t know how to find out if they’re eligible and how to get a shot.
Rob Relyea, an engineer at Microsoft whose wife has cancer, has created an online resource, in the absence of information from official sources. The country needs a “better communication plan around Evusheld,” Relyea tweeted. “Each hospital should proactively reach out to immunocompromised patients.”
The confusion around Evusheld is another example of how the fragmented U.S. health care system harms people.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
4. Rapid tests
One piece of recent good news is the increased availability of rapid Covid tests, at drugstores and elsewhere.
Rapid tests are an important tool for allowing the elderly and immunocompromised to socialize confidently with friends and family. Stefanie Friedhoff of Brown University’s School of Public Health has written about a friend of hers who leaves a batch of tests in her hallway for people to take before they visit her husband, who has Parkinson’s disease.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
5. Post-infection treatments
Rapid tests can also help vulnerable people find out when they have contracted Covid — and quickly begin a treatment to reduce its severity. “Time is critical, as close to symptom onset as possible,” Dr. Paul Sax of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston notes.
Although some post-infection treatments no longer work against Omicron, others, like remdesivir, seem to. The most effective treatment may be Paxlovid, a Pfizer drug designed to fight Covid.
Unfortunately, these treatments can also be difficult to locate. My colleague Rebecca Robbins has written about her maddening search to find one for her mother, who’s 73 and has had cancer. Rebecca had to locate Paxlovid herself, at a Rite Aid 60 miles from her mother’s home, and hire an Uber driver to pick it up.
The supply of Paxlovid, in both the U.S. and other countries, will expand rapidly in coming months, which should help. Yet some of the logistical hurdles will surely remain. (Related, from Times Opinion: “Covid drugs may work well, but our health system doesn’t.”)
The bottom line
Vulnerable people — and their families — can take some big steps to protect themselves, including high-quality masks and rapid tests. But government agencies, hospitals and doctor’s offices can also play a crucial role, helping people locate potentially lifesaving treatments. “It’s incumbent upon policymakers to give people the tools to do that,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former F.D.A. commissioner, said on CBS yesterday.
One final point: Some of these issues are not unique to Covid. The flu, for example, kills more than 30,000 Americans a year, most of them elderly or immunocompromised. If Covid can focus the country on finding better ways to protect them in the future, it would be one silver lining from a tragic pandemic.

A $5.7 billion mystery
In an inconspicuous fashion — via a regulatory filing with the S.E.C. — Elon Musk disclosed that he gave nearly $6 billion worth of Tesla shares to charity last year, instantly propelling him into the upper ranks of philanthropic donors. But the document gave little information about where the Tesla C.E.O. directed his wealth.
Musk donated just over five million shares in November, according to the filing. Based on the average price of Tesla shares on the days he sold, that is worth roughly $5.7 billion. That would make him the second-biggest donor last year, behind only Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates and their $15 billion in giving, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
The gift came as Musk sold many more billions in stock. He sold more than $16 billion worth of shares in November and December, much of which was meant to cover tax obligations after exercising stock options. At the time, Musk tweeted that he would be likely to pay over $11 billion in taxes, one of the biggest individual bills in U.S. history. The stock donation could be useful in defraying that bill.
The question is where those shares went. The donation came as Musk argued with populist lawmakers like the senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren about wealth inequality and taxes. Several observers noted that weeks before his donation, Musk tweeted that he would give $6 billion if the U.N. could prove that money could help solve world hunger. Days afterward, the U.N.’s World Food Program outlined how it would spend $6.6 billion to help avert famine.
Musk’s other disclosed philanthropic efforts include millions in gifts to Texas municipalities and a $100 million prize for developing technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the air.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Canada declares a national emergency to end trucker protests. The move by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — which lets the government take actions like freezing protesters’ bank accounts — comes as antigovernment demonstrations continue to paralyze Ottawa. Meanwhile, North American automakers restarted production after the Canadian authorities cleared protesters from a key trade route to the U.S.
Donald Trump’s accounting firm cuts ties and retracts financial statements. In a court filing, Mazars USA said it could no longer stand behind a decades’ worth of work prepared for the former president. The statements are at the center of two law enforcement investigations into whether Trump exaggerated the value of his properties to defraud lenders.
Texas sues Meta over facial recognition data. The lawsuit accuses Facebook’s parent company of collecting biometric data for more than a decade without users’ informed consent. The action comes a year after Facebook settled a similar lawsuit in Illinois for $650 million; Texas is seeking “billions” in damages.
BlockFi settles an S.E.C. investigation for $100 million. Products offered by the company that let customers deposit cryptocurrencies into interest-bearing accounts were essentially investment contracts, and should have been registered as securities, the regulator said. The move may provide regulatory clarity for other crypto companies hoping to offer similar products.
Berkshire Hathaway strikes gold with a timely investment in Activision Blizzard. The conglomerate bought a $1 billion stake in the video-game maker weeks before it agreed to sell itself to Microsoft for nearly $70 billion, according to a quarterly investment disclosure. Other news from these regulatory filings: Several firms made poorly timed purchases of Peloton stock, and the hedge fund D.E.

The business costs of a figure skating scandal
Arbitrators cleared the Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva to continue competing in the Beijing Olympics, despite having failed a doping test in December, though Olympics officials will withhold medals in any event where she places in the top three until her case is resolved. The stunning turn of events has caused an uproar, so DealBook has taken a look at the potential financial impact.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The skaters: Valieva is likely to finish in the top three in any event in which she participates, meaning that there probably won’t be any medal ceremony. That would deprive athletes of a prime publicity opportunity from which to secure lucrative sponsorship deals. The U.S. skater Adam Rippon, who shot to fame after his Olympics feats in 2018, was among those who decried the move: “The ladies event tomorrow is a complete joke,” he tweeted yesterday.
Figure skating: Skaters and their families openly worried that the incident could tarnish the sport, which has already suffered a decline in viewership since the 2002 Olympic judging scandal. There’s precedent for such concerns: Revelations of widespread doping led to T-Mobile withdrawing its sponsorship of professional cycling in 2007.
Viewership: Research by Jeffrey Cisyk, an associate principal at Charles River Associates, found that steroid suspensions in baseball led to a drop in attendance of at least 8 percent. Such fan boycotts have tended to be fleeting, lasting around 30 days — but the Beijing Olympics have only about a week to go, and women’s figure skating, one of its marquee events, starts today. NBC is already suffering record low ratings for this year’s games, so it may be hoping that the Valieva incident will instead draw in the curious, as the Tonya Harding scandal did.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Olympics itself. Sponsors of this year’s Games have already been unusually silent about their ties to the event amid criticism of Beijing’s human rights record, and Russian athletes were already competing under an independent banner because of another doping scandal. The Valieva affair might mean that “some corporations will question whether the Olympics still align with its core values,” Cisyk told DealBook. Could that lead to difficulty recruiting future host cities, especially given the huge costs of holding the games?

2022-02-16,"The stock market has lately soured on the technology industry. Stock prices of many of the largest companies are down this year, some slightly — shares of Apple and Google have fallen more than 6 percent — and some stupendously: Facebook's parent company, Meta, and Netflix have lost about a third of their value since the New Year. Because surging tech stocks drove a big part of the stock market’s rise in 2021, their decline has contributed much to the market’s fall. The S & P 500 is down by about 7 percent in 2022.
It’s obvious why investors are spooked. Omicron, inflation, likely interest rate hikes, a possible war in Europe, Canadians acting very un-Canadianly — unpredictable forces have taken hold of the global economy, so it’s not unreasonable to expect trouble ahead for some of the largest companies in the world.
But in the last few weeks, as corporations announced their financial performance for the final months of 2021, I’ve found it hard to focus on what might now go wrong for the tech industry.
Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft — the four American companies now worth more than a trillion dollars each (actually, Microsoft is above $2 trillion, and Apple nearly $3 trillion) — reported enviable growth in 2021. Even Facebook’s disappointing earnings were relative: The company’s profits grew by 35 percent in 2021, down from nearly 60 percent growth in 2020.

So the much bigger story is that after all that has gone right during the pandemic for the largest companies in tech, they now seem poised to expand their reach and influence over the rest of the economy, rather than relinquish it.

Perhaps it’s not very surprising that the largest tech companies did really well during a pandemic that had a lot of us spending lots more time with technology. Yet the scale of their growth is staggering.
As Chaim Gartenberg of The Verge pointed out, Apple’s revenue grew by more than $90 billion in 2021, about a third more than its revenue in 2020 — and this despite a global shortage of computer chips. Amazon’s sales in 2021 were 67 percent larger than in 2019, the year before the pandemic; Google’s 2021 revenue was nearly 60 percent greater than in 2019.
I’ve worn down my thesaurus looking for superlatives to underline how gobsmacking these numbers are. These were already among the largest corporations ever to have existed; in 2018, Apple became the first American company to reach a trillion-dollar market valuation. Companies of that size are just not supposed to grow as quickly as they have. For years, pundits have been predicting that tech giants would eventually run up against the so-called “law of large numbers.” Yet Big Tech keeps breaking the law.
What’s driving tech giants’ stupefying growth? It’s not just that the pandemic drove a lot more usage of tech. A bigger deal, I think, is that the pandemic illustrated how much room there still is in our lives for adding even more tech — for our screens to become the primary portal through which a handful of companies capture a slice of everything we do.

Consider, for instance, Apple’s “services” business — a division that includes, among other things, its App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud and its music and TV subscription plans. Traditionally Apple has made a huge amount of money from selling hardware. But iPhone sales have gone up and down over the past half decade, which makes sense; eventually everyone who wants an iPhone will have an iPhone, and with each new iPhone only slightly better than the last, people will have fewer reasons to upgrade. Indeed, iPhone sales in Apple’s holiday quarter in 2021 grew by 9 percent over 2020 — solid, but nothing like the growth Apple once saw with the iPhone.
And so Apple has increasingly turned to subscriptions and other online services for growth — essentially a way to grow not just by selling more iPhones, but by getting more money from each iPhone user. The plan is working spectacularly well. Apple reported that during 2020 its App Store billing and sales revenue grew by 24 percent over the previous year. Luca Maestri, Apple’s finance chief, told investors last month that the company now has 785 million paying subscribers to its various offerings — a number that grew by 165 million in the past year. For some perspective: Netflix has about 222 million subscribers in total.
You see a similar trend across the industry — Big Tech’s not just getting more customers for its traditional businesses, but is expanding its ancillary businesses in ways that seem impossible. Amazon, for example, is not just an indomitable retailer and the largest cloud services provider (its Amazon Web Services cloud business now has a $71 billion annual revenue run rate). The company also disclosed that its advertising business generated $31 billion in revenue in 2021, while Microsoft said its ad revenue exceeded $10 billion. Remember that ads are, in the scheme of things, a small part of the business for both companies — Amazon’s $31 billion ad business is not even 10 percent of its annual revenue. And yet it dwarfs companies whose entire business is mainly ads — Snap, for example, which had $4 billion in revenue in 2021, or Pinterest, which sold less than $2.6 billion in ads.
Dan Ives and John Katsingris, analysts at the investment firm Wedbush Securities, wrote in a recent report that what we are seeing now is only the beginning of a long-term explosion in tech earnings. They estimated that companies would spend a trillion dollars on cloud services over the coming years, meaning that there is a lot more room for tech companies to keep growing and growing and growing. Apple’s services business alone could be worth $1.5 trillion, Ives has estimated. He and other pundits have called the coming investment boom in tech the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.”
That sounds grandiose. And yet it’s hard to see what stands in Big Tech’s way. Lawmakers and regulators have expressed alarm over tech behemoths’ market power, but with the midterm election looming and Republicans and Democrats still at odds over what exactly to do to curb tech giants’ power, the window for new antimonopoly policy might be shrinking.

Stocks slid on Thursday, extending a volatile stretch of trading brought on by uncertainty about inflation, rising interest rates and the potential for war in Europe.
The S&P 500 fell 2.1 percent, dropping into negative territory for the week, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.9 percent.
Tech companies were some of the worst performers, with Meta, Facebook’s parent, down more than 4 percent. Alphabet, Google’s parent, fell 3.8 percent, and Microsoft was down 2.9 percent.
Tesla, one of the largest companies in the S&P 500, dropped 5.1 percent. The main auto-safety regulator in the United States said it was investigating reports from Tesla’s customers of “phantom braking” when they were using their vehicles’ driver-assistance system.

Shares of banks also fell, with Morgan Stanley dropping 5 percent and Wells Fargo losing 3.4 percent.
The prospect that President Vladimir V. Putin will order a Russian invasion of Ukraine has weighed on global markets. On Tuesday, the stock market rose after Russian officials announced a partial troop withdrawal from the Ukrainian border. But President Biden said on Thursday that the possibility of an invasion remained “very high,” and shelling between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists spiked, raising concerns that the conflict was heating up.
“Markets are concerned about the Russian troop buildup and a lack of trust in Putin’s declaration that they are beginning to remove troops from the region,” said Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, an investment advisory firm.

Investors have also been anticipating that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates as it looks to fight persistently high inflation. Raising the Fed’s policy rate can lead to higher interest rates for houses and cars, causing spending to slow and inflation to moderate. But it also can increase the return on bonds, making riskier investments like stocks less appealing.
Minutes released on Wednesday from the Fed’s January meeting showed that most officials agreed that they might need to withdraw their support for the economy even more quickly if inflation does not cool down as they expect. Investors are now anticipating that the Fed’s policy rate could rise to more than 1.75 percent by the end of the year, up from nearly zero.

Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which last week crossed 2 percent for the first time since 2019, fell about eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage points, to about 1.96 percent. Yields fall as prices for bonds rise, which happens when investors buy them as they move money out of riskier investments like stocks.
But the broad nature of Thursday’s sell-off pointed to more than one trigger. Oil has been trading at prices not seen since 2014, and an invasion by Russia, a big oil producer and Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas, would almost certainly push energy prices higher. But on Thursday, oil fell, with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, down 2 percent, to $91.76 a barrel. Natural gas fell more than 4 percent.
“The concerns for growth going forward and recession risks are new to traders’ minds,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA. “There’s a lot of fear that the optimistic growth outlook for 2023 is up in the air.”
Markets have been volatile for months, with concerns about the Omicron variant’s impact on the economy in November and December bleeding into uncertainty in January and February about persistently high inflation and how the Fed will react to it. Thursday’s drop was the S&P 500’s worst day in only two weeks, and if the index ends this week in the red it will be its fifth weekly drop just seven weeks into the year. The index is down 8.7 percent since its Jan. 3 high. The Nasdaq composite peaked on Nov. 19, just before the Omicron variant was disclosed, and is down 14.6 percent since then.
The consumer staples sector was one of the few that did not fall on Thursday. Walmart was one of the best-performing companies in the S&P 500, climbing 4 percent after it reported that its revenue rose to $152.9 billion, up 0.5 percent in the three months ending in January from a year earlier. The company also said that sales across its U.S. business increased 5.7 percent to about $105 billion in the quarter.

2022-02-18,"On the night of the Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2017, James Pearse Connelly was nominated for outstanding production design for his work on two shows: “Bill Nye Saves the World” and “The Voice.” He did not win for either. But Walter Wachter likes to say that Mr. Connelly ultimately won something better.
It was at the award ceremony, held at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, where Mr. Connelly first met Mr. Wachter, a production manager of original series at Netflix. The two had a brief exchange after being introduced by Jonathan Mussman, Mr. Wachter’s boss at Netflix, whom Mr. Connelly also knew.
Though their conversation was short, Mr. Wachter, dressed to stand out in white patent leather Oxford shoes and a matching white bow tie, made a lasting impression on Mr. Connelly, who had brought his mother as his date that evening.
A few days later, Mr. Connelly sent a Facebook message to Mr. Mussman asking him about, as Mr. Connelly recalled, “the cute guy with the white bow tie and white shoes.” Mr. Mussman happened to be in a meeting with Mr. Wachter when the message came through, and he showed it to him.
Mr. Wachter then followed Mr. Connelly on Instagram. Mr. Connelly responded by sending Mr. Wachter a direct message on the app. A week and a half later, they had their first date: sushi and sake in West Hollywood, Calif. They became so enmeshed in conversation, it took the server several attempts to get their order.

Shortly before traveling to Banff, the two realized there were stipulations for a legal wedding in Canada that they hadn’t considered, so they solemnized their marriage a month later in Los Angeles.

“We went deep on our first date, with our hearts and minds wide open,” said Mr. Connelly.
Both men grew up in New Jersey — Mr. Connelly, 41, is from Leonardo, and Mr. Wachter, 32, from Mount Laurel — and moved to Los Angeles to work in television.
Mr. Connelly, who graduated from Rutgers University, is the older of two children of Brian Connelly, an architect, and Mary Ellen Connelly, an art teacher, who are divorced. A production designer, he won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2009 for his work on the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards and, in 2011, started his own production design company, JP Connelly, in Los Angeles.
In 2020, Mr. Connelly won a Daytime Emmy Award for his work on “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” He has also appeared on the HBO Max reality competition show “Craftopia,” serving as a guest judge in its first season and a resident judge in its second.

Mr. Wachter, who goes by Wallie, graduated from Boston University and, before joining Netflix in 2016, worked as the executive assistant to the vice president of production at HBO. He is the youngest of four sons of Walter Wachter, a civil engineer, and Catherine Wachter, a homemaker who died in April 2017.
At the time of their first date, Mr. Wachter was still reeling from the loss of his mother months earlier. Mr. Connelly had recently come out of a difficult five-year relationship. Both men had dated enough in Hollywood to feel the perception that someone was interested in him because of where he worked or who he knew.
That evening, when Mr. Connelly described his mother’s belief that love is all about giving, without the expectation of something in return, it resonated for Mr. Wachter.
“I immediately knew I wanted to invest my time and energy into this,” said Mr. Wachter.
From then, other early milestones in their relationship included a date at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, where they debated whether to post their first selfie together (they did), and the day Mr. Wachter met Mr. Connelly’s French bulldog, Eleanor.
“We definitely had a certain communication magic between us, whether we were talking or texting,” said Mr. Connelly.
Soon, Mr. Wachter began staying over at Mr. Connelly’s place more and more. By November 2017, without any real discussion, he had moved in. While both wanted children, they had differing opinions about marriage.

Mr. Connelly came of age at a time when same-sex marriage was not yet legal, and he hadn’t made it a priority. By the time Mr. Wachter came out in 2008, he said, same-sex marriage seemed more of a possibility — Massachusetts had legalized it years earlier and Connecticut did that year — and he wanted children within the framework of marriage.
Eventually, Mr. Connelly came to understand Mr. Wachter’s viewpoint and, in the coming years, they would begin looking for an egg donor and a surrogate for a baby, a process that remains ongoing.
As for an engagement, Mr. Wachter said that while Mr. Connelly “was warming up to the idea of marriage, he wasn’t going to be the one to propose. He needed a push from me.”

Ahead of a trip to Japan that the couple took at the end 2019, Mr. Wachter went shopping for a ring. On their third day there, as the couple was waiting for a boat to collect them from their hotel on the Katsura River in Kyoto, Mr. Wachter dropped to one knee, surprising Mr. Connelly, who was preoccupied with creating Instagram stories.
Being proposed to was “an amazing gift,” Mr. Connelly said. “I was blown away and super surprised at how emotional it was.”

Afterward, he wanted to propose to Mr. Wachter in return. But the pandemic, which set in soon after they returned from Japan, delayed Mr. Connelly’s plan.
In July 2020, the men drove to Northern California for a getaway to Jenner, a small town on the Sonoma Coast. By then, they had acquired another French bulldog, Rigby, who along with Eleanor, joined them for the trip. (They got yet another, Honey Pie, after Eleanor died the following year.)
While Mr. Wachter suspected a proposal was coming, he did not expect it to happen on a hike overlooking the ocean at sunset.
“They are so in sync that they can have this whole conversation through their eyes,” said Lydia Smyth Garland, a friend of both men. “They are the couple at the restaurant that people watch from afar and think, ‘Now that’s how it should be.’”
The couple had a tradition of taking an annual trip somewhere new to both of them; for their wedding, they decided to open up that tradition to include their friends and family, and chose a location of Banff, Alberta.
Although they began planning during the pandemic, they optimistically chose Jan. 2, 2021, as their wedding date. But in the coming months, it became clear that Covid would make it too difficult for that to happen.

They postponed the event by nearly a year, to Dec. 19, 2021, at the Fairmont Banff Springs. The day before Mr. Connelly and Mr. Wachter were to fly to Canada, they were hearing rumors that the country might shut its borders because of the Omicron variant. Luckily, they remained only rumors.
While the couple was prepared for the extra steps required to travel internationally during the pandemic, they didn’t think about the local stipulations for having a legal wedding in Canada until days before the event, when Ms. Garland, whom they had asked to officiate, mentioned it.

“We were so busy thinking about rugs and the color of the couches, that we never thought about the legal portion,” Mr. Connelly said. They moved forward with their celebration and made plans to legally marry in Los Angeles upon their return.
Of the 120 people they invited to Banff, because of the Omicron variant, only 65 vaccinated guests made it to the event. To the morning ceremony led by Ms. Garland, the couple wore white jackets, white shoes and no ties; for the evening reception, they changed into tuxedos with midnight-blue jackets, made to measure by Zegna.
The self-imposed pressure on Mr. Connelly to create an unforgettable backdrop for their celebration in Canada was immense, he said.

On Jan. 22., they legalized their union at the Albertson Wedding Chapel in Los Angeles, with Ms. Garland, ordained by the Universal Life Church for the occasion, officiating.
Before Ms. Garland, the couple read their own vows.
“I give of my brain to envision with you what this life, our life, could be and how we change ‘could’ to ‘is,’” said Mr. Wachter.

2022-02-22,"TEMPE, Ariz. — Early in the pandemic, when shops along Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe closed their doors and students at nearby Arizona State University were asked to go home, the roar of construction continued to fill the air. Now, gleaming in the sunlight and stuffed with amenities, towering glass office buildings have sprouted up all over the Phoenix metropolitan area.
Arizonans are about to have new next-door neighbors. And they include some of the technology industry’s biggest names.
DoorDash, the food delivery company, moved into a new building on the edge of a Tempe reservoir in the summer of 2020. Robinhood, the financial trading platform, rented out a floor in an office nearby. On a February morning, construction workers were putting the finishing touches on a 17-story Tempe office building expected to add 550 Amazon workers to the 5,000 already in the area.
The frenetic activity in the Phoenix suburbs is one of the most visible signs of a nationwide recovery in commercial office real estate fueled by the tech industry, which has enjoyed unchecked growth and soaring profits as the pandemic has forced more people to shop, work and socialize online.

Big tech companies like Meta and Google were among the first to allow some employees to work from home permanently, but they have simultaneously been spending billions of dollars expanding their office spaces. Doubling down on offices may seem counterintuitive to the many tech workers who continue to work remotely. In January, 48 percent of people in computer and math fields and 35 percent of those in architecture or engineering said they had worked from home at some point because of the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But companies, real estate analysts and workplace experts said several factors were propelling the trend, including a hiring boom, a race to attract and retain top talent and a sense that offices will play a key role in the future of work. In the last three quarters of 2021, the tech industry leased 76 percent more office space than it did a year earlier, according to the real estate company CBRE.

“I think there are a lot more companies that are saying, ‘You’re coming back to work’ — it’s not ‘if,’ it’s ‘when,’” said Victor Coleman, the chief executive of Hudson Pacific Properties, a real estate investment group. “The reality is that most companies are currently working from home but are wanting and planning to come back to the office.”
Debates over whether workers should be required to return to the office can be thorny because some employees say they have been happier and more productive at home. One way companies are trying to lure them back is by splurging on prime office space with great amenities.

Big Tech executives say that office expansions are to be expected and that modernized buildings will probably be spaces for people to collaborate rather than stare at screens. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, leased 730,000 square feet in Midtown Manhattan in August 2020, and has added space in Silicon Valley as well as in Austin, Texas; Boston; Chicago; and Bellevue, Wash.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
“We will continue to grow and expect many people to return to our offices around the world once it’s safe,” said Tracy Clayton, a Meta spokesman.
Big Tech executives anticipate more office expansions, another sign that companies are shifting their expectations for employees.

Google said early last year that it would spend $7 billion on new and expanded offices and data centers around the country in 2021, including $2.1 billion to buy a Manhattan office building by the Hudson River, and growth in Atlanta; Silicon Valley; Boulder, Colo.; Durham, N.C.; and Pittsburgh. Google also said in January that it would spend $1 billion on a London office building.
Offices “remain an important part of supporting our hybrid approach to work in the future,” Google said in a statement.

During the pandemic, Microsoft has expanded in Houston; Miami; Atlanta; New York; Arlington, Va.; and Hillsboro, Ore. The company was growing to accommodate the many new employees it has hired over the last two years, said Jared Spataro, the vice president of modern work for Microsoft.
“The pandemic, I think, has just changed people’s perception of what’s possible in terms of geographic distribution,” Mr. Spataro said.
In April, Apple said it would build a campus near Raleigh, N.C., and has added space in San Diego and Silicon Valley. The company, which has battled with its employees over its plan for a majority of workers to return to offices most days each week, referred to its April news release about expansion but declined to comment further.
Salesforce, whose signature tower looms over the San Francisco skyline, is moving forward with four new office towers planned before the pandemic, in Tokyo, Dublin, Chicago and Sydney, Australia. The company said last February that many employees could be fully remote, but shifted its messaging months later, saying that “something is missing” without office life and urging workers to come back in.

Salesforce’s thinking about the office has evolved, said Steve Brashear, the company’s senior vice president in charge of real estate. At the start of the pandemic, the feeling was that “being remote sounds so great and so safe,” Mr. Brashear said. Now, “the idea of being isolated as a remote worker has its drawbacks.”

The industry’s search for land has been so extensive that it has surged through longtime tech hubs like Silicon Valley and into areas not traditionally known for their tech scenes.
In Phoenix, for instance, tech leasing activity grew more than 300 percent from mid-2020 to mid-2021. New leases, subleases and renewals in the area totaled more than one million square feet from April through September last year, up from about 260,000 square feet a year earlier, according to CBRE.
Other locations not normally associated with tech also saw growth. In Vancouver, British Columbia, tech leasing activity doubled in growth in mid-2021, to 561,000 square feet from 268,000, as did activity in Charlotte, N.C., to 143,000 square feet from 71,000.
Amazon has been one of the most prolific in expansion, announcing in 2020 that it would increase its white-collar work force in half a dozen cities. In Phoenix, its logo is ubiquitous, and it will occupy five floors in the new Tempe office building expected to be finished this year.

Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s vice president of economic development, said adding to its regional hubs allowed the company “to tap into wider and more diverse talent pools, provide increased flexibility for current and future employees, and create more jobs and economic opportunity across the country.”
For developers, the focus on offices is good for business, and some interpret the growth as an indictment of the fully remote model.
The thinking on remote work is “like a pendulum — it swung a little bit too far, and now it’s come back a little bit,” said George Forristall, the Phoenix real estate director at Mortenson Development.

The flurry of expansions also highlights how much better tech has fared than other industries during the pandemic. In some cities, remote work and high vacancy rates continue to hurt restaurants and retailers.

Office vacancy rates in San Francisco climbed to 22.4 percent at the end of 2021 from 21.5 percent in the third quarter of the year, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate firm. The city’s economists called tourism and office vacancies “special areas of concern in the city’s economic outlook.” In New York, office vacancy rates declined to 14.6 percent, according to JLL, but areas dependent on office workers to power local businesses, like Midtown Manhattan, are recovering more slowly.
Smaller tech companies, given their financial constraints, might have to choose whether to invest in physical spaces or embrace a more flexible strategy. Twitter has continued to add offices in Silicon Valley, and video game developers like Electronic Arts and Epic Games have expanded in places like Canada and North Carolina. But others have cut back.
Zynga, a gaming company, offered up its 185,000-square-foot San Francisco headquarters for sublease last summer because it decided that shrinking its physical office and moving would make life easier for employees, said Ken Stuart, vice president of real estate at Zynga. Its new building in San Mateo, Calif., will be less than half the size.
“The reality is that people are frustrated by the commute and getting into the city, and also people feel like they can do better work by being hybrid,” Mr. Stuart said.
By contrast, the largest tech giants “have so much money that it doesn’t matter,” said Anne Helen Petersen, a co-author of “Out of Office,” a recent book about the remote-work era. Because of their huge budgets, Ms. Petersen suggested, such companies can continue constructing offices without worrying about how much money they stand to lose if the buildings become obsolete.

“They’re hedging their bets,” Ms. Petersen said. “If the future’s going to be fully distributed, ‘we’ll be setting up an apparatus for that.’ If the future’s going to rubber-band back to everyone back to the office, the way it was in 2020, ‘we’ll go back to that.’”
In Tempe, the two-floor WeWork co-working space at the Watermark, one of the premier office spaces, was buzzing with activity on a recent afternoon. Upstairs, Amazon has rented an entire floor.
Below, amid leafy plants and colorful lighting, employees at tech start-ups clacked away on MacBooks and sketched on whiteboards. Many said it had become more crowded in recent months, and more companies were renting the small office spaces within the WeWork.

2022-02-25,"WASHINGTON — More than 75 years ago, faced with a Soviet Union that clearly wanted to take over states beyond its borders, the United States adopted a Cold War approach that came to be known as “containment,” a simplistic-sounding term that evolved into a complex Cold War strategy.
On Thursday, having awakened to a violent, unprovoked attack on Ukraine, exactly the kind of nightmare imagined eight decades before, President Biden made clear he was moving toward Containment 2.0. Though it sounds a lot like its predecessor, it will have to be revised for a modern era that is in many ways more complex.
The nation that just moved “to wipe an entire country off the world map,” in the words of Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, also remains a key supplier of natural gas to keep Germans and many other Europeans warm. That explains why Mr. Biden has been constrained from cutting off the valuable export. And the Russia of today has a panoply of cyberweapons that it can use to strike at the United States or its allies without risking nuclear Armageddon — an option to retaliate against American sanctions that was never available to President Vladimir V. Putin’s predecessors.
Those are only two examples of why containment will not be easy. But Mr. Biden has been clear that is where he is headed.

For three decades, American presidents described a series of Soviet and Russian leaders as “businesslike” or even “partners.” They celebrated “glasnost” and ushered Moscow into the World Trade Organization and the Group of 7 industrial nations. Washington even entertained the idea in the 1990s — very briefly — that one day Russia could join NATO. No one has talked that way in years. But Mr. Biden, who came to office last year talking about establishing a “stable, predictable” relationship with Moscow, spoke of a completely ruptured relationship on Thursday.
“Now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin allies are really all about,” Mr. Biden said in a speech from the White House. “This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary, by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption.”
He vowed to make Russia pay “dearly, economically and strategically,” and to make Mr. Putin a “pariah on the international stage.” Those words might have even been familiar to George F. Kennan, the American foreign service officer who became famous as the grand strategist who invented containment, though he later warned, at age 94, that expanding NATO to Russia’s borders was a bad idea, bound to become “the beginning of a new Cold War.”
The “containment” Mr. Kennan described in his famous “Long Telegram,” an 8,000-word dispatch from the American embassy in Moscow, was primarily aimed at putting geographical limits on Soviet ambitions. But even though the Long Telegram was long, it spent the most time explaining the psychology of Stalin’s regime, which Mr. Kennan described as paranoid, viewing the outside world to be “evil, hostile and menacing.”

The similarities to Mr. Putin’s speech on Monday night, in which he accused Ukraine of triggering genocides and seeking nuclear weapons — both false claims — and the United States of seeking to use Ukrainian territory to strike at Moscow, are striking. So was his description of America’s “empire of lies.”

But as Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Thursday, “It’s much more complicated to make containment work today.”
The Soviet Union largely presented a military and ideological challenge, he noted. Yet modern-day Russia is a provider of needed fuel and minerals, “and that gives them leverage over us, even as we have leverage over them.” The force of that leverage was made clear from Mr. Biden’s answer to a question on Thursday about why Russia had not been thrown out of SWIFT, the global communication system for financial transactions.
Barring Russia from that system would be a devastating move, cutting off its government from oil and gas revenue. That accounts for about 40 percent of its incoming cash and would be the one sanction almost certain to hurt Mr. Putin like no other.
But Mr. Biden noted in his speech that “in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.” When asked about barring Russia from SWIFT, he added, delicately, “Right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.” In fact, the debate over SWIFT has been a source of tense behind-the-scenes exchanges, chiefly with Germany. The German objection is clear: If the country cannot pay for its gas, Russia will not deliver it.

But the second reason containment may not work is that Russia has a new, if not very enthusiastic, partner in standing up to the West: China.
When Mr. Kennan described containment theory, China was in civil war. Later in the Cold War, when Russian leaders met their Chinese counterparts, Russia was the dominant player of the two countries. No longer. Last weekend, when China’s foreign minister told participants at the Munich Security Conference that Ukraine’s borders needed to be respected, people sat up in their seats.
It sounded, for a moment, as if China was reining Russia in. But that was Saturday. On Thursday, as Russian forces shelled Ukraine, the Chinese government said that it had approved several deals announced during Mr. Putin’s trip to Beijing for the Winter Olympics this month, including one to buy vast amounts of Russian wheat. The word “sanctions” never appeared in the Chinese announcement about the deals this week.
When Mr. Biden was asked on Thursday whether he was urging China to help isolate Russia, he hesitated and then said, “I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.”

Containment has another challenge that Mr. Kennan could not have envisioned: the rise of cyberconflict as a short-of-war mechanism for superpowers to attack each other from afar, without resorting to nuclear weapons.
Microsoft reported in October that 58 percent of the state-sponsored cyberattacks it had tracked around the world in the past year had emanated from Russia. And that does not count the criminal ransomware gangs that work from Russian territory.
Biden administration officials make no secret of their concern that Russia views its arsenal of disruptive cyberweapons as a way to strike back at American sanctions. Now that Mr. Biden has announced sanctions against some of Russia’s biggest banks, a well-planned cyberattack might be the most efficient way for Russia to try to retaliate against American financial institutions. But as Russia learned last year, the target set of vulnerable American infrastructure is much larger.
Mr. Biden’s one meeting last year with Mr. Putin, in Geneva, was prompted by the Colonial Pipeline hack, which shut down nearly half of the flow of gasoline, jet fuel and diesel on the East Coast — and triggered gas lines at a time of plentiful supply. It was an event that shook the White House and taught the Kremlin some lessons about the vulnerability of American critical infrastructure.
Mr. Biden emerged from the meeting offering some professional respect for Mr. Putin as an adversary. For his part, Mr. Putin said, “There has been no hostility.” At one point, Mr. Biden asked the Russian leader how he would feel if Russia’s gas pipelines were attacked from afar — a comment that some interpreted as a threat to the Russian leader.

For a few months, ransomware gangs were in retreat, and not long ago the Russian police, based on information from the United States, arrested a group of what they described as criminal hackers. But now there is fear that the ransomware gangs could be unleashed, as could hacking groups like Sandworm, which has been linked to the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence unit. Sandworm is believed to be responsible for hacks of the Ukrainian power grid and multiple targets in the United States.
For more than a month, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, has been issuing a series of what she calls “Shields Up” tweets and making public appearances to encourage more resiliency in the nation’s privately-controlled computer networks.
Together with the British, the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, Ms. Easterly’s agency recently revealed the technical details for a new strain of malware it has seen. It turns out that it was derived from one of the most destructive attacks ever conducted, which was aimed at Ukraine in 2017.
For America’s largest banks and utilities, this was old news: They have studied Russian attacks on Ukraine and other nations for years. But for institutions that have invested far less in fending off attacks, resiliency takes time to build up, so no one thinks that last-minute warnings to lock down vulnerable systems, while helpful, are enough.
For years, the U.S. government has warned that Russia has inserted malicious code in American networks, including the power grid, that could be triggered at a later date. (The United States has done the same in Russia.) But so far, Russia has been hesitant to unleash that “sleeper code.” The U.S.-led sanctions may tempt Russian leaders to unleash it, some speculate.

Then there is the problem of what some call “digital fallout,” in which an attack aimed at Ukraine creates collateral damage.
It has happened before: The Russian-created “NotPetya” attack on Ukraine in 2017 ended up escaping Ukraine’s borders, crippling some operations for shipping firms like Maersk and FedEx.
“You could imagine very rapid escalation into what could be regarded as an attack on NATO,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has focused much of his energy on these kinds of scenarios. It is uncharted territory of a kind Mr. Kennan never had to consider."

2022-02-28,"WASHINGTON — Last Wednesday, a few hours before Russian tanks began rolling into Ukraine, alarms went off inside Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center, warning of a never-before-seen piece of “wiper” malware that appeared aimed at the country’s government ministries and financial institutions.
Within three hours, Microsoft threw itself into the middle of a ground war in Europe — from 5,500 miles away. The threat center, north of Seattle, had been on high alert, and it quickly picked apart the malware, named it “FoxBlade” and notified Ukraine’s top cyberdefense authority. Within three hours, Microsoft’s virus detection systems had been updated to block the code, which erases — “wipes” — data on computers in a network.
Then Tom Burt, the senior Microsoft executive who oversees the company’s effort to counter major cyberattacks, contacted Anne Neuberger, the White House’s deputy national security adviser for cyber- and emerging technologies. Ms. Neuberger asked if Microsoft would consider sharing details of the code with the Baltics, Poland and other European nations, out of fear that the malware would spread beyond Ukraine’s borders, crippling the military alliance or hitting West European banks.
Before midnight in Washington, Ms. Neuberger had made introductions — and Microsoft had begun playing the role that Ford Motor Company did in World War II, when the company converted automobile production lines to make Sherman tanks.
After years of discussions in Washington and in tech circles about the need for public-private partnerships to combat destructive cyberattacks, the war in Ukraine is stress-testing the system. The White House, armed with intelligence from the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, is overseeing classified briefings on Russia’s cyberoffensive plans. Even if American intelligence agencies picked up on the kind of crippling cyberattacks that someone — presumably Russian intelligence agencies or hackers — threw at Ukraine’s government, they do not have the infrastructure to move that fast to block them.
“We are a company and not a government or a country,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, noted in a blog post issued by the company on Monday, describing the threats it was seeing. But the role it is playing, he made clear, is not a neutral one. He wrote about “constant and close coordination” with the Ukrainian government, as well as federal officials, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.

Alexis Grant wants it to be OK for a start-up to be just OK.
In our imaginations and in pop culture, it can feel as though there are only two paths for young technology companies: spectacular success with Ferraris and Ferragamo for everyone, or titanic wipeouts. The start-ups that change the world or die trying are the ones that people write books and make movies about.
The Silicon Valley myth all but ignores the vast middle ground between the unbelievables and the unforgivables. Grant is trying to fill the void.
Last month, Grant launched They Got Acquired, a website and database to chronicle the founders of online start-ups who sell their businesses for between $100,000 and $50 million.

For most of us, that scale of a business sale would be glorious. When I was still relatively new to writing about tech companies, a start-up founder confused me by acting apologetic that he sold his previous company for “only” tens of millions of dollars. I quickly learned that in the era of TikTok and Theranos, $1 million — and today, even $1 billion — is as disappointing as a single potato chip in a bag.
Grant, a former journalist and start-up founder in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., said that when our culture glamorizes the businesses that become billion or trillion dollar companies and the founders who work nonstop, people who are slowly and steadily building more modest young companies can feel left out — particularly if they are parents like her."

The state of the economy
President Biden led his first State of the Union address yesterday with a promise to make Vladimir Putin pay for invading Ukraine and praise for the Ukrainian resistance. When he turned to domestic issues, a fair amount of his hour-long speech focused on business and the economy.
Biden said fighting inflation was his “top priority,” and made eye-catching proposals. The president said he would encourage competition and ease supply-chain snarls that have led to rising prices (more on that below). He promised to crack down on shipping companies that had taken advantage of the pandemic to raise prices. He said he would launch an investigation into fraud stemming from pandemic relief measures. And on drug prices, he appeared to embrace the contentious idea of price controls, for example with a call to “cap the cost” of insulin at $35 a month.
But talking down inflation isn’t easy. “Wonder if he connected convincingly on inflation? Felt like a driveby,” tweeted the Democratic strategist David Axelrod. And recent actions to stem the rise in oil prices, like releasing oil from strategic reserves, have had little effect, with prices jumping again today.
Biden extolled a resurgence of manufacturing, saying that the Rust Belt deserved a new name. Intel’s C.E.O., Pat Gelsinger, attended the speech and got a shout-out as the president cited the company’s $20 billion plan to build semiconductor factories in Ohio. Biden also praised Ford and G.M. for devoting a combined $18 billion toward making electric vehicles in the U.S. While the American manufacturing sector has added 400,000 workers in the past year, jobs in the sector, which accounts for around 8 percent of the work force, are still down from pre-pandemic levels.
Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said that Biden pandered to “macho manufacturing fetishes” and ignored the majority of workers outside heavy industry.

Biden’s speech highlighted some of his divisions with the business community. After the speech, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla — unmentioned in the address — had created 50,000 U.S. jobs and invested more in electric-vehicle tech than G.M. and Ford combined; the exchange underscored Biden’s focus on automakers with unionized workforces. The president also invited the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen to attend and thanked her in the speech, signaling that his administration will continue clamping down on tech giants."

2022-03-04,"The hackers came from around the world. They knocked Russian and Ukrainian government websites offline, graffitied antiwar messages onto the home pages of Russian media outlets and leaked data from rival hacking operations. And they swarmed into chat rooms, awaiting new instructions and egging each other on.
The war in Ukraine has provoked an onslaught of cyberattacks by apparent volunteers unlike any that security researchers have seen in previous conflicts, creating widespread disruption, confusion and chaos that researchers fear could provoke more serious attacks by nation-state hackers, escalate the war on the ground or harm civilians.
“It is crazy, it is bonkers, it is unprecedented,” said Matt Olney, the director of threat intelligence at the security firm Cisco Talos. “This is not going to be solely a conflict among nations. There are going to be participants that are not under the strict control of any government.”
The online battles have blurred the lines between state-backed hackers and patriotic amateurs, making it difficult for governments to understand who is attacking them and how to retaliate. But both Ukraine and Russia appear to have embraced tech-savvy volunteers, creating channels on the chat app Telegram to direct them to target specific websites.

Hackers have inserted themselves in international conflicts before in places like Syria. But experts said that those efforts have attracted fewer participants. The hundreds of hackers now racing to support their respective governments represent a drastic and unpredictable expansion of cyberwarfare.
The involvement of the volunteer hackers makes it more difficult to determine who is responsible for an online attack. Some of the hackers said they were Ukrainians living inside and outside the country. Some said they were citizens of other countries who were simply interested in the conflict. It was impossible in some circumstances to verify their identities.
Their attacks stand apart from the sophisticated incursions made by nation-state hackers in recent years. While hackers affiliated with the Russian government have quietly infiltrated American government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, these participants have loudly proclaimed their allegiances and used simpler methods to topple or deface websites.
And while their tactics appear to have been successful in some instances, security researchers cautioned it was unrealistic to believe cyberattacks by volunteer hackers without specialized technical expertise would play a determinative role in the military campaign on the ground.
“The land invasion is advancing, people are suffering, buildings are being destroyed,” said Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and a former cyberwarfare adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. “Cyberattacks can’t realistically impact this.”

Ukraine has been more deliberate about recruiting a volunteer hacking force. In Telegram channels, participants cheer their collaboration with the government in going after targets such as Sberbank, the Russian state-owned bank. From Russia, where links between the government and hacking groups have long raised alarms among Western officials, there has not been the same kind of overt calls to action.
“We are creating an I.T. army,” Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted on Saturday, directing cybersecurity enthusiasts to a Telegram channel that contained instructions for knocking Russian websites offline. “There will be tasks for everyone.” By Friday, the Telegram channel had more than 285,000 subscribers.
Inside the main English-language Telegram page for the I.T. Army of Ukraine is a 14-page introductory document providing details about how people can participate, including what software to download to mask their whereabouts and identity. Every day, new targets are listed, including websites, telecommunications firms, banks and A.T.M. processors.
Yegor Aushev, the co-founder of the Ukrainian cybersecurity company Cyber Unit Technologies, said he was flooded with notes after posting on social media a call for programmers to get involved. His company offered a $100,000 reward for those who identify flaws in the code of Russian cyber targets.
Mr. Aushev said there were more than 1,000 people involved in his effort, working in close collaboration with the government. People were only allowed to join if somebody vouched for them. Organized into small groups, they were aiming to hit high-impact targets like infrastructure and logistics systems important to the Russian military.

“It’s become an independent machine, a distributed international digital army,” Mr. Aushev said. “The biggest hacks against Russia will be soon,” he added, without elaborating.
A government spokesman confirmed the work with Mr. Aushev.
Figuring out who is behind a cyberattack is always difficult. Groups falsely take credit or boast of a bigger impact than actually occurred. But this week there were a string of attacks against Russian targets. The country’s largest stock exchange, a state-controlled bank and the Russian Foreign Ministry were taken offline for a time after being targeted by Ukraine’s volunteer hackers.
On Monday, TripAdvisor and Google Maps halted reviews at some locations in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus after pro-Ukraine volunteers targeted the sites to share uncensored information with the Russian public about the war.
On Wednesday, the website of the main Russian intelligence service, the F.S.B., was declared a target by the group. A few hours later, a picture was posted to the I.T. Army Telegram channel showing it had been taken down, a claim that could not be independently verified.
“They could not overcome your attacks,” the group said on Telegram, a message that was reposted by Mr. Fedorov.

The worst fears of military analysts and cybersecurity experts — that Russia would use devastating cyberattacks to take down critical Ukrainian infrastructure like energy, government services and internet access — have not yet occurred.
Yet the involvement of nongovernment groups could escalate quickly and cause unintended consequences, experts warned. A malware attack against one target could quickly spill over and become uncontrollable, as it did during a 2017 attack on Ukrainian government and business computer systems. Or a government might mistake an amateur attack for a state-backed one and decide to retaliate.
“In this quickly escalating situation they are taking steps on behalf of the government that can have very serious repercussions on civilians. This is the big risk,” said Klara Jordan, chief public policy officer at CyberPeace Institute in Geneva.

Alex Holden, who founded the cybersecurity firm Hold Security and who has studied Russian ransomware groups, said attacks by volunteers on the Russian government were likely to draw a stiff response.

“Those that support the Russian government and their invasion in Ukraine are preparing their retaliation against a number of different targets,” Mr. Holden said.
In a Telegram channel called Russian Cyber Front, pro-Russia hackers were instructed to target a Ukrainian government website through which citizens can access digital copies of their drivers’ licenses, passports and other documentation. “Attack those who threaten our I.T. infrastructure and dare to attack our resources,” the channel instructed. It was not clear whether their efforts succeeded.
Over the past two weeks, there have been a number of cyberattacks of Ukrainian targets without clear attribution of who was behind the assaults, according to CyberPeace Institute, which has been tracking cybersecurity events in the war.
Malware linked to Russia targeted Ukrainian government computer systems in the days before the invasion, Microsoft said this week, and Ukrainian officials said Russia was likely behind another attack that took down some mobile services. There have been unattributed attacks against an English-language news outlet, the Kyiv Post, and a border control station where people were fleeing into Romania, according to CyberPeace Institute.
Last week, a ransomware group known as Conti declared its support for Russia. “If anybody will decide to organize a cyberattack or any war activities against Russia, we are going to use our all possible resources to strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy,” the group, which is known for capturing corporate data and charging companies to return it, said in a blog post.

But days later, internal files from Conti began to leak online — the apparent result of a hacking operation. The files exposed discussions among members of the group and some of the digital wallets they used to hold cryptocurrency.
In neighboring Belarus, a hacktivist group called Belarusian Cyber Partisans said it had targeted train services in Belarus that were carrying Russian military supplies toward Ukraine, though there was not independent verification of whether the work was successful.
Cyber Partisans, formed in 2020 to oppose the authoritarian government of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, has become a model for hacktivists for leaking troves of information from government and police databases.
After Russia began using Belarus as a staging area for the invasion, the group began working with Ukrainian activists, lending technical support and helping recruit new volunteers.
“This is war and you fight back,” said Yuliana Shemetovets, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for the Cyber Partisans."

2022-03-06,"On a snowy tarmac at Amari Air Base in northern Estonia on Sunday morning, pallets of rifles, ammunition and other weapons were being loaded onto one of the largest cargo planes in the world, an Antonov AN-124, belonging to the Ukrainian air force. It is an artifact of the Cold War, built and purchased when Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union.
Now it is being turned back against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, part of a vast airlift that American and European officials describe as a desperate race against time, to get tons of arms into the hands of Ukrainian forces while their supply routes are still open. Scenes like this, reminiscent of the Berlin airlift — the famed race by the Western allies to keep West Berlin supplied with essentials in 1948 and 1949 as the Soviet Union sought to choke it off — are playing out across Europe.
In less than a week, the United States and NATO have pushed more than 17,000 antitank weapons, including Javelin missiles, over the borders of Poland and Romania, unloading them from giant military cargo planes so they can make the trip by land to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and other major cities. So far, Russian forces have been so preoccupied in other parts of the country that they have not targeted the arms supply lines, but few think that can last.
But those are only the most visible contributions. Hidden away on bases around Eastern Europe, forces from United States Cyber Command known as “cybermission teams” are in place to interfere with Russia’s digital attacks and communications — but measuring their success rate is difficult, officials say.

In Washington and Germany, intelligence officials race to merge satellite photographs with electronic intercepts of Russian military units, strip them of hints of how they were gathered, and beam them to Ukrainian military units within an hour or two. As he tries to stay out of the hands of Russian forces in Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine travels with encrypted communications equipment, provided by the Americans, that can put him into a secure call with President Biden. Mr. Zelensky used it Saturday night for a 35-minute call with his American counterpart on what more the U.S. can do in its effort to keep Ukraine alive without entering into direct combat on the ground, in the air or in cyberspace with Russian forces.
Mr. Zelensky welcomed the help so far, but repeated the criticism that he has made in public — that the aid was wildly insufficient to the task ahead. He asked for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a shutdown of all Russian energy exports and a fresh supply of fighter jets.
It is a delicate balance. On Saturday, while Mr. Biden was in Wilmington, Del., his National Security Council staff spent much of the day trying to find a way for Poland to transfer to Ukraine a fleet of well-used, Soviet-made MIG-29 fighter jets that Ukrainian pilots know how to fly. But the deal is contingent on giving Poland, in return, far more capable, American-made F-16s, an operation made more complicated by the fact that many of those fighters are promised to Taiwan — where the United States has greater strategic interests.
Polish leaders have said there is no deal, and are clearly concerned about how they would provide the fighters to Ukraine and whether doing so would make them a new target of the Russians. The United States says it is open to the idea of the plane swap.
“I can’t speak to a timeline, but I can just tell you that we’re looking at it very, very actively,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Sunday, during a trip that has taken him to Moldova, another non-NATO country that American officials fear may be next on Russian President Vladimir V. Putin’s hit list of nations to bring back into Moscow’s sphere of influence.

And in downtown Washington, lobbying groups and law firms that once charged the Ukrainian government handsomely for their services are now working for free, helping Mr. Zelensky’s embattled government plead for more sanctions on Russia.
The Ukrainians are also asking for more money for weapons, though they reject the idea that Washington is manipulating Mr. Zelensky’s image to present him as Churchill in a T-shirt, rallying his country to war. Covington & Burling, a major law firm, filed a motion pro bono on behalf of Ukraine in the International Court of Justice.
It is, in many ways, a more complex effort than the Berlin airlift three-quarters of a century ago. West Berlin was a small territory with direct air access. Ukraine is a sprawling country of 44 million from which Mr. Biden has pulled all American forces in an effort to avoid becoming a “co-combatant” in the war, a legal term that governs how far the United States can go in helping Ukraine without being considered in direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia.
But as the weapons flow in and if efforts to interfere in Russian communications and computer networks escalate, some U.S. national security officials say they have a foreboding that such conflict is increasingly likely. The American legal definitions of what constitutes entering the war are not Mr. Putin’s definitions, one senior American national security official warned over the weekend, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the American overt and covert efforts to aid Ukraine.
Mr. Putin warned on Saturday that any nation that attempted to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be “participating in the armed conflict.” On Sunday the Russian ministry of defense issued a statement warning NATO countries like Romania against allowing their bases to be used as a safe haven for the remaining planes in the Ukrainian air force. If they do so, it said, any “subsequent use against the Russian armed forces can be regarded as the involvement of these states in an armed conflict.”

Two decades ago this month, as American forces began to flow into Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus famously asked, “Tell me how this ends.” In the case of Ukraine, a senior American official said, the question resonating around the White House is more like: “Tell me how we don’t get sucked in to a superpower conflict.”
A Flow of Arms Becomes a Torrent
To understand the warp-speed nature of the arms transfers underway now, consider this: A $60 million arms package to Ukraine that the U.S. announced last August was not completed until November, the Pentagon said.
But when the president approved $350 million in military aid on Feb. 26 — nearly six times larger — 70 percent of it was delivered in five days. The speed was considered essential, officials said, because the equipment — including anti-tank weapons — had to make it through western Ukraine before Russian air and ground forces started attacking the shipments. As Russia takes more territory inside the country, it is expected to become more and more difficult to distribute weapons to Ukrainian troops.
Within 48 hours of Mr. Biden approving the transfer of weapons from U.S. military stockpiles on Feb. 26, the first shipments, largely from Germany, were arriving at airfields near Ukraine’s border, officials said.
The military was able to push those shipments forward quickly by tapping into pre-positioned military stockpiles ready to roll onto Air Force C-17 transport planes and other cargo aircraft, and flying them to about half a dozen staging bases in neighboring countries, chiefly in Poland and Romania.

Still, the resupply effort faces stiff logistical and operational challenges.
“The window for doing easy stuff to help the Ukrainians has closed,” said Maj. Gen. Michael S. Repass, a former commander of U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe.
U.S. officials say Ukrainian leaders have told them that American and other allied weaponry is making a difference on the battlefield. Ukrainian soldiers armed with shoulder-fired Javelin anti-tank missiles have several times in the past week attacked a mileslong convoy of Russian armor and supply trucks, helping stall the Russian ground advance as it bears down on Kyiv, Pentagon officials said. Some of the vehicles are being abandoned, officials said, because Russian troops fear sitting in the convoy when fuel-supply tanks are being targeted by the Ukrainians, setting off fireballs.

The convoy has also come under attack several times at different places along the column from another weapon supplied by a NATO member state. Armed Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones, which the Ukrainian military used for the first time in combat against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine last October, are now hunting Russian tanks and other vehicles, U.S. officials said.
“All of us have been tremendously impressed by how effectively the Ukrainian armed forces have been using the equipment that we’ve provided them,” Laura Cooper, the Pentagon’s top Russia policy official, said. “Kremlin watchers have also been surprised by this, and how they have slowed the Russian advance and performed extremely well on the battlefield.”

Even the elements have sided with the Ukrainian military in the war’s early days. Bad weather in northern Ukraine has grounded some Russian attack planes and helicopters, a senior Pentagon official said. Many Russian vehicles that have driven off the main roads to avoid the stalled convoy have gotten stuck in the mud, making them more vulnerable to attack, officials said.
But the U.S. intelligence also has its limits. Mr. Biden’s ground rules forbid flying surveillance aircraft over Ukraine, so they have to peer in over the border, much as surveillance is often conducted over North Korea. There is reliance on new, small satellites — providing images similar to those that commercial firms like Maxar and Planet Labs are providing.
A War in Cyberspace That Has Barely Begun
One of the odd features of the conflict so far is that it runs the gamut of old and modern warfare. The trenches dug by Ukrainian soldiers in the south and east look like scenes from 1914. The Russian tanks rolling through the cities evoke Budapest in 1956. But the battle of the present day that most strategists expected to mark the opening days of the war — over computer networks and the power grids and communications systems they control — has barely begun.
American officials say that is partly because of extensive work done to harden Ukraine’s networks after Russian attacks on its electric grid in 2015 and 2016. But experts say that cannot explain it all. Perhaps the Russians did not try very hard at the outset, or are holding their assets in reserve. Perhaps an American-led counteroffensive — part of what Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, calls a doctrine of “persistent engagement” in global networks — explains at least some of the absence.
Government officials are understandably tight-lipped, saying the cyberoperations underway, which have been moved in recent days from an operations center in Kyiv to one outside the country, are some of the most classified elements of the conflict. But it is clear that the cybermission teams have tracked some familiar targets, including the activities of the G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence operations, to try to neutralize their activity. Microsoft has helped, turning out patches in hours to kill off malware it detects in unclassified systems.
All of this is new territory when it comes to the question of whether the United States is a “co-combatant.” By the American interpretation of the laws of cyberconflict, the United States can temporarily interrupt Russian capability without conducting an act of war; permanent disablement is more problematic. But as experts acknowledge, when a Russian system goes down, the Russian units don’t know whether it is temporary or permanent, or even whether the United States is responsible.
Similarly, sharing intelligence is perilous. American officials are convinced that Ukraine’s military and intelligence agencies are populated with Russian spies, so they are being careful not to distribute raw intelligence that would reveal sources. And they say they are not passing on specific intelligence that would tell Ukrainian forces how to go after specific targets. The concern is that doing so would give Russia an excuse to say it is fighting the United States or NATO, not Ukraine.

The Lobbyists Fight, Too
Ukraine has been receiving lobbying, public relations and legal assistance free of charge — and it is paying off. Mr. Zelensky held a Zoom call with members of Congress on Saturday, pushing for tougher sanctions on Russia and urging specific types of arms and other support.
An ad hoc team includes Andrew Mac, an American lawyer who has been volunteering as a lobbyist and nonstaff adviser to Mr. Zelensky since late 2019, and Daniel Vajdich, a lobbyist who had been paid by the Ukrainian energy industry and a civil society nonprofit group, but is now working for free. But American lobbyists are a sensitive topic in Ukraine, after Paul Manafort, later President Trump’s campaign chairman, worked for a pro-Russian president who was ousted in 2014, and after Mr. Trump tried to make military aid to Kyiv dependent on its willingness to help find dirt on then-candidate Biden and his son, Hunter.
Mr. Vajdich said he hoped his clients would redirect any funds they would have paid his firm to military defenses and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians forced from their homes by the fighting, drawing a comparison to early Nazi military aggression.

Any remnants of that are now gone.
As Mr. Putin has waged war on Ukraine, a digital barricade went up between Russia and the world. Both Russian authorities and multinational internet companies built the wall with breathtaking speed. And the moves have ruptured an open internet that was once seen as helping to integrate Russia into the global community.
TikTok and Netflix are suspending their services in the country. Facebook has been blocked. Twitter has been partly blocked, and YouTube’s future is in doubt. Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco and others have pulled back or withdrawn entirely from Russia. Even online video games like Minecraft are no longer available.
The actions have turned Russia into a walled-off digital state akin to China and Iran, which tightly control the internet and censor foreign websites and dissent. China’s internet and the Western internet have become almost completely separate over the years, with few overlapping services and little direct communication. In Iran, the authorities have used internet blackouts during protests.

International pariah
Each day brings more economic punishments for Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The sudden isolation of the Russian economy is striking in its speed and scope.
Yesterday, President Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian oil; Britain said it would phase out Russian oil imports by year end; and the E.U. pledged to shun Russian energy “well before 2030.” Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, said yesterday that it would stop buying Russian crude, after facing criticism for buying a tanker’s worth days earlier. Such unilateral corporate moves have compounded governments’ actions, cleaving Russia from the global economy, with uncertain and unpredictable consequences.
“Defending freedom is going to cost,” Biden said in announcing the import ban. Russia accounts for about 10 percent of the world’s oil supply, so any disruptions are likely to push up prices. Crude oil, which at around $125 a barrel is double its prepandemic level, could rise as high as $175, according to Goldman Sachs. The U.S. national average price of gasoline sits at $4.25 per gallon, a record. That is contributing to inflation and eating into consumers’ budgets, which could slow the U.S. economy (and hit countries that rely on Russian energy even harder).
The effect of the embargoes and sanctions are clearer for the Russian economy, which S&P estimates will shrink by nearly 9 percent this year. Fitch said Russia is at risk of “imminent” default after cutting the country’s credit rating deeper into junk territory. President Vladimir Putin has ordered restrictions on Russian exports of unspecified raw materials, which will further limit the country’s trade revenues.
Replacing Russian oil won’t be easy, as the U.S. and other buyers chase limited supplies. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait could add 2.5 million barrels, but all are all members of OPEC Plus, an alliance of oil-producing nations that includes Russia. Venezuela and Iran could contribute about 1.5 million barrels a day, but that would require lifting American sanctions. U.S. producers could also ramp up production, but it would take investment and time.

American brands quitting Russia has more than symbolic significance. After years of cultivating the Russian market, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and PepsiCo were among the companies yesterday that announced a pause to their operations there. Since Soviet times, these firms came to symbolize the opening of Moscow to the West. Starbucks also said it would close all of its locations and Yum Brands said some of its KFC and Pizza Hut locations would suspend operations.
Although these companies’ Russian operations account for single-digit percentages of group profits, their absence will be felt: McDonald’s, for example, employs 62,000 people in Russia. (The company said it would continue to pay salaries.) “It appears that much of the Russian populace knows little about the attack on Ukraine,” Louis Wells of Harvard Business School told DealBook. “If McDonald’s and Coca-Cola disappear along with Ikea and other foreign brands, people have to ask why.”
The pressure on companies to act is growing, from investors, employees and social media campaigns. The list of company actions compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management, updated daily, is a focus for a variety of stakeholders, and a major point of discussion in the boardrooms of companies highlighted because they have yet to disclose their Russia plans.

2022-03-11,"Far-right influencers have often encouraged people to use the small privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo instead of Google, saying that the giant search engine censored conservative ideas.
The praise for DuckDuckGo turned to outrage this week, though, after the company said Russian disinformation would be minimized on its site.
DuckDuckGo’s chief executive, Gabriel Weinberg, tweeted on Thursday that the search engine would rank websites “associated with disinformation” lower in its search results.
“Like so many others I am sickened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the gigantic humanitarian crisis it continues to create,” he wrote.

DuckDuckGo has little control over its search results because they are provided by Microsoft’s Bing, which announced that it would follow the European Union’s order to restrict access to the Russian state news agencies RT and Sputnik.
But the criticism from the far right was directed at DuckDuckGo. The conservative website Breitbart said DuckDuckGo was “adopting the censorship policies” of Big Tech. In social media channels devoted to conspiracy theories, users vowed to switch to alternatives like the Russian search engine Yandex. The hashtag #DuckDuckGone trended across Twitter in the United States by Friday. And on YouTube, users criticized the company for silencing voices.
“If you’re using DuckDuckGo, I suggest you stop using it and switch to something else,” said Tarl Warwick, a self-described libertarian YouTube user with nearly half a million followers. He added: “I want tens of thousands of people to stop using it.”
In a statement, Kamyl Bazbaz, the vice president of communications for DuckDuckGo, said that the affected sites were engaged in “active disinformation campaigns,” meaning they were similar to other low-quality websites already penalized by search algorithms.
“This isn’t censorship, it’s just search rankings,” he said.
The backlash underscored the difficulties some technology companies face in limiting the spread of Russian propaganda at a time when pockets of America express support for the Kremlin and believe Big Tech companies are censoring their views.

Last month, The New York Times reported that search results on DuckDuckGo and Bing surfaced more untrustworthy websites than the same searches using conspiracy theory terms entered in Google.
DuckDuckGo controls about 3 percent of the search engine market in the United States. The site is especially popular among privacy activists because the company doesn’t track its users, unlike Google and Bing.
The company also announced this month that it would pause its relationship with Yandex, the Russian search engine, which was providing certain links for results in Russia and Turkey."

As the war in Ukraine continues, the widening, noisy and at times confusing battle between Facebook’s parent, Meta, and Vladimir Putin’s government has generated its fair share of headlines. So a critique from one of Facebook’s earliest — and perhaps most important — investors may have slipped your notice. But it is a critical development.
That investor would be Yuri Milner, the most high-profile Russian-born investor in Silicon Valley, who after a few weeks of silence this week denounced the invasion of Ukraine in no uncertain terms. Given his background, that was a bold move, to say the least.
But before I get to his comments, a little more about Milner. He burst onto the scene in 2009 when his firm ponied up around $200 million for a stake in Facebook that was critical to its nascent global ambitions. Both Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, talked up Milner and his Digital Sky Technologies Global investment vehicle to me when they appeared at my All Things Digital conference. I made a point of getting to know more about him and his partners.
An investment in Twitter and other top companies followed and the affable Milner quickly became integral to the tech scene, including reportedly paying $100 million for a lavish Los Altos Hills, Calif., house called the Loire Chateau, and throwing what I am told were epic parties there. I never got an invite, but other Milner parties I’ve attended — like those for the Breakthrough Prize, which focused on giving a pile of money to top science and medical geeks — were certainly opulent. For that, he joined with big names like Zuckerberg and Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin, alongside celebrities like Zoe Saldana, Lenny Kravitz and James Corden, to dole out the dough to how-did-I-get-here recipients inside a dolled-up tent at NASA’s Ames Research Center. Always over the top, especially for the tech biz, the parties were also charmingly awkward.
Still, from the start, the reputation of Milner’s firm was tainted because a big slug of its financing came from the metal and telecommunications oligarch Alisher Usmanov (recently slapped with sanctions by Britain), who was close to Putin. Milner later further diversified his sources of capital, but someone always seemed to make a “Putin’s money” barb at any luxe gathering he threw.
A Times investigation in 2017 detailed how a series of shell companies backing Milner’s company, now known as DST Global, were linked to Russian sources. Milner complained that the article relied on “guilt by association” and noted that “investments can be made on business merits only — even by a Russian.”

2022-03-18,"A court on Friday threw out what was thought to have been the first government lawsuit in the United States arguing that Amazon had broken antitrust laws.
Judge Hiram E. Puig-Lugo of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia granted Amazon’s motion to dismiss the complaint, which was filed last year by Karl Racine, the district’s attorney general, according to court records. The records did not state the reason for the dismissal.
The lawsuit focused on how Amazon treats merchants that use its website to sell products. According to the lawsuit, Amazon made them sell their wares on its site at the lowest price they charged elsewhere on the web or at a lower price entirely. That caused merchants to raise prices across the board, the suit argued.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Racine’s office said that “the Superior Court got this wrong” and that the office was “considering our legal options.” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Regulators, lawmakers and law enforcement agencies have been trying to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. The federal government has sued Google over its power in the search industry and has sued Facebook over allegations it stamped out competition by buying start-ups that could have challenged its dominance.
But the tech giants have continued to grow. Microsoft said in January that it would buy the video game studio Activision Blizzard for almost $70 billion. And Amazon said on Thursday that it had completed its purchase of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio — which owns part of the James Bond franchise — after European regulators approved the deal."
2022-03-19,"WASHINGTON — In the first weeks of the first major European land war of the 21st century, the United States has sent tank-killing weapons to Ukrainian forces, but not fighter jets. It is equipping embattled Ukrainian troops with lightweight “kamikaze” attack drones, but not, at least in an obvious way, conducting an aggressive cyberwar to degrade Russia’s technological advantage.
The White House will commit no American or NATO planes to the skies above Ukraine, a move American officials fear could risk turning a regional war into a global conflagration, but it is providing Ukraine with missiles that could accomplish the same task of destroying Russian aircraft.
Such is the tenuous balance the Biden administration has tried to maintain as it seeks to help Ukraine lock Russia in a quagmire without inciting a broader conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary or cutting off potential paths to de-escalation.
Navigating this path has led to a tangle of decisions, and sometimes tortured distinctions, when it comes to what kinds of assistance Washington should provide, even as the situation on the ground evolves, pictures of dead civilians circulate around the globe and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine pleads with Congress and President Biden to do more to help.
The balancing act informs every aspect of American policy about the war, including the scope of the punishing sanctions imposed on the Russian economy, the granularity of the battlefield intelligence provided to Ukrainian troops, the killing power of the weapons systems coming over the border and whether, as Mr. Biden did this past week, to label President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a war criminal.
C.I.A. officers are helping to ensure that crates of weapons are delivered into the hands of vetted Ukrainian military units, according to American officials. But as of now, Mr. Biden and his staff do not see the utility of an expansive covert effort to use the spy agency to ferry in arms as the United States did in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union during the 1980s. They have judged that such a campaign would be an unnecessary provocation, in part because NATO supply lines remain open and there is a functioning government in Kyiv.

Apple and Amazon were already in towers just down the street, and Google was about to open a new building around the corner. Meta, formerly Facebook, did not yet have an office downtown, but many Toronto start-ups complained that the social media company was driving tech salaries to Silicon Valley levels as it recruited top engineers across the city. During the pandemic, it was hiring anyone willing to work from home.
A few blocks north, construction workers in yellow vests and hard hats were finishing three floors of new office space for another social media company: Pinterest. Stripe, an American payments company, was opening an office near City Hall, where Klarna, a Scandinavian payments company, had just announced its arrival with a flashy photo op alongside Mayor John Tory.

As the tech industry continues to expand and communities all over the world compete for tech jobs outside Silicon Valley, many executives, investors and entrepreneurs are promoting warm climes like Austin and Miami as the next big tech hubs. But they are tiny tech communities compared with the new hub growing in the cool air along the shore of Lake Ontario.
Thanks to years of investment from local universities, government agencies and business leaders and Canada’s liberal immigration policies, Toronto is now the third-largest tech hub in North America. It is home to more tech workers than Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington, D.C., trailing only New York and Silicon Valley, according to CBRE, a real estate company that tracks tech hiring.

2022-03-24,"GÖTTINGEN, Germany — The European Union agreed on Thursday to one of the world’s most far-reaching laws to address the power of the biggest tech companies, potentially reshaping app stores, online advertising, e-commerce, messaging services and other everyday digital tools.
The law, called the Digital Markets Act, is the most sweeping piece of digital policy since the bloc put the world’s toughest rules to protect people’s online data into effect in 2018. The legislation is aimed at stopping the largest tech platforms from using their interlocking services and considerable resources to box in users and squash emerging rivals, creating room for new entrants and fostering more competition.
What that means practically is that companies like Google will no longer be able to collect data from different services to offer targeted ads without users’ consent and that Apple may have to allow alternatives to its App Store on iPhones and iPads. Violators of the law, which will take effect as early as later this year, could face penalties of up to 20 percent of their global revenue — which could reach into the tens of billions of dollars — for repeat offenses.
The Digital Markets Act is part of a one-two punch by European regulators. As early as next month, the European Union is expected to reach an agreement on a law that would force social media companies such as Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to police their platforms more aggressively.

With these actions, Europe is cementing its leadership as the most assertive regulator of tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft. European standards are often adopted worldwide, and the latest legislation further raises the bar by potentially bringing the companies under a new era of oversight — just like health care, transportation and banking industries.
“Faced with big online platforms behaving like they were ‘too big to care,’ Europe has put its foot down,” said Thierry Breton, one of the top digital officials in the European Commission. “We are putting an end to the so-called Wild West dominating our information space. A new framework that can become a reference for democracies worldwide.”
On Thursday, representatives from the European Parliament and European Council hammered out the last specifics of the law in Brussels. The agreement followed about 16 months of talks — a speedy pace for the E.U. bureaucracy — and sets the stage for a final vote in Parliament and among representatives from the 27 countries in the union. That approval is viewed as a formality.
Europe’s moves contrast with the lack of activity in the United States. While Republicans and Democrats have held several high-profile congressional hearings to scrutinize Meta, Twitter and others in recent years, and U.S. regulators have filed antitrust cases against Google and Meta, no new federal laws have been passed to address what many see as the tech companies’ unchecked power.

Europe’s new rules could offer a preview of what’s to come elsewhere in the world. The region’s online privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, which restricts the online collection and sharing of personal data, has served as a model in countries from Japan to Brazil.

The path of the Digital Markets Act faced hurdles. Policymakers dealt with what watchdogs said was one of the fiercest lobbying efforts ever seen in Brussels as industry groups tried to water down the new law. They also brushed aside concerns raised by the Biden administration that the rules unfairly targeted American companies.
Questions remain about how the new law will work in practice. Companies are expected to look for ways to diminish its impact through the courts. And regulators will need new funding to pay for their expanded oversight responsibilities, when budgets are under strain from the pandemic.
“The pressure will be intense to show results, and fast,” said Thomas Vinje, a veteran antitrust lawyer in Brussels who has represented Amazon, Microsoft and Spotify.
Tech industry groups criticized the new law as biased against American companies and predicted it would harm innovation in Europe.

“This bill was written to target U.S. tech companies, and its impact will fall on American workers,” said Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of the Chamber of Progress, a trade group in Washington. “European regulations that single out our tech sector threaten American jobs — not just in Silicon Valley, but in cities from Pittsburgh to Birmingham.”
The Digital Markets Act will apply to so-called gatekeeper platforms, which are defined by factors including a market value of more than 75 billion euros, or about $83 billion. The group includes Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube; Amazon; Apple; Microsoft; and Meta.
Specifics of the law read like a wish list for rivals of the biggest companies.
Apple and Google, which make the operating systems that run on nearly every smartphone, would be required to loosen their grip. Apple will have to allow alternatives to its App Store for downloading apps, a change the company has warned could harm security. The law will also let companies such as Spotify and Epic Games use payment methods other than Apple’s in the App Store, which charges a 30 percent commission.
Amazon will be barred from using data collected from outside sellers on its services so that it could offer competing products, a practice that is the subject of a separate E.U. antitrust investigation.
The law will result in major changes for messaging apps. WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, could be required to offer a way for users of rival services like Signal or Telegram to send and receive messages to somebody using WhatsApp. Those rival services would have the option to make their products interoperable with WhatsApp.

The largest sellers of online advertising, Meta and Google, will see new limits for offering targeted ads without consent. Such ads — based on data collected from people as they move between YouTube and Google Search, or Instagram and Facebook — are immensely lucrative for both companies.
“Large gatekeeper platforms have prevented businesses and consumers from the benefits of competitive digital markets,” said Margrethe Vestager, the executive vice president of the European Commission overseeing digital and competition policy, in a statement. The companies, she said, will now “have to comply with a well-defined set of obligations and prohibitions.”
Meta, Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment. Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
Anu Bradford, a Columbia University law professor who coined the term “Brussels Effect” about the influence of E.U. law, said European rules often became global standards because it was easier for companies to apply them across their entire organization rather than one geography.

“Everyone is watching the D.M.A., be it the leading tech companies, their rivals or foreign governments,” Ms. Bradford said, referring to the Digital Markets Act. “It is possible that even the U.S. Congress will now conclude that they are done watching from the sidelines when the E.U. regulates U.S. tech companies and will move from talking about legislative reform to actually legislating.”
President Biden has appointed Lina Khan, a prominent Amazon critic, to lead the Federal Trade Commission and a lawyer critical of the tech giants, Jonathan Kanter, to head the antitrust division of the Department of Justice.
But efforts to change American antitrust laws have moved slowly. Congressional committees have endorsed bills that would stop tech platforms from favoring their own products or buying smaller companies. It is unclear whether the measures have enough support to pass the full House and Senate.
European regulators are now faced with enforcing the new law. G.D.P.R. has been criticized for lack of enforcement.
The European Commission, the executive branch of the bloc, will also have to hire scores of new employees to investigate the tech companies. Years of litigation are expected as companies mount court challenges of future penalties issued as a result of the new law.

Here are some of the potential effects of the new law:
Apple would have to allow alternative app stores for the first time, and companies like Spotify and Epic Games would be allowed to use alternative billing systems inside their apps. Google said this week that it would begin to allow this for some apps.
Speaking of Google, it would have to give Android users options to use other email and search services on handsets in Europe (similar to what it has already been doing in response to a previous E.U. antitrust judgment).
Amazon would be barred from using data collected from outside sellers on its services so that it could offer competing products, a practice that is the subject of a separate E.U. antitrust investigation.
WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, would be required to offer a way for users of rival services like Signal or Telegram to exchange messages with somebody using WhatsApp.

When should companies care about employee tweets?
Last month, Jennifer Sey quit a top job at Levi’s, giving up a potential shot at C.E.O., via an essay that was widely circulated online. In the post, Sey said the clothing company where she had worked for more than 20 years warned her against expressing her personal views on social media, broadcast media and elsewhere, that closing schools during the pandemic made kids worse off. She quit instead of negotiating an exit package, which attracted even more attention to her situation.
Her departure raises issues like whether corporations can control the personal speech of their employees and the politics tied to speaking on certain platforms, like Fox News opinion shows, The Times’s Sapna Maheshwari reports.

This came as Levi’s was trying to set Covid safety protocols in its stores and manage potential pushback from customers and employees. Outside of the company, Sey’s comments drew threats of boycotts. Levi’s said that its social media guidelines allow employees to speak out online, as long as they are mindful of the company’s reputation.
Sey said her speech should have been protected, since she was speaking as a concerned mother, not a corporate executive. She argued she was subject to “viewpoint discrimination” by Levi’s, and said there hadn’t been a problem in the past when she spoke in support of liberal causes.
Complicating matters is that executives are expected to speak out more often on social issues these days. “A private employer can impose restrictions on employees’ speech or conduct,” said Sarah Sobieraj, a professor of sociology at Tufts University. “The key issue here is where that boundary lies and what about when you’re not working.”

Weekend reading: The deal wave
Mark Sirower has been scrutinizing deals for decades, and finding mostly failures. His 1997 book “The Synergy Trap” examined the major mergers of the 1980s, deeming two-thirds of them ultimately unsuccessful.
In a new follow-up with his Deloitte colleague Jeffery Weirens, “The Synergy Solution,” they examine more than 1,000 deals spanning 24 years, worth over $5 trillion — with similarly dismal results. Yet dealmaking is hotter than ever. Sirower talked to DealBook about this moment in mergers. The interview has been edited and condensed.

What’s happening in M.&A.?
It’s staggering by any historical standard. We’re at all-time record highs. In 2021 we had a huge uptick in the value and volume of deals. The value went up roughly 60 percent, to $5.5 trillion. The volume went up 26 percent, to over 60,000 transactions. This is the number that really got me — the number of big deals. Deals over $1 billion doubled in 2021, so 2 percent of deals made up over 65 percent of the value.
How should we interpret these numbers?
This is the fourth merger wave I’ve seen. When we get to this part of the wave, companies tend to be reactive if they’re unprepared. Companies that weren’t doing deals start doing them, or companies that have been acquisitive now start doing more or bigger deals, and at near-all-time-high market valuations.
Why such enthusiasm?
One of the things we’ve learned over time is that M.&A. is highly correlated with rising stock markets. It’s partly optimism, thinking it is going to go on forever.
What’s different about this wave?
In the ’80s and ’90s, it was still pretty much a U.S.-dominated market. Now it’s very much a global market. U.S. targets last year represented less than half of the total deal value.

Proposals by the Biden administration to limit stock buybacks come as companies like Apple spend billions to repurchase their shares.

Matt Rourke/Associated Press
Raising the bar on buybacks
When the Biden administration unveils its annual budget today, it will propose new ways to raise money from big companies and wealthy executives. One of these ideas could rewrite a fundamental practice in corporate America: stock buybacks.
Companies in the S&P 500 repurchased a record $882 billion of their own shares last year. This year is off to an even stronger start, with analysts at Goldman Sachs forecasting that buybacks will set another record, reaching $1 trillion.
The White House plans to propose new restrictions on buybacks, DealBook has learned. This could have further-reaching implications than its plan for a minimum tax for billionaires that’s also expected to be announced today. The buyback proposal goes beyond the 1 percent tax on share repurchases that was part of the administration’s ill-fated $2.2 trillion climate and social spending bill last year, which was meant to raise around $124 billion in tax revenue.

The proposal will call for a three-year freeze on corporate executives selling their shares after a buyback. To support this move, the administration is likely to cite academic research that found company executives tend to sell far more stock in days following a buyback announcement than at any other time. Other research shows that buybacks have accounted for an increasingly large share of corporate profits (often more than 50 percent of net income) over the years. Apple has spent more than $420 billion buying back its shares over the past decade.
Image
The move is sure to revive debate about the merits of buybacks. Supporters say buybacks can be a shrewd use of cash when there are no better alternatives, and give money back to shareholders to reinvest where they see fit. Critics, including prominent Democratic lawmakers, say that they pad executives’ stock-based pay packages by artificially raising stock prices and divert funds from R.&D., hiring additional employees or raising workers’ pay.
The restrictions could do more to deter buybacks than previous proposals. Hitting executives in their wallets by limiting their trades may make buybacks less attractive than just imposing a 1 percent tax, which would be paid by the company. Reversing the trend of ever-rising buybacks could drastically reshape Wall Street: It would diminish a key tool to bolster stock prices.
Some major players in corporate America have already distanced themselves from buybacks. In 2017, Larry Fink of BlackRock admonished companies against buybacks that seem designed only to support stock prices. More recently, shortly after Pat Gelsinger became Intel’s C.E.O. last year, he said that the chip maker — which spent over $80 billion on buybacks in the previous decade — would focus less on repurchases and more on investments in its operations, like building new factories.
Does the buyback proposal have a chance in Congress? In the narrowly divided Senate, it’s unclear whether the two Democratic moderates, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, would support the move, or whether the proposal would survive legal challenges.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Shanghai begins a strict pandemic lockdown. Local authorities today imposed restrictions on the eastern half of China’s financial center until April 1 to conduct mass coronavirus testing; its western half will then be locked down until April 5. Financial firms called employees into the office ahead of the start of restrictions, urging them to sleep at their workplaces.
Search crews recover both flight recorders from the China Eastern Airlines crash. The discovery of the second device could help explain what caused the Boeing 737 to crash. Chinese authorities confirmed that none of the 132 people on board survived.
Part of the U.S. yield curve inverts for the first time in 16 years. Yields on five-year Treasury bonds rose to 2.63 percent, above those for 30-year notes. It’s a sign that investors believe the Fed may raise interest rates so high that it leads to a recession.
States begin suspending gas taxes. Connecticut, Georgia and Maryland are among those that have stopped collecting taxes on gasoline to help consumers weather rising prices. Economists say that such a move may have only a limited effect on blunting the effects of overall inflation.

The latest on the Russia-Ukraine war
President Biden’s ad-lib that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” sent ripple effects throughout the world, with White House officials scrambling to emphasize that regime change is not part of their policy.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine urged Qatar and other energy producers to increase gas exports to Europe, reducing the continent’s reliance on Russia. Russian oil exports are plunging, and some tankers are reportedly concealing their movements by switching off their identification systems, Bloomberg reports.
The latest companies to pull out of Russia include Spotify, which cited new laws restricting free expression, and Heineken, which previously said it would pause investments but now will sell its business there. Some Western firms still operating in Russia aren’t sure whether they are legally allowed to pay rent on their offices.

Should Uncle Sam mint electronic cash?
A national debate over the idea of a digital dollar has heated up since President Biden recently issued an executive order mandating that the Treasury Department study the merits of a central bank digital currency, or C.B.D.C.
It’s about to get more complex, because today Representative Stephen Lynch, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House financial services committee’s fintech task force, is introducing legislation on “electronic cash,” which DealBook is first to report. The bill, called the ECASH Act, injects a new idea into the mix ahead of congressional hearings on C.B.D.C.s.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The ECASH Act is different, said Rohan Grey of Willamette University law school, an expert in currency design and regulation who worked on the bill. Unlike C.B.D.C.s, these e-dollars wouldn’t be issued by the central bank or rely on blockchain technology. It would address privacy and financial inclusion issues that a Fed-issued digital dollar alone cannot, he added. The law would “inform, complement, and advance ongoing efforts” to design and deploy a digital dollar, Lynch said in a statement.
Cash has its advantages: It’s private by design and can be spent without the need for an intermediary, like a bank. The electronic cash proposed in the new bill would work in the same way, with the Treasury building security into the hardware instead of relying on a transaction-recording blockchain, the distributed ledger underlying cryptocurrencies (and C.B.D.C.s). Grey said there have been “productive talks” with both progressive and conservative lawmakers and advocacy groups. A spokesman for the Treasury declined to comment on the bill.
“We should treat sophisticated surveillance technology in the same way we treat sophisticated missile or drone technology.”

When health and antitrust conflict
The F.T.C.’s challenge of a biotech deal challenged is drawing the ire of an unusually varied group of lawmakers who say the agency’s antitrust zeal is endangering lives. Last year, the genomics company Illumina announced the acquisition of Grail, a cancer-testing company it spun off in 2016 that now screens for 50 types of the disease. The F.T.C. sued to block the deal because Illumina is the only gene sequencer for these kinds of tests, arguing that the takeover would diminish the screening market, deterring companies that compete with Grail.
Republicans say that the F.T.C. is prioritizing “speculative economist theory over public health.” This claim was made in a letter by nine Republican lawmakers, including several physicians, sent last week to the commission chairwoman Lina Khan. The letter, which DealBook is first to report, argued that the Illumina-Grail deal can’t be anticompetitive because no similar cancer-screening test exists in the market.
Democrats are critical of the F.T.C.’s approach, too. In recent letters to the Biden administration, Democratic lawmakers, including cancer survivors, expressed concerns about antitrust policy conflicting with President Biden’s “Cancer Moonshot” initiative aiming to cure the disease. And in December, members of the Congressional Black, Hispanic and Asian Pacific American caucuses wrote to the administration about barriers to access, saying: “Our communities do not have the luxury of waiting for economic theories to be debated while we die preventable deaths.”

Resolution probably won’t be swift, which could irk impatient lawmakers even more. The administrative law judge just closed the case record and ordered post-trial briefs, but barring a settlement a decision isn’t expected until late summer (and may be appealed in federal court). Meanwhile, Illumina is in talks with antitrust regulators in Europe about a settlement there, which could be rendered moot by a jurisdictional challenge.

2022-03-29,"This article is part of a limited series on how artificial intelligence has the potential to solve everyday problems.
Imagine: Robots that help teach social skills to children with autism. Translation software that provides deaf students with a more fluid and interactive experience. Data analysis to determine effective methods to identify those with dyslexia.
These tools, which all incorporate artificial intelligence, aim to find better ways to detect, teach and assist those with learning disabilities. Some are already in classrooms; others are still in the research phase.
Social robots, which are made to interact with humans, can help teach social and educational skills to students of all abilities, including those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hearing impairments, Down syndrome and autism.

Addressing the needs of children on the autism spectrum is particularly urgent because of their sheer numbers — one in 54 children are diagnosed with autism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
And those students tend to respond to robots “in a way that they don’t to puppets or pet therapies, or to many of the other kinds of things that we’ve tried,” said Brian Scassellati, a professor of computer science, cognitive science and mechanical engineering at Yale University."

2022-03-31,"Facebook is a leader among tech companies in detecting child sexual abuse content, which has exploded on social media and across the internet in recent years. But concerns about mistakenly accusing people of posting illegal imagery have resulted in a policy that could allow photos and videos of abuse to go unreported.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, has instructed content moderators for its platforms to “err on the side of an adult” when they are uncertain about the age of a person in a photo or video, according to a corporate training document.
Antigone Davis, head of safety for Meta, confirmed the policy in an interview and said it stemmed from privacy concerns for those who post sexual imagery of adults. “The sexual abuse of children online is abhorrent,” Ms. Davis said, emphasizing that Meta employs a multilayered, rigorous review process that flags far more images than any other tech company. She said the consequences of erroneously flagging child sexual abuse could be “life-changing” for users.
While it is impossible to quantify the number of images that might be misclassified, child safety experts said the company was undoubtedly missing some minors. Studies have found that children are physically developing earlier than they have in the past. Also, certain races and ethnicities enter puberty at younger ages, with some Black and Hispanic children, for example, doing so earlier than Caucasians.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“We’re seeing a whole population of youth that is not being protected,” said Lianna McDonald, executive director of the Canadian Center for Child Protection, an organization that tracks the imagery globally.
Each day, moderators review millions of photos and videos from around the world to determine whether they violate Meta’s rules of conduct or are illegal. Last year, the company made nearly 27 million reports of suspected child abuse to a national clearinghouse in Washington that then decides whether to refer them to law enforcement. The company accounts for more than 90 percent of the reports made to the clearinghouse.
The training document, obtained by The New York Times, was created for moderators working for Accenture, a consulting firm that has a contract to sort through Facebook’s noxious content and remove it from the site. The age policy was first disclosed in California Law Review by a law student, Anirudh Krishna, who wrote last year that some moderators at Accenture disagreed with the practice, which they referred to as “bumping up” adolescents to young adults.
Accenture declined to comment on the practice.
Technology companies are legally required to report “apparent” child sexual abuse material, but “apparent” is not defined by the law. The Stored Communications Act, a privacy law, shields companies from liability when making the reports, but Ms. Davis said it was unclear whether the law would protect Meta if it erroneously reported an image. She said lawmakers in Washington needed to establish a “clear and consistent standard” for everyone to follow.

Legal and tech policy experts said that social media companies had a difficult path to navigate. If they fail to report suspected illicit imagery, they can be pursued by the authorities; if they report legal imagery as child sexual abuse material, they can be sued and accused of acting recklessly.

“I could find no courts coming close to answering the question of how to strike this balance,” said Paul Ohm, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department’s computer crime division who is now a professor at Georgetown Law. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable for lawyers in this situation to put the thumb on the scale of the privacy interests.”
Charlotte Willner, who leads an association for online safety professionals and previously worked on safety issues at Facebook and Pinterest, said the privacy concerns meant that companies “aren’t incentivized to take risks.”
But Ms. McDonald, of the Canadian center, said the rules should err on the side of “protecting children,” just as they do in commerce. She cited the example of cigarette and alcohol vendors, who are trained to ask for identification if they have doubts about a customer’s age.
Representatives for Apple; Snap, the owner of Snapchat; and TikTok said their companies took the opposite approach of Meta, reporting any sexual image in which a person’s age was in question. Some other companies that scan their services for illegal imagery, including Dropbox, Google, Microsoft and Twitter, declined to comment on their practices.

In interviews, four former content moderators contracted by Meta said they encountered sexual images every day that were subject to the age policy. The moderators said they could face negative performance reviews if they made too many reports that were deemed out of policy. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements and concerns about future employment.
“They were letting so many things slide that we eventually just didn’t bring things up anymore,” said one of the former moderators, who described detecting images of oral sexual abuse and other explicit acts during his recent two-year tenure at Accenture. “They would have some crazy, extravagant excuse like, ‘That blurry portion could be pubic hairs, so we have to err on the side of it being a young adult.’”
The number of reports of suspected child sexual abuse has grown exponentially in recent years. The high volume, up from roughly 100,000 in 2009, has overwhelmed both the national clearinghouse and law enforcement officials. A 2019 investigation by The Times found that the Federal Bureau of Investigation could only manage its case load from the clearinghouse by limiting its focus to infants and toddlers.
Ms. Davis said a policy that resulted in more reports could worsen the bottleneck. “If the system is too filled with things that are not useful,” she said, “then this creates a real burden.”
But some current and former investigators said the decision should be made by law enforcement.
“No one should decide not to report a possible crime, especially a crime against a child, because they believe that the police are too busy,” said Chuck Cohen, who led a child exploitation task force in Indiana for 14 years.

Dana Miller, the commander of a similar task force in Wisconsin, said tech companies could not know whether a report might be useful in furthering an existing investigation. “Even though everyone is overwhelmed, we’re not comfortable on our side making a blanket statement that we don’t want to see those reports,” she said.
Yiota Souras, general counsel at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for the reports, said the center’s caseload “can’t be at play here.” She said imagery should always be reported if it might involve a child.
How Facebook makes its age determinations is also a point of contention. According to the training document and interviews, Facebook instructs its moderators to incorporate so-called Tanner stages when assessing age. Initially developed in the late 1960s by Dr. James M. Tanner, a British pediatrician, the tool outlines the progressive phases of puberty. But it was not designed to determine someone’s age.
In a 1998 letter to the journal Pediatrics, Dr. Tanner said that using the stages to measure “chronologic age” when analyzing child sexual abuse imagery was “wholly illegitimate.” Dr. Tanner died in 2010. The co-author of the letter, Dr. Arlan L. Rosenbloom, now a retired pediatric endocrinologist, said in an interview that a child at 13 or 14 could be “fully developed” under the Tanner stages. He also characterized Meta’s approach as “a total misuse” of the scale.
Ms. Davis said the scale was widely used in the tech industry and was just one factor in estimating age. She acknowledged its limitations and said the company was exploring alternatives."

Peak jobs
This morning, the Labor Department will report how many jobs employers added to their payrolls in March. Economists expect a healthy gain. But how much longer can the labor market keep it up?
Jobs may be approaching their as-good-as-it-gets moment. Employers have added half a million workers per month to payrolls, on average, for the past year, with some states close to their lowest-ever unemployment levels. (“I’m in hot demand, baby,” a bartender in Nebraska told The Times.) But a number of economists say that rising inflation and higher interest rates could soon shift the labor market into a lower gear. Goldman Sachs’s top economist, Jan Hatzius, predicts that the pace of hiring will slow to 200,000 a month over the next quarter, and drift downward from there.
The big problem is a lack of workers. Long before the pandemic, the percentage of Americans participating in the work force — those who had a job or were actively looking for one — had been declining. That had a lot to do with demographics, namely retiring Boomers. The participation rate has bounced up from its pandemic low, but has a ways to go to recover its prepandemic level, much less the higher rates of previous decades. If the long-term trend of falling participation rates resumes, “there will not be the numbers of people out there to fill these jobs,” Joel Naroff of Naroff Economics told DealBook.
The pandemic accelerated the drop in participation for all workers, not just older ones. It has also changed attitudes toward traditional ways of working. A recent poll by the work force management company MBO found that 30 percent of workers in full-time jobs and 70 percent of independent contractors think that they would have more job security if they worked for themselves. That’s up sharply from 2020.
Will the economy recover all of the jobs lost during the pandemic before the next downturn? The economy is roughly two million jobs short of its prepandemic peak. Goldman’s Hatzius forecasts that it would take until January to close that gap. That is, unless the U.S. slips into recession before then, a possibility that more market watchers have been discussing. “It’s a question of when we will have the next recession,” the Deloitte economist Daniel Bachman told DealBook. “Sometime, and it is likely to happen over the next 12 months, we are going to hit the job market’s upper limit.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Mortgage rates hit a four-year high. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 4.67 percent, its highest level since 2018, according to Freddie Mac. While rates had been expected to rise, they have accelerated more than anticipated. Analysts said, however, that this was unlikely to deter buyers for now.
European leaders reject Moscow’s demand to pay for Russian gas in rubles. President Vladimir Putin has insisted that foreign buyers open ruble accounts with Russian banks by today, in a likely effort to shore up his country’s currency. But Germany and Italy, Russia’s two largest energy customers in Europe, said they would continue to pay in euros. It is unclear how the standoff will be resolved.
The Rise of Electric Vehicles
Affordable Models: More efficient manufacturing, falling battery costs and intense competition are lowering sticker prices for battery-powered vehicles to within striking distance of gasoline cars.
Keeping China Out: President Biden wants to shield American producers of electric vehicles from cheaper Chinese options. Here are the policy and political considerations of Biden’s efforts.
Retiring the Malibu: General Motors said that it would stop making the Chevrolet Malibu, the last affordable sedan in its U.S. model lineup, to produce more electric cars.
Tesla’s Pullback: The automaker led by Elon Musk is no longer planning to take the lead in expanding the number of places to fuel electric vehicles. It’s not clear how quickly other companies will fill the gap.
The Senate nears a deal on a $10 billion Covid aid package. That is less than half the White House’s original request, but would advance the stalled legislation after President Biden asked for more money to fund vaccinations and therapeutics.
“No” votes are narrowly ahead in an Amazon warehouse union election. So far, 875 votes have been cast in favor of unionizing an Alabama warehouse, versus 993 against, though over 400 ballots are being challenged.

Why aren’t high gas prices helping E.V. stocks?
In recent years, when U.S. gas prices have risen, so have sales of hybrid, electric and compact vehicles. Yet with the average price of a gallon running at its highest in many years, S.U.V.s and other gas guzzlers are still being driven off lots.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It’s about trade-offs: A shortage of fuel-efficient cars has pushed the price of those available to the point where fewer consumers see a payoff in making the switch. That’s also reflected in the subdued performance of the stocks of many electric vehicle makers. Despite a spike in gas prices, shares of Lucid and Rivian have lagged the market this year. It was the same for Tesla until recently, with a big gain in recent days linked to a stock split.
E.V. investors are more worried about supply than demand. Nickel, a key Russian export, is a major component in electric vehicle batteries. Dan Ives, who covers E.V. stocks for Wedbush Securities, estimated that a shortage of nickel and other rising costs could force E.V. makers to raise prices by $1,200 per vehicle. That is weighing on the sector, he said, even if higher gas prices eventually lead to higher demand for electric cars. The pandemic also continues to be an issue: Volkswagen and Tesla temporarily shut factories in Shanghai this week, as a result of a lockdown there.
Policymakers are trying to do something about it. Yesterday, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to increase domestic production of minerals needed for electric vehicles, like nickel, lithium and cobalt. The president said that the country depended on “unreliable foreign sources” for many materials necessary for transitioning to the use of clean energy. The action isn’t expected to include loans or direct purchases, and may face opposition from environmentalists, including some in Biden’s own party.
“This is a transition, and transitions are painful. But near-zero interest rates weren’t sustainable. It will be a good thing if rates are higher. That should improve the outlook for stocks and bonds over the long term, once we get through it.”
— Joe Davis, the chief economist for Vanguard, on the outlook for the market as interest rates rise and bonds get pummeled.

Deal-making takes a hit
Global M.&A. was worth just over $1 trillion in the first quarter, down 20 percent from the same time a year ago, according to Refinitiv. Deal makers had expected a slowdown from 2021’s record-setting pace, as rising inflation and the war in Ukraine made companies more cautious about what they do with their cash.
But the data also reveals a noteworthy appetite for very big deals: The value and volume of takeovers worth $10 billion was up sharply in the first quarter despite increased scrutiny from antitrust regulators and other factors that dampened enthusiasm for smaller deals.

Agents of change
Can the power of pop culture be harnessed to promote democracy? This question is what drove the CAA Foundation — the philanthropic arm of the Hollywood talent agency CAA — to team up with Democracy Works and create the Civic Alliance, a coalition of more than 1,250 companies supporting election engagement. Members include Amazon, Coca-Cola, Levi’s, McDonald’s, Microsoft and Starbucks.
“2020 was a tipping point,” Natalie Tran, the CAA Foundation’s executive director, told DealBook. “I don’t think we can go back from that. The expectations for civic engagement from businesses have transformed in the last two years.”
The origin story: Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, Tran had been seeking guidance on civics through a company lens. She wanted to promote engagement at CAA but wasn’t an expert and quickly discovered that people in her position at other companies were in search of similar information. They found little. “It’s impossible for businesses to respond to the engagement expectations without tools and resources,” Tran said. The alliance recently published the Corporate Civic Playbook, a guide it developed for members.

The playbook makes the business case for engagement. Based on the performance of the alliance’s publicly traded companies, civic engagement pays off: These companies outperformed the S&P 500 during the 2020 election campaign and in “the consequential moments for our democracy in the months that followed,” according to the alliance. “People always say democracy is good for business,” Tran said. “We wanted to prove that with data.”
The midterms are generating “presidential election energy,” Tran said. The alliance’s goal is to make civic engagement an every day, every election kind of thing, down to the local level, Tran said: “We’re equipping companies to build a sustainable culture of civic participation.”

2022-04-02,"RIO DE JANEIRO — In February, a think tank in São Paulo was looking for a financial coordinator. The job was remote, the work was part time and, the post on LinkedIn said, Black and Indigenous candidates were preferred.
For Brazil, the ad was innocuous. Many Brazilian companies have started to explicitly seek out Black and Indigenous workers to diversify their ranks, a step to reverse the deep inequality that has racked the country since the area was first settled centuries ago.
Then LinkedIn, which is dominant in Brazil, removed the listing, setting off a debate over why a company based in California should be controlling how a country in South America deals with its racist past and present. Over the next month, dozens of large companies protested, federal prosecutors opened inquiries and activists sued.
This past week, LinkedIn reversed its stance. The company, which is owned by Microsoft, said it had learned from the experience in Brazil and changed its global policy to allow job listings that explicitly pursue candidates who are “members of groups historically disadvantaged in hiring.”

The case was the latest illustration of how a handful of American tech companies exert enormous influence in foreign countries, enforcing global policies that often clash with those cultures or bring strife, abuse or other unintended consequences.
“There are a lot of pros to global connectivity that I would hate to give up,” said Eileen Donahoe, a former Obama administration official who now studies global digital policies at Stanford University. “But what’s coming to the surface in this instance is the underside of that global connectivity and global dominance.”
In this case, the backlash succeeded in changing LinkedIn’s rules, not only in Brazil, but also across the world. LinkedIn’s about-face shows how countries are increasingly pushing back against big tech companies and forcing changes in their policies, with global implications.
A European data-privacy law that went into effect in 2018 largely led to the worldwide proliferation of alerts on websites that ask visitors to accept “cookies,” or the tracking software embedded behind most web pages. The European Union is now set to approve new rules that could force tech companies to make their messaging apps work with rivals’ products, probably affecting people far beyond the bloc. And late last year, an investigation in Japan caused Apple to revise important rules for many app makers, while guidelines in Britain prompted tech giants to alter how their products work to protect minors better across the world.

“Often the trend has been an actual law, or government regulation” forcing tech companies to rethink policies, Ms. Donahoe said. But with the LinkedIn case, she said, “This was more public outcry.”

Like many countries, Brazil has a brutal history of racism. From the arrival of the first European settlers, Indigenous people were slaughtered for hundreds of years. Brazil imported more slaves than any other country and was the last nation in the Americas to abolish slavery, in 1888. And today, in a country where more than half the population is Black, Black people hold fewer than 1 in 100 corporate management positions, according to one study.

Clashing Climate Goals: The state-owned company Petrobras could soon be the world’s third-biggest oil producer, even as Brazil positions itself as a leader in the fight against climate change and deforestation in the Amazon.
The fight for equality has gained steam in recent years, in part fueled by a surge of affirmative action programs. In 2020, Magazine Luiza, a Brazilian retail giant with more than 1,400 stores, announced that its executive trainee program would be open only to Black candidates.
The announcement ignited a national debate. Many conservatives in Brazil criticized the company, calling its policy racist, while many on the left cheered it on. “We were ‘canceled’ on social media, even by congressmen,” said Frederico Trajano, Magazine Luiza’s chief executive. Yet since then, similar policies in Brazil “have taken off,” he said. “The number of new initiatives is impressive.”
In the United States, companies including Google, Twitter and J.P. Morgan have introduced internship programs in recent years that are limited to certain minorities, framed as a way to create a more diverse pipeline of talent. But while there have been broad efforts to diversify the white-collar workforces at many American companies, U.S. law generally prohibits job ads that show a preference for a specific race.

In Brazil, several recent court decisions have upheld affirmative action policies, making the law more clear that companies can give preference to Black and Indigenous employees, said Elisiane Santos, a prosecutor in the federal labor prosecutor’s office. “It certainly is legal,” she said.
As a result, companies have become bolder. So when Laut, a research institute in São Paulo, posted its ad for a financial coordinator that “gave preference” to Black and Indigenous candidates, the move was hardly groundbreaking. It was more surprising when, three days later, on Feb. 28, LinkedIn removed the ad and told Laut, the Center for the Analysis of Freedom and Authoritarianism, in an email that the listing violated its policies.
Natura & Co., a Brazilian personal beauty company with 35,000 employees, later said that LinkedIn had also taken down its ad seeking a person of color for a management job.
The move by LinkedIn revived the national debate on affirmative action policies. LinkedIn was targeted by the left and seen as a champion of the right.
“LinkedIn’s stance toward Brazil is a colonialist use of the law to protect racism,” Pedro Abramovay, the former No. 2 official in Brazil’s Justice Department, said on Twitter.

LinkedIn’s official account responded, saying its policy applied to all users globally and prohibited job listings that give preference to, or exclude, candidates based on “age, gender, religion, ethnicity, race or sexual orientation.”
Raphael Vicente, a São Paulo lawyer and professor who runs an initiative to promote affirmative action policies, began gathering signatures from corporations for a letter protesting the policy. More than 40 companies signed on, including Coca-Cola, Intel, Procter & Gamble, Bayer and Unilever. “Such a policy can be a huge setback for the country,” Mr. Vicente wrote, adding that it would reverse the effect of the affirmative action programs that activists like him had fought for.

LinkedIn is dominant in Brazil for job listings. Brazil is LinkedIn’s third-largest market, after the United States and India, with 55 million users, or one in every four people in Brazil.
After LinkedIn took down the ads, the federal prosecutor’s office in São Paulo, the federal labor prosecutor and a federal consumer-rights agency all sent notices to the company requesting more information. Educafro, a racial-justice group, then sued LinkedIn, saying its policy was racist and violated Brazilian law. The group asked for more than $2 million in damages, which it said it would use for education programs for Black people.

On Tuesday, after The New York Times sought comment on its removal of the job listings, LinkedIn said it was changing its policy to allow such ads, as long as they are legal in a given country. “Getting this right is important and we’re committed to continuing to learn and improve,” the company said in a statement. It declined to comment further.
In 2010, a federal law in Brazil required companies to create “equal opportunities in the labor market for the Black population,” though it did not specify how. In 2012, Brazil’s Supreme Court backed racial quotas in public universities. And in 2014, a new law required that 20 percent of people hired through public service exams be Black.
Mr. Vicente said that when he and other activists began pushing affirmative action in Brazil in 2015, Brazilian companies still balked. “Now a global company has had to retreat on the subject,” he said. “This message to companies here is very clear.”"

2022-04-06,"WASHINGTON — The United States said on Wednesday that it had secretly removed malware from computer networks around the world in recent weeks, a step to pre-empt Russian cyberattacks and send a message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
The move, made public by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, comes as U.S. officials warn that Russia could try to strike American critical infrastructure — including financial firms, pipelines and the electric grid — in response to the crushing sanctions that the United States has imposed on Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
The malware enabled the Russians to create “botnets” — networks of private computers that are infected with malicious software and controlled by the G.R.U., the intelligence arm of the Russian military. But it is unclear what the malware was intended to do, since it could be used for everything from surveillance to destructive attacks.
An American official said on Wednesday that the United States did not want to wait to find out. Armed with secret court orders in the United States and the help of governments around the world, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. disconnected the networks from the G.R.U.’s own controllers.

“Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used,” Mr. Garland said.
The court orders allowed the F.B.I. to go into domestic corporate networks and remove the malware, sometimes without the company’s knowledge.
President Biden has repeatedly said he would not put the U.S. military in direct conflict with the Russian military, a situation he has said could lead to World War III. That is why he refused to use the U.S. Air Force to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine or to permit the transfer of fighter jets to Ukraine from NATO air bases.
But his hesitance does not appear to extend to cyberspace. The operation that was revealed on Wednesday showed a willingness to disarm the main intelligence unit of the Russian military from computer networks inside the United States and around the world. It is also the latest effort by the Biden administration to frustrate Russian actions by making them public before Moscow can strike.
Even as the United States works to prevent Russian attacks, some American officials fear Mr. Putin may be biding his time in launching a major cyberoperation that could strike a blow at the American economy.
Until now, American officials say, the primary Russian cyberactions have been directed at Ukraine — including “wiper” malware designed to cripple Ukrainian government offices and an attack on a European satellite system called Viasat. The details of the satellite attack, one of the first of its kind, are of particular concern to the Pentagon and American intelligence agencies, which fear it may have exposed vulnerabilities in critical communications systems that the Russians and others could exploit.

The Biden administration has instructed critical infrastructure companies in the United States to prepare to fend off Russian cyberattacks, and intelligence officials in Britain have echoed those warnings. And while Russian hackers have sometimes preferred to quietly infiltrate networks and gather information, researchers said that recent malware activity in Ukraine demonstrated Russia’s increasing willingness to cause digital damage.
“They are engaged in a cyberwar there that is pretty intense, but it is targeted,” said Tom Burt, a Microsoft executive who oversees the company’s efforts to counter major cyberattacks and shut down an attack in Ukraine during the opening of the war.
Security experts suspect that Russia may be responsible for other cyberattacks that have occurred since the war began, including on Ukrainian communications services, although investigations into some of those attacks are ongoing.
In January, as diplomats from the United States prepared to meet with their Russian counterparts in an attempt to avoid military conflict in Ukraine, Russian hackers already were putting the finishing touches on a new piece of destructive malware.
The code was designed to delete data and render computer systems inoperable. In its wake, the malware left a note for victims, taunting them about losing information. Before U.S. and Russian representatives met for a final attempt at diplomacy, hackers had already begun using the malware to attack Ukrainian critical infrastructure, including government agencies responsible for food safety, finance and law enforcement.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Adam Meyers, the senior vice president for intelligence at CrowdStrike, who analyzed the malware used in the January attacks and linked the group to Russia, said the group intended to cause damage and aid Russian military objectives.
“It’s a relatively new group, clearly purpose-built with a disruptive capability in mind,” Mr. Meyers said. “The emergence of it is a progression of a continued demand from Russian forces for cyber operational support.”
Another attack occurred on Feb. 24, the day that Russia invaded Ukraine, when hackers knocked Viasat offline. The attack flooded modems with malicious traffic and disrupted internet services for several thousand people in Ukraine and tens of thousands of other customers across Europe, Viasat said in a statement. The attack also spilled over into Germany, disrupting operations of wind turbines there.
Viasat said that the hack remained under investigation by law enforcement, U.S. and international government officials and Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that it hired to look into the matter, and it did not attribute the attack to Russia or any other state-backed group.
But senior U.S. officials said all evidence suggested Russia was responsible, and security researchers at SentinelOne said the malware used in the Viasat attack was similar to code that has been linked to the G.R.U. The United States has not formally named Russia as the source of the attack but is expected to do so as soon as several allies join in the analysis.

In late March, a cyberattack again disrupted communications services in Ukraine. This time, the attack focused on Ukrtelecom, a telephone and internet service provider, knocking the company’s services offline for several hours. The attack was “an ongoing and intensifying nation-scale disruption to service, which is the most severe registered since the invasion by Russia,” according to NetBlocks, a group that tracks internet outages.
Ukrainian officials believe that Russia was most likely responsible for the attack, which has not yet been traced to a particular hacking group.
“Russia was interested in cutting off communication between armed forces, between our troops, and that was partially successful in the very beginning of the war,” said Victor Zhora, a top official at Ukraine’s cybersecurity agency, the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. Ukrainian officials said Russia had also been behind attempts to spread disinformation about a surrender.
In the United States, officials fear similar cyberattacks could hit critical infrastructure companies. Some executives said they hoped the federal government would offer funding for cybersecurity.
“I am perfectly well aware that if Russia as a nation-state decided it wanted to attack the national infrastructure of the U.S., including what I’m responsible for, I don’t have much chance of stopping them,” said Peter Fletcher, the information security officer for the San Jose Water Company, which is part of a group that manages water services in several states. “The entire Russian nation-state versus Peter? I’m going to lose.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Fletcher said that he was prepared but that smaller water companies than his own often struggled to keep up with cybersecurity demands. Many of them rely on outdated technology to pump and treat water, which could make them attractive hacking targets, he said.
Community Electric Cooperative, a utility provider that serves about 12,000 customers in Virginia, estimated that it needed $50,000 to upgrade cybersecurity systems. The utility has already trained its staff on how to detect cyberattacks and has tested its systems, but representatives said the cooperative hoped to do even more in preparation for a potential cyberattack from Russia.
“If we don’t have the capabilities to prevent this stuff and we are the grid, it could be quite detrimental,” said Jessica Parr, Community Electric Cooperative’s communications director.
Despite the challenges, critical infrastructure providers said they were accustomed to handling disasters. “We deal with hurricanes and ice storms all year,” Ms. Parr said. “This is just a different type of storm.”

The way that the gun industry advertises its products faces growing scrutiny.
Credit...
Daniel Acker for The New York Times
Illusion of safety?
Gun control advocates are petitioning the Federal Trade Commission today to investigate and regulate the firearms industry as it has with tobacco, alleging that gun manufacturers use deceptive advertising practices.
The petition, which DealBook is first to report, is the latest salvo aimed at the marketing tactics of an industry that has largely been protected from liability for the harms of its products because of federal laws. The groups urging action by the F.T.C. include Brady, the Giffords Law Center, March for Our Lives and the Firearms Accountability Counsel Taskforce.
Gun marketing promotes an illusion of safety, the petitioners say. Americans have “been falsely led to believe that gun ownership is a safe way to protect their home and family,” they argue. The C.D.C. reported 45,222 deaths from gun-related injuries in 2020 (an earlier version of this item misstated the year, because of an editing error). The F.T.C. “has effectively given the gun industry a free pass,” the petitioners say.

Advocates have asked the F.T.C. to investigate the gun industry before, starting in 1996. The F.T.C. can choose to address or ignore this latest petition, which comes as the Biden administration has expressed support for more transparency on gun manufacturers’ operations and state-level lawsuits have begun to break through the industry’s barriers to litigation.
In February, the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims settled a suit for $73 million against Remington that alleged the gun maker’s aggressive marketing violated Connecticut law by promoting firearms to troubled men like the one responsible for the massacre. The settlement opens internal company documents to scrutiny, which would offer a rare view into how gun makers like Remington develop their marketing messages. President Biden described it as a step in “holding gun manufacturers accountable for manufacturing weapons of war and irresponsibly marketing these firearms.”
Last year, a New Jersey judge ruled in favor of the state’s attorney general in a lawsuit against Smith & Wesson for its advertising practices, requiring the company to release internal documents. The ruling was recently overturned, leaving the state’s lawsuit intact but the release of documents uncertain. Smith & Wesson said in a filing that the suit sought to “suppress and punish lawful speech regarding gun ownership in order to advance an anti-Second Amendment agenda.”
The F.T.C.’s enforcement of federal consumer protection law could look to these state precedents, like the Connecticut consumer law that allowed the Sandy Hook families to sue. “If a company violates the consumer protection laws with false advertisements, that is not protected activity,” said David Pucino of the Giffords Law Center. “They are breaking the law.”

Today, in her first speech focusing on digital asset regulation, she will call for “a consistent and comprehensive policy framework that promotes responsible innovation of digital assets and appropriately assesses and mitigates the risks they may pose,” backing up President Biden’s recent executive order on crypto.
Central bankers are backing higher interest rates. The minutes from the Fed’s March meeting said that “many” officials would have preferred a bigger rate increase than the quarter-point rise they settled on, but held off because of concerns over the impact of the war in Ukraine. Markets now expect the Fed to make half-point increases in May and possibly June.
Corporate bankruptcy filings are at their lowest levels in over a decade. Only 87 U.S. businesses filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of the year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, the lowest first-quarter total in at least 13 years. Companies have benefited from pandemic stimulus programs and cheap funding, but rising interest rates may put balance sheets under more pressure in the quarters ahead.

Insuring Elon Musk
Twitter’s investors appear convinced that Elon Musk can make the social media company better. The company’s stock is up 30 percent since the news broke that Musk had bought a large stake in Twitter and would join its board. That has added some $9 billion to the company’s market value. But when Musk becomes a director at Twitter, he may also bring some costs.

What will happen to Twitter’s insurance premiums? Most public companies carry policies that shield directors and officers from personal liability, known as D&O insurance. Musk’s past legal run-ins include a settlement with the S.E.C. over a market-moving tweet about Tesla (which Musk is trying to scrap) and a defamation lawsuit by a British cave explorer, whom Musk called a “pedo guy” in a tweet (which Musk won). In buying his Twitter stake, Musk appears to have filed the required disclosures late and may have initially used the wrong type of form. “I would be very concerned if I was the insurance company asked to underwrite and provide it,” Peter Taffae, a managing partner of the D&O insurance brokerage Executive Perils, told DealBook.

Tesla has faced high premiums in the past because of Musk. After Musk settled with the S.E.C., Tesla said in a regulatory filing that insurers were asking for “disproportionately high premiums” for D&O insurance. Instead, Musk briefly insured the company himself. Tesla paid him $3 million for a three-month term before it signed a new policy with “third-party carriers.”
Twitter has had its own issues. Last year, the company reached an $800 million settlement with shareholders in a lawsuit that claimed Twitter had inflated its user numbers. “Twitter had its own D&O challenges even before adding Musk,” said Priya Cherian Huskins, a partner at Woodruff Sawyer. “Adding Musk to the board might be a great thing for investors, but the calculus for insurers is different.”
“By the way, Amazon, here we come. Watch.”

Days before, workers at an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island voted to form a union, the first in the U.S. at the e-commerce giant. (The White House later said that the president was merely expressing general support for unions.) Meanwhile, the success of the independent, crowd-funded union drive at Amazon has traditional labor unions rethinking their tactics.

Pay days
Many public companies in the U.S. are approaching the deadline to file their annual proxy statements, which among other things detail how much top executives were paid in the prior year. And while wages are up for the average worker, many C.E.O.s got much bigger raises.
This week, The Wall Street Journal ran the numbers for companies that have reported so far, and found that the average C.E.O. in the S&P 500 received an 11 percent raise last year, to levels nearly 190 times what the median worker earned. In a year of pandemic disruptions, when many people’s pay lagged inflation, executive pay packages are likely to draw scrutiny, especially from those who want to raise taxes on the wealthiest.
Here are a few of the biggest C.E.O. compensation packages of 2021 so far, which include the value of stock-based pay that may not be realized if performance targets aren’t met:
Joseph Bae and Scott Nuttall, co-C.E.O.s of KKR
Pay: $560 million (Bae) and $523 million (Nuttall)

2022-04-12,"When Google employees returned to their mostly empty offices this month, they were told to relax. Office time should be “not only productive but also fun.” Explore the place a little. Don’t book back-to-back meetings.
Also, don’t forget to attend the private show by Lizzo, one of the hottest pop stars in the country. If that’s not enough, the company is also planning “pop-up events” that will feature “every Googler’s favorite duo: food and swag.”
But Google employees in Boulder, Colo., were still reminded of what they were giving up when the company gave them mouse pads with the image of a sad-eyed cat. Underneath the pet was a plea: “You’re not going to RTO, right?”
R.T.O., for return to office, is an abbreviation born of the pandemic. It is a recognition of how Covid-19 forced many companies to abandon office buildings and empty cubicles. The pandemic proved that being in the office does not necessarily equal greater productivity, and some firms continued to thrive without meeting in person.

Now, after two years of video meetings and Slack chats, many companies are eager to get employees back to their desks. The employees, however, may be not be so eager for a return to morning commutes, communal bathrooms and daytime outfits that are not athletic wear.
So tech companies with money to burn and offices to fill are rolling out the fun wagon, even as they make clear that in many cases returning to the office — at least a few days a week — is mandatory.
Lizzo will perform for Google employees this month at an amphitheater near the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. When Microsoft reopened its offices in Redmond, Wash., in late February, employees were treated to music from local bands, beer and wine tasting, and even classes for making terrariums.
To mark its first official week back at the office, the chip maker Qualcomm held a happy hour with its chief executive, Cristiano Amon, at its San Diego offices for several thousand employees with free food, drink and T-shirts. The company also started offering weekly events such as pop-up snack stands on “Take a Break Tuesday” and group fitness classes for “Wellness Wednesday.”

“These celebrations and perks are a recognition by companies that they know employees don’t want to come back to the office, certainly not as frequently as before,” said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia University’s business school. At least for now, he added, companies are opting for the carrot over the stick: rewarding workers for coming into the office rather than punishing them for staying home.

Before Covid struck, the biggest technology firms committed billions of dollars to erect offices that are marvels of architecture and trophies of financial success. Those gleaming offices, packed with amenities and perks, are a testament to the long-held belief that in-person collaboration is still better for fostering creativity, inspiring innovation and instilling a common sense of purpose.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
But for many employees who enjoyed the freedom of working remotely, the return to office — no matter how fancy — carries a touch of end-of-summer, back-to-school dread. Few, it seems, are keen on going back five days a week.
On Memegen, an internal company site where Google employees share memes, one of the most popular posts was a picture of a company cafeteria with a caption: “RTO is just bumping into each other and saying ‘we must grab lunch soon’ until one of you quits Google.”
Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who surveys 5,000 workers every month, said most wanted to return to the office two or three times per week. One-third never want to return to the office and prefer to remain remote.

Just by eliminating the office commute, Mr. Bloom said, the average worker will save one hour a day, so “you can see why employees are not going to start coming to work for free bagels or to play Ping-Pong.” The main draw for heading to the office, according to the surveys, is that employees want to see colleagues in person.
After a number of postponements, Google kicked off its hybrid work schedule on April 4, requiring most employees to show up at U.S. offices a few days a week. Apple started easing staff back to the office on Monday, with workers expected to check in at the office once a week at first.
On March 31, David Radcliffe, Google’s vice president of real estate and workplace services, sent an email to San Francisco Bay Area employees saying the company wanted to make the return to office “truly special.”

For years, Google has provided employees with Wi-Fi-equipped luxury buses to make commutes more productive and comfortable, but it’s going a step further. It is starting a program to reimburse $49 monthly leases for an electric scooter as part of its transportation options for staff. Google also plans to also start experimenting with different office designs to adapt to changing work styles.

When Microsoft employees returned to their offices in February as part of a hybrid work schedule, they were greeted with “appreciation events” and lawn games such as cornhole and life-size chess. There were classes for spring basket making and canvas painting. The campus pub transformed into a beer, wine and “mocktail” garden.
And, of course, there was free food and drink: pizzas, sandwiches and specialty coffees. Microsoft paid for food trucks with offerings including fried chicken, tacos, gyros, Korean food and barbecue.
Unlike other technology companies, Microsoft expects employees to pay for their own food at the office. One employee marveled at how big a draw the free food was.
The challenge for companies, Mr. Bloom said, is how to balance flexibility in letting workers set their own schedule with a more heavy-handed approach of forcing them to come in on specific days to maximize the usefulness of office time.

He said companies should focus on developing the right approach to hybrid work instead of wasting time and effort on showering employees with inducements like private concerts.
“Employees aren’t going to come in regularly just for the frills,” Mr. Bloom said. “What are you going to do next? Get Justin Bieber and then Katy Perry?”
Fitting of Apple’s more restrained workplace, its employees said they did not expect — nor had they heard of — any celebrations for returning to the office. At first, Apple is asking employees to come once a week. By late May, Apple is requiring them to come in on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.

When Apple announced its return-to-office plan last year before another Covid surge forced a delay, more than 1,000 employees signed a letter urging management to be more open to flexible work arrangements. It was a rare show of dissent from the company’s rank-and-file, who historically have been less willing to openly challenge executives on workplace matters.

But as tech companies grapple with offering employees greater work flexibility, the firms are also scaling back some office perks.
Meta, formerly known as Facebook, told employees last month that it was cutting back or eliminating free services like laundry and dry cleaning. Google, like some other companies, has said it approved requests from thousands of employees to work remotely or transfer to a different office. But if employees move to a less expensive location, Google is cutting pay, arguing that it has always factored in where a person was hired in setting compensation.
Clio, a legal software company in Burnaby, British Columbia, won’t force its employees back to the office. But last week, it gave a party at its offices.
There was upbeat music. There was an asymmetrical balloon sculpture in Clio’s signature bright blue, dark blue, coral and white — perfect for selfies. One of Clio’s best-known workers donned a safari costume to give tours of the facility. At 2 p.m., the company held a cupcake social.
To make its work spaces feel more like home, the company moved desks to the perimeter, allowing Clions — what the company calls its employees — to gaze out at the office complex’s cherry blossoms while banging out emails. A foosball table was upgraded to a workstation with chairs on either end, “so you could have a meeting while playing foosball with your laptop on it,” said Natalie Archibald, Clio’s vice president of people.

Clio’s Burnaby office, which employs 350, is open at only half capacity. Spaced-out desks must be reserved, and employees got red, yellow and green lanyards to convey their comfort levels with handshakes.
Only around 60 people came in that Monday. “To be able to have an IRL laugh rather than an emoji response,” Ms. Archibald said. “People are just excited for that.”

Some see a high-water mark for inflation
Inflation in the U.S. was running at 8.5 percent in the year to March, new data showed yesterday, the highest level in more than 40 years.
Surprisingly, that brought an optimistic response from some of the economists who have spent the past year warning about price rises. “These numbers are likely to represent something of a peak,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon.
Several market watchers see signs that inflation may be subsiding, The Times’s Jeanna Smialek reports:
A surge in gas prices accounted for much of the jump in prices last month. Strip out gas and food, as many economists do, and so-called core inflation actually decelerated from February to March.
Prices for goods that have been driving inflation recently, like used cars and consumer electronics, dropped or rose less than expected, a sign that snarled supply chains could be easing.
There’s also the “base effect,” a quirk of how the numbers are reported that can affect how much inflation there appears to be. Prices really began to pop last spring, which means that after spring this year, changes will be measured against a higher year-ago number, or base.
But policymakers aren’t sitting back. New Zealand’s central bank surprised economists with a larger-than-expected half-point interest rate increase today, a move that other central banks may follow. The central bank in Canada is expected to announce a big rate increase today, and the Fed and the Bank of England will probably do the same next month. (Britain’s inflation rate hit a 30-year high in numbers released today.)
And not everyone buys the “peak inflation” narrative. The data is not definitive, with the latest prices for some categories, like furniture, rising sharply. Wages are also up, raising costs for employers and potentially prompting them to continue lifting prices (and many workers’ paychecks are still not keeping up with inflation). Pandemic shutdowns in China threaten global supply chains and the war in Ukraine adds a huge dose of uncertainty.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A subway gunman is still at large in New York. The police identified a “person of interest” in the shooting of 10 people on a Brooklyn train yesterday. He appears to have posted lengthy, bigoted rants on social media, some criticizing the policies of New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams. The Times has a live briefing with the latest developments.
JPMorgan Chase kicks off the earnings season for big banks. It slightly missed expectations for its first-quarter profit, which was down some 40 percent from the same period last year, hit by some $500 million in losses on Russian assets and other war-related market effects. Earnings are scheduled tomorrow from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.
Airlines beat Wall Street forecasts as travel rebounds. Delta reported a narrower first-quarter loss and predicted a return to profit in the second quarter. American told investors yesterday that it expected slightly higher revenue than previously forecast. Boeing also reported a rebound in sales, with strong orders for the 737 Max.
Mark Zuckerberg says he will no longer donate to local election offices. He gave nearly half a billion dollars in 2020 to shore up voting infrastructure during the pandemic. Some conservatives claimed, without evidence, that the money helped President Biden win.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
Lockdowns in China could sharply cut the global demand for oil. In its latest monthly assessment, the International Energy Agency said that China’s restrictions could ease the supply crunch caused by sanctions on Russia. Emergency reserve releases and increased production from the Middle East and U.S. may help, too, but the outlook is “mired in uncertainty,” the agency said.

Can tech companies lure workers back?
Tech companies have long been leaders in giving workers the flexibility to work remotely. But they have also spent billions on lavish office spaces that they see as crucibles of collaboration and creativity. And as the pandemic eases, they are trying to shift the balance back toward the office, using both carrots and sticks.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The industry’s appetite for office space remains strong: Meta is planning to add roughly 300,000 square feet in Manhattan, and Google announced this morning that it is investing another $9.5 billion in U.S. offices and data centers this year, especially outside California in places like Atlanta, Austin, Pittsburgh and Portland.
Tech companies want their workers to be happy about returning, so they’re offering perks, The Times’s Daisuke Wakabayashi, Erin Griffith and Kate Conger report. The pop star Lizzo will perform for Google employees this month near the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. When Microsoft reopened its office, it offered live music, beer and wine tasting, and terrarium-making classes.
But many employees are dreading a full return. In New York, yesterday’s subway attack and an overall rise in crime on trains could increase concerns about safety. According to Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford, one-third of workers he surveyed never want to go back. “Employees aren’t going to come in regularly just for the frills,” he said. The main draw is seeing colleagues.
Tech firms are making clear that in many cases returning to the office is mandatory. After several postponements, Google kicked off its hybrid work schedule April 4, requiring most employees in the U.S. at their offices a few days a week. Apple started easing staff back to the office on Monday, with workers expected once a week for now. Microsoft reopened its offices in Redmond, Wash., on a hybrid basis in late February.
“They’re not countering the pandemic. They’re creating disasters.”

A pioneering executive is leaving Goldman Sachs
Maeve DuVally, a longtime communications executive at Goldman Sachs, is retiring from the bank in June after a nearly 18-year run. DuVally is not going far — she will advise Goldman Sachs as a consultant, focusing on both corporate communications and diversity and inclusion. Her retirement comes a little more than a year after Jake Siewert, the comms chief who led the firm’s reputation makeover after the financial crisis, left for Warburg Pincus.
DuVally broke boundaries. She came out as transgender during her tenure, a move the bank supported. DuVally recently recalled her decision: “Coming out at work was probably one of the happiest days of my life, and I’ve never looked back.” The bank’s current head of comms, Andrea Williams, said in a memo announcing DuVally’s retirement that “Maeve has been an important contributor to the firm’s LGBTQ+ activities, including client events and recruiting.”
She managed some tricky stories during the financial crisis, when the bank faced a deluge of criticism for its handling of mortgage-backed securities. “Maeve has worked on some of the most challenging stories about Goldman Sachs with a focus on protecting the firm’s reputation,” Williams wrote. DuVally joined Goldman Sachs in 2004 from Merrill Lynch and became a managing director in 2010.

DeFi’s control issues
Crypto developers working in decentralized finance, or DeFi, say that their automated platforms are governed by code, not people. But their premise of hands-off decentralization is being challenged by regulators, tech experts and aggrieved investors, most recently in a proposed class action lawsuit filed in New York federal court. The suit alleges that the founders and backers of a leading decentralized exchange, Uniswap, control the protocol and are liable for “rampant fraud.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Are decentralized exchanges actually controlled by insiders? The complaint against Uniswap Labs and the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm and Union Square Ventures accuses the groups of unlawfully selling unregistered securities and leaving investors in the dark about risks that would have to be disclosed on a traditional exchange. “They will argue there is no person behind Uniswap and that it’s decentralized,” James Serritella, the plaintiff’s attorney, told DealBook. But people write the code that controls the exchange’s operations, and its governance system is designed to favor insiders, he argued.
Regulators have signaled their interest in this issue, with the S.E.C. chair Gary Gensler suggesting that DeFi platforms are not immune from oversight. The agency is reportedly investigating Uniswap, but Serritella said that lawyers must “bring these issues to the courts” because enforcers move slowly and investors are getting hurt. “These allegations are meritless and the complaint is riddled with factual inaccuracies,” a Uniswap Labs spokeswoman said in a statement to DealBook. “We plan to vigorously defend against this suit.” Paradigm and Union Square Ventures did not immediately respond to a request for comment; Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment.

If no one controls a program, no one is responsible if things go awry. A group of global market regulators recently studied DeFi services and concluded that they mostly “replicate more traditional financial services and activities, but with weaker regulation and increased risks for investors.” This “casts doubt on a key claim of DeFi innovators that it is a peer-to-peer marketplace with no centralized insiders in control,” the regulators found. That’s akin to the complaints made by Jack Dorsey, the Bitcoin enthusiast who co-founded Twitter and now runs Block (formerly Square), who has been sparring online with Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz.

2022-04-14,"Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter at a valuation of about $43 billion. Here is what will — or could — happen next:
The board reviews the offer. The board will work with its advisers at Goldman Sachs to review Mr. Musk’s offer. They will have to consider, among other things, whether the deal fairly values the company, and whether Mr. Musk has the financing to cobble together a deal.
The board cannot simply decide it does not like Mr. Musk as a suitor, but they can “come up with reasons why they don’t like the bid,” like, for example, his ability to fund it, said Steven Davidoff Solomon, a professor at the School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The board announces its decision. The board will likely take up to a few days to review the offer. If it rejects the offer, it can go in one of several ways: It can put in a defense mechanism known as a poison pill that limits the ability of Mr. Musk, and every other shareholder, to buy up Twitter shares in the open market.
Once it does that, it could still decide to sell itself, but without the pressure of Mr. Musk — or any other suitor — threatening to acquire it by buying a significant number of shares in the open market.
There are reasons Twitter may opt not to do a poison pill. It might be wary of potential criticism that a poison pill is deflecting the concerns of a highly vocal member of its community.
Likewise, Mr. Musk, whose last reported stake in Twitter was a little over 9 percent, has incentive to keep his proportion of Twitter shares below 10 percent. Once he hits that threshold, he is limited in how quickly he can sell out of the company.
Assuming Twitter rejects the offer, Mr. Musk could raise his offer — despite having already said it was best and final. He could also take the bid directly to other shareholders, through what is known as a tender offer, in which he would buy shares from other shareholders.
Still, at least one shareholder has already said the bid undervalues the company.
The board potentially looks for a white knight. “Twitter has essentially been for sale since they went public,” said Howard Berkenblit, who leads the Capital Markets group at law firm Sullivan & Worcester.
Mr. Musk’s latest activity most likely heightened interest in and Twitter’s amenability to a deal. Some private equity firms may be put off by Twitter’s limited cash flow, but a number of technology companies may take a look, given heightened interest in the social media giant’s power and reach.
There could be big suitors. Recall that Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, and Oracle both vied for a deal with video sharing company TikTok. Still, potential antitrust considerations would likely be a significant deterrent, given the Biden administration’s scrutiny of big technology deals."
2022-04-15,"Early this year, I opened my mail to find an intriguing offer: A company wanted to buy stock that I held.
I noted the proposal — $14.40 per share in cash — and searched online for the current price, which was almost $20. Reading further, I saw that the offering document disclosed that the price was about 27 percent less than the stock’s market price.
Why would anyone sell shares at a discount?
Welcome to the strange world of “mini-tender” offers.
Unlike traditional tender offers, which are typically higher than the stock’s price to encourage holders to sell, mini-tenders are usually made for a price that’s less than the stock’s market value.
Why? The goal of the buyers is to purchase shares at a discount, usually so they can make a bigger profit when they sell the shares, said Brian V. Breheny, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Washington and an authority on mergers and acquisitions.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“I’m at a loss as to why people respond” to such offers, he said. Some people simply may not read the offer document, he said, and assume the offer is a good deal.
Bidders “frequently use mini-tender offers to catch shareholders off guard,” the Securities and Exchange Commission says in an online investor tipsheet, and “count on investors jumping to the conclusion” that the price offered includes a premium to the market price, as in a traditional tender offer. (A tender offer means the bidder is asking shareholders to “tender” their shares, or offer them for sale.)
The offers generally fly below the regulatory radar because the buyers are seeking to amass less — often, far less — than 5 percent of a company’s shares, even after completion of the tender offer. That’s intentional. According to the S.E.C., bidders limit the offer “so that they do not have to comply with many of the investor protections” in place for larger offers. Those protections include requiring bidders to file offering documents with the S.E.C. and disclose detailed information about themselves.
The only rules that apply to mini-tenders, according to the S.E.C., require that bidders “not engage in fraud or deceptive practices,” that they hold the offer open for minimum periods of time and that they make “prompt payment” to investors after the offer closes.
More than two decades ago, concerned that such offers were misleading to investors, the S.E.C. took enforcement action against some bidders and issued guidelines for mini-tender offers. As a result, bidders now typically disclose to shareholders if the offer is a discount to the market price. And while the bidders aren’t required to notify target companies, the rules “encourage” them to, so the companies can advise shareholders about the offer, according to the S.E.C.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It’s not clear if such offers are increasing. The S.E.C. says that because mini-tenders don’t have to be filed with the agency, it doesn’t have statistics. But numerous companies have issued statements over the past year, cautioning shareholders about such offers.
The offer I received, from a company called Obatan, was sent to investors of Manulife, a Canadian financial services company. (I generally stick to mutual funds and don’t invest in individual stocks, but I had inherited fewer than 200 shares of Manulife from my mother.)
Manulife issued a news release on Feb. 3 cautioning investors that the company “is in no way associated with Obatan and does not recommend or endorse acceptance of this unsolicited offer.”
The offer included an address for Obatan in Glendale, Calif., but few other details about the company. Peter F. Lindborg, who identified himself as company secretary and outside counsel to Obatan, said in an email that the company had targeted Manulife because it had a large retail investor base, and he framed the offer as a way for shareholders to sell stock with less hassle.
“The strategy is to provide retail shareholders with a convenient way to sell their shares when they do not have a stockbroker,” he said. Even setting up an online trading account, he said, involves filling out a form and verifying your identity.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“It is a matter of choice,” Mr. Lindborg said. “You can buy your groceries at the corner store or you can travel to the supermarket, where prices are lower.”
The offer is open for a long period, he said, so investors “do not feel pressured to act immediately.” They are also advised that they can sell their shares on the open market through a broker at the market price, he said, and can withdraw any shares they tender up until the offer’s expiration date.
Another company, Tutanota, has made a spate of mini-tender offers since last summer, soliciting shareholders of companies including PayPal, Adobe, Disney, Microsoft, Alibaba and Bank of America.
Its offer for PayPal was $125 per share — as long as the stock was trading above that price on the last day of the offer period. The offer also noted that Tutanota expected to extend the offer several times, “until the market price exceeds the offer price,” and that the offer was dependent on Tutanota’s “obtaining all financing necessary” to fund it.
PayPal, whose stock closed at $102 on Thursday, advised shareholders in a Feb. 25 statement to reject the offer. “PayPal does not endorse Tutanota’s unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not affiliated or associated in any way with Tutanota, its mini-tender offer or its mini-tender offer documents,” it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Tutanota, which describes itself as “a private investment company that specializes in investing in publicly traded securities whose value it expects to appreciate over a 12-month period,” couldn’t be reached for comment. No one responded to an email address provided in the offer, or to messages left at a phone number that was answered by a recording.
(A spokeswoman for Tutao, a German company that provides a secure email service called Tutanota, said in an email that it had “no affiliation with Tutanota L.L.C. whatsoever.”)
Companies can be in an awkward position when shareholders receive mini-tender offers. According to the S.E.C., companies must notify their shareholders of tender offers once they become aware of them. But because bidders in mini-tender offers aren’t required to notify the target, the companies may not know about them.
Here are some questions and answers about mini-tender offers:
How do I tell if an offer is a mini-tender?
Bidders generally don’t label their offers as mini-tenders, perhaps because of their dubious reputation. The S.E.C. advises reading the offering document carefully and checking with the bidder or your broker or financial adviser, if you have one. If the bidder is seeking less than 5 percent of the company’s shares, the S.E.C. says, “you’re dealing with a mini-tender offer, and you should proceed with caution.”
What if I have questions about the offer?
The offer will typically have a number to contact a representative of the bidder, but you may not always get more details than are included in the offering document. If you don’t find any statements online from the target company, you can try calling its investor relations office to inquire if it knows about the offer.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
What should I do if I get a mini-tender offer?
Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner in Washington and an “ambassador” for the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, recommends comparing the current market price with the price in the offer and consulting a trusted adviser before taking action.
“I have never advised clients to take advantage of a mini-tender offer,” she said. “They are generally not the best deal for investors.”
Always check alternatives for selling your securities, the S.E.C. advises. Compare the mini-tender offer with how much you would receive if you sold through a broker.
Dennis O. Garris, a partner with Alston & Bird and a former head of the S.E.C.’s office of mergers and acquisitions (and author of the agency’s mini-tender guidance), was blunt. “Throw it away,” he said, “and call the S.E.C. and complain.”
You can submit a complaint to the S.E.C. online or call the agency’s investor assistance line at 800-732-0330."

And now, a word from your streaming sponsor…
Later today, Netflix will report its latest quarterly earnings. Analysts do not have high expectations. The streaming service’s profits are expected to drop by more than 20 percent.
In January, Netflix surprised investors when it said that its growth, which accelerated during the pandemic, was set to slow dramatically. The Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler wrote in a note to clients yesterday that Netflix was facing a number of challenges, including higher content costs, increased competition and the possibility that the U.S. has hit its streaming-subscription saturation point. This is not just a problem for Netflix.
Streaming video services have been struggling to sign up new subscribers. To reach more people, including those grappling with rising inflation and subscription overload, some streamers are offering a deal: They will lower prices in exchange for showing ads amid their programming, The Times’s John Koblin and Tiffany Hsu report.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Netflix and other streamers once shunned ads, but that stance is now in flux:
Netflix is no longer dismissing the possibility of a lower-price, ad-supported option. “Never say never,” Spencer Neumann, Netflix’s C.F.O., said last month.
Disney+ will begin offering an ad-supported subscription, for a reduced fee, this year.
HBO Max began showing ads on its service last summer and said it had not lost premium subscriptions to the ad-supported alternative.
Amazon doubled down on its free, advertising-supported streaming service last week, renaming it Freevee, from IMDb TV, and expanding its programming budget.
Other streamers, like Hulu, Paramount+ and Peacock, have been offering ad-supported services for a while.
Consumers “need advertising-supported models so that they can balance their bank accounts,” said Kelly Metz of Omnicom Media Group. “There’s a ceiling on what the U.S. consumer can practically afford, just like what we saw back in the day with cable television.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Apollo is considering joining a bid for Twitter. The private equity firm may offer debt financing to potential buyers, including Elon Musk, who is locked in a battle with Twitter’s board over his $40 billion-plus bid. Meanwhile, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and former C.E.O., criticized “dysfunction” on the company’s board, where he remains a member.
Amazon will audit its workplace practices for racial bias. The e-commerce giant, under pressure from shareholders, said it hired Loretta Lynch, the former U.S. attorney general, to lead the audit. This comes as a judge ordered Amazon to rehire Gerald Bryson, whom it fired two years ago after he protested safety conditions at a warehouse in Staten Island, the same one that recently voted to unionize.
Mask mandates are falling. The largest airlines and Amtrak dropped mask requirements yesterday after a federal judge in Florida struck down a mandate on public transport, a ruling the Biden administration may appeal. Today, Uber also dropped its mask requirement, but said riders can cancel trips if they feel uncomfortable.
The outlook for the global economy dims. The World Bank yesterday said the global economy would grow 3.2 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 4.1 percent. (The I.M.F. will update its forecasts later this morning.) Meanwhile, China announced a series of measures to boost economic growth, after data showed a significant drop in consumer spending amid pandemic lockdowns.
A biotech firm’s stock plunges amid doubts about its Alzheimer’s drug. Nine health experts told The Times they questioned the scientific underpinnings of Cassava Sciences’ trials for simufilam, a treatment the company claimed had improved cognition in Alzheimer’s patients. Studies of the drug by two scientists, one of whom is employed by Cassava, were flagged by journals as potentially problematic.

Tesla claims to be caught in an agency turf war
The electric vehicle maker Tesla yesterday challenged an investigation into alleged racial discrimination at its factory in California. It argued that the state’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing is “exceeding its boundaries” to advance a turf war with federal authorities. Tesla’s lawyers asked a California court to stay the state’s case against the company.

Tesla’s action comes at a trying time for California’s anti-discrimination agency. The D.F.E.H. is reeling from the recent departure of two top lawyers amid disagreements over its gender discrimination case against the video game company Activision Blizzard, which is expected to merge with Microsoft in a $70 billion deal. The agency’s chief counsel, Janette Wipper, was terminated late last month — unjustly, she argues — and the assistant chief counsel, Melanie Proctor, resigned last week, accusing Gov. Gavin Newsom of California of trying to interfere with the case on behalf of the company. The termination came shortly after Activision Blizzard settled a case with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a deal that D.F.E.H. unsuccessfully tried to stay as its own claims were pending.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The state’s authorities have been sparring with their federal counterparts, and Tesla said it is caught in the crossfire. The company’s lawyers argue that D.F.E.H. is skipping procedural steps and rushing to file lawsuits against companies to grab power from the E.E.O.C. They accused the state agency of “abruptly” advancing its investigation in January “shortly after the federal court in the Activision Blizzard matter issued its order rebuking D.F.E.H. and denying its motion to intervene.” Tesla’s lawyers also said that the California agency demanded that the company “agree to a gag order” and tried to stop it from negotiating a settlement with the E.E.O.C. or others.
Will the Activision Blizzard mess taint the California agency’s credibility in its case against Tesla? Kevin Kish, the director of the D.F.E.H., declined to comment on internal personnel matters, writing in a statement to DealBook: “In recent years, under this administration and my leadership, D.F.E.H. has litigated groundbreaking cases that are a model of effective government enforcement of civil rights.

Businesses resist merger rule rewrite
Antitrust regulators began the year by announcing plans to rewrite merger guidelines — and now businesses are pushing back.
DealBook got a first look at a letter to the F.T.C. and Justice Department being filed today by more than a dozen trade associations, including the Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In response to the government’s request for comment on a potential rethink of merger enforcement, the trade groups argue that a sweeping rewrite would be “misguided.”

“Mergers are a vital part of our economy,” said Sean Heather of the Chamber’s antitrust division. “The government should not inject uncertainty into merger reviews or make mergers unduly difficult. Doing so would harm consumers and American competitiveness.” Nearly 4,500 other commenters have weighed in so far, and many take the opposite view, in part because progressive activists have been rallying the public in favor of tougher antitrust enforcement.
“Abandon an unconstrained approach to merger law,” the trade groups wrote. They said that the agencies’ plans are based on false assumptions about overconcentration. The trade groups cite a 2020 report from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers rejecting research that found business to be too consolidated. But that was a different administration with a very different take on the data.

Billie Jean King invests in women
High-profile backers are starting a new incubator to support start-ups focused on women in sports, DealBook is first to report. The Trailblazer Venture studio, by R/GA Ventures, the venture capital firm Elysian Park, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Billie Jean King Enterprises, comes as female athletes and women’s leagues are seeing an influx of investment, although this still pales in comparison with men’s sports. “There is starting to become that tipping point that I’ve been praying for forever,” Billie Jean King told DealBook.

King has been fighting for equality — and funds — for a long time. “The one thing I learned at a very young age,” the tennis star and social activist said, is “if I want any of these things to happen, it’s going to take money.” She saw firsthand the lack of resources and attention that women got compared with men in sports. “The reason people get very excited about men’s sports is that they’re constantly seeing them, they’re constantly hearing about them, they know their stories,” King said. “The only way you really are powerful is when people know who you are.”
How the new venture works: Trailblazer is a three-month program with four to six start-ups. Investments can range from $200,000 to $2 million. Elysian Park will be the main investor, R/GA will offer its branding expertise and King’s company will offer its relationships. “Everybody needs help and access to things that can really scale and make a difference,” said Ilana Kloss, the C.E.O. of Billie Jean King Enterprises. It’s not enough to say, “if you’re good enough, you’re going to make it,” she said.
Start-ups in the program range in focus from health to nutrition to fandom. “It’s not necessarily ‘By women, for women,’” said Fielding Jamieson of R/GA, who will run the Trailblazer Venture studio. “It’s more, ‘Let me just build a product that is equal across both male and female.’”

2022-04-20,"Employees at an Apple store in Atlanta filed a petition on Wednesday to hold a union election. If successful, the workers could form the first union at an Apple retail store in the United States.
The move continues a recent trend of service-sector unionization in which unions have won elections at Starbucks, Amazon and REI locations.
The workers are hoping to join the Communications Workers of America, which represents workers at companies like AT&T Mobility and Verizon, and has made a concerted push into the tech sector in recent years.
The union says that about 100 workers at the store — at Cumberland Mall, in northwest Atlanta — are eligible to vote, including salespeople and repair technicians, and that over 70 percent of them have signed authorization cards indicating their support.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In a statement, the union said Apple, like other tech employers, had effectively created a tiered work force that denied retail workers the pay, benefits and respect that workers earned at its corporate offices.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Workers said they loved working at Apple but sometimes felt they were treated like second-class employees. “We want equal to what corporate actually gets,” said Sydney Rhodes, an employee at the store who is involved in the union campaign.
Ms. Rhodes, who has worked at Apple for four years, said that she and many of her co-workers hoped to continue working for Apple for years to come but that it was often unclear how they could progress within the company. “Another reason why we're working toward this union is for a more clear and concise way to grow, especially internally,” she added.
An Apple spokesman said the company offered strong benefits, including health care coverage, tuition reimbursement and paid family leave, and a minimum pay rate of $20 per hour for retail workers.
“We are fortunate to have incredible retail team members, and we deeply value everything they bring to Apple,” the spokesman said, but declined to comment on the union effort. The company would not say whether it would recognize the union voluntarily.

Officials at the National Labor Relations Board will next determine whether there is sufficient interest among workers to hold an election — the bar is officially 30 percent — and set the terms for a potential vote. Both the union and the employer will have an opportunity to weigh in on the details, including the universe of employees eligible to take part and whether the vote should occur by mail or in person.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Other unions, most notably Workers United, an affiliate of the giant Service Employees International Union that has led the organizing campaign at Starbucks, are also seeking to unionize Apple retail workers, of which there are tens of thousands in the United States.
Workers at an Apple Store at Grand Central Terminal in New York City have begun to sign authorization cards that could lead to a filing for a union vote that would allow them to join Workers United. The move was reported over the weekend by The Washington Post.
Activism and labor organizing at Apple have been building since last summer, when discontent over the company’s plan to require employees to return to the office snowballed into a broader movement, called #AppleToo. That movement aimed to highlight workplace problems like harassment, unequal pay and what workers described as a culture of secrecy that pervaded the company.
“Apple workers across every line of business and around the world are using their voices to demand better treatment,” Janneke Parrish, one of the #AppleToo leaders, said of the union effort. Ms. Parrish has said Apple fired her in retaliation for her organizing. “I’m so happy to see workers taking this big step to stand up for their rights,” she said. Apple has disputed Ms. Parrish’s accusations.

The #AppleToo movement included retail workers, who have said throughout the pandemic that Apple did not do enough to keep them safe from the coronavirus.
Retail workers’ complaints escalated late last year when the Omicron variant spread rapidly throughout the country and at least 20 Apple stores had to close temporarily as a precaution or because so many of their workers had become infected that the stores could no longer operate. On Christmas Eve, several dozen Apple workers walked off their jobs to demand better pay and working conditions.
Ms. Rhodes said that the effort at her store began in earnest last fall, and that her co-workers had taken encouragement from the union campaigns at companies like Starbucks and Amazon.
Beyond its overtures at Apple, the communications workers union has had a presence at Google in recent years, helping workers form a so-called solidarity or minority union that enables them to coordinate actions without holding a union election and seeking certification from the labor board. Companies are not required to bargain with minority unions, as they are with more formal unions.
The union also recently won a vote to represent about one dozen retail employees at Google Fiber stores in Kansas City, Mo., who are formally employed by a Google contractor. It is seeking to represent a few dozen Wisconsin-based quality assurance workers at the video-game maker Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is acquiring, pending approval from regulators."

2022-04-22,"In just the last few years, Europe has seen a sweeping law for online privacy take effect, approved far-reaching regulations to curb the dominance of the tech giants and on Saturday reached a deal on new legislation to protect its citizens from harmful online content.
For those keeping score, that’s Europe: three. United States: zero.
The United States may be the birthplace of the iPhone and the most widely used search engine and social network, and it could also bring the world into the so-called metaverse. But global leadership on tech regulations is taking place more than 3,000 miles from Washington, by European leaders representing 27 nations with 24 languages, who have nonetheless been able to agree on basic online protections for their 450 million or so citizens.
In the United States, Congress has not passed a single piece of comprehensive regulation to protect internet consumers and to rein in the power of its technology giants.
It’s not for lack of trying. Over 25 years, dozens of federal privacy bills have been proposed and then ultimately dropped without bipartisan support. With every major hack of a bank or retailer, lawmakers have introduced data breach and security bills, all of which have withered on the vine. A flurry of speech bills have sunk into the quicksand of partisan disagreements over freedoms of expression. And antitrust bills to curtail the power of Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, have sat in limbo amid fierce lobbying opposition.

Only two narrow federal tech laws have been enacted — one for children’s privacy and the other for ridding sites of sex-trafficking content — in the past 25 years.
“Inertia is too kind of a word to describe what’s happened in the United States; there’s been a lack of will, courage and understanding of the problem and technologies,” said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a public interest group. “And consumers are left with no protections here and lots of confusion.”

Callaghan O'Hare for The New York Times
The prospects that any legislation will pass imminently are dim, though regulations at some point are almost inevitable because of the way tech touches so many aspects of life. Of all the proposals currently in front of Congress, an antitrust bill that would bar Apple, Alphabet and Amazon from boosting their own products on their marketplaces and app stores over those of their rivals has the best shot.
A co-author of the bill, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said Democratic leaders had promised it would go to a vote by this summer. But even that bill, with bipartisan support, faces an uphill climb amid so many other priorities in Congress and a fierce tech lobbying effort to defeat it.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
If history is a guide, the path toward U.S. tech regulation will be long. It took decades of public anger to regulate the railroads through the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. It took nearly 50 years from the first medical reports on the dangers of cigarettes to the regulation of tobacco.
There’s no single reason for the sludge of progress in Congress. Proposals have been caught in the age-old partisan divide over how to protect consumers while also encouraging the growth of business. Then there are the hundreds of tech lobbyists who block legislation that could dampen their profits. Lawmakers have also at times failed to grasp the technologies they are trying to regulate, turning their public foibles over tech into internet memes.
Tech companies have taken advantage of that knowledge blind spot, said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
“It’s what I call the ‘big con,’ where the tech companies spin a story that they are doing magic and that if Washington touches their companies with regulations they’ll be responsible for breaking that magic,” he said.
In the vacuum of federal regulations, states have created a patchwork of tech rules instead. California, Virginia, Utah and Colorado have adopted their own privacy laws. Florida and Texas have passed social media laws aimed at punishing internet platforms for censoring conservative views.

Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft said they supported federal regulations. But when pressed, some of them have fought for the most permissive versions of the laws that have been under consideration. Meta, for instance, has pushed for weaker federal privacy legislation that would override stronger laws in the states.
Tech’s lobbying power is now on full display in Washington with the threat of the antitrust bill from Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican of Iowa. The proposal passed its first hurdle of votes in January, much to the tech industry’s surprise.

In response, many of the tech companies mobilized an extensive lobbying and marketing campaign to defeat the bill. Through a trade group, Amazon claimed in television and newspaper ads that the bill would effectively end its Prime membership program. Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, wrote in a blog post that the legislation would “break” popular products and prevent the company from displaying Google maps in search results.
Ms. Klobuchar said the companies’ claims were hyperbole. She warned that by fighting the proposal, tech companies might be choosing the worse of two difficult options.

“They are letting Europe set the agenda on internet regulation,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “At least we listened to everyone’s concerns and modified our bill.”
The inaction may appear surprising given that Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly in lock step over how tech companies have morphed into global powerhouses.
“Consumers need confidence that their data is being protected, and businesses need to know they can keep innovating while complying with a strong, workable national privacy standard,” said Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi. “The U.S. cannot afford to cede leadership on this issue.”
Lawmakers have also forced many tech chief executives — including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta — to testify multiple times before Congress in recent years. In some of those televised hearings, lawmakers of both parties have told the executives that their companies — with a combined $6.4 trillion in market value — aren’t above government or public accountability.
“Some of these companies are countries, not companies,” Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said in a January antitrust hearing, adding that they are “killing fields for the truth.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But so far, the talk has not translated into new laws. The path to privacy regulations provides the clearest case study on that record of inaction.
Since 1995, Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced a dozen privacy bills for internet service providers, drones and third-party data brokers. In 2018, the year Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation took effect, he proposed a bill to require a consumer’s permission to share or sell data.
Mr. Markey also tried twice to update and strengthen privacy legislation for youths following his 1998 law, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
With every effort, industry lobbying groups have denounced the bills as harmful to innovation. Many Republican lawmakers have opposed the proposals, saying they don’t balance the needs of businesses.
“Big Tech sees data as dollar signs, so for decades they’ve bankrolled industry lobbyists to help them evade accountability,” Mr. Markey said. “We’ve reached a breaking point.”"

What’s Up? (April 17-23)
A Bad Week for CNN+ and Netflix
After pouring tens of millions of dollars into a nationwide marketing campaign, big-name stars and hundreds of new employees, CNN announced Thursday it was shutting down CNN+, its weeks-old streaming platform. Executives at Discovery, CNN’s new owner, were said to be concerned about underwhelming interest from subscribers. The news fueled questions — particularly after Netflix’s disastrous earnings report last week — about the longer-term outlook for streaming services. Netflix said on Tuesday that it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter and expected some two million more to leave the platform over the next three months. It was the first time in a decade the company lost subscribers, and its shares plunged 35 percent.
Florida Takes On the Magic Kingdom
Escalating its tangle with Disney World, Florida lawmakers advanced a measure to strip the theme park of a privilege that has allowed it to effectively self-govern its vast property in the state for more than 50 years. Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers of the legislature, were spurred on by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who cleared a path for the lawmakers to vote on bills that would eliminate special tax districts created before 1968. He signed the legislation on Friday. The move is widely seen as retaliation for Disney’s opposition to what some call the “Don’t Say Gay” law, which limits instruction on gender and sexuality in some elementary school grades.
Masks Drop on Public Transportation
Many of the country’s major airlines dropped their mask mandates after a federal judge appointed during the Trump administration struck down the requirement for airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation. Airlines including American, Delta and United, which have had to deal with unruly passengers who refused to comply with the mandate, swiftly announced they were no longer requiring masks, and Delta later said it would allow people who were placed on its no-fly list for defying its previous mask policy to fly once again.  The Biden administration said it would appeal the ruling.

What’s Next? (April 24-30)
An Economic Slowdown
The gross domestic product report for the first quarter, which will be released on Thursday, is expected to show that economic growth in the United States slowed significantly in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is partly because of the Omicron wave, which kept many Americans at home in January and disrupted service industries and manufacturing. The report will also help show to what extent inflation — which reached 8.5 percent last month — may be holding back consumers as well as the broader economy. The G.D.P. data from the last quarter of 2021 illustrated how inflation can obscure how much of the country’s economy is recovering from the depths of the pandemic. Output in the United States still had not caught up to prepandemic levels, last quarter’s report showed, because consumers’ dollars are worth less than before.

Elon Musk’s Money Moves
Twitter is releasing its quarterly earnings report this week, and a significant part will probably deal with Elon Musk’s determined efforts to acquire the company and give investors an idea about whether his offer is sufficient. In an attempt to make the company’s board take his offer more seriously, Mr. Musk said on Thursday in a federal filing that he had commitments worth $46.5 billion — a mix of debt and cash — to finance his bid.  The documents also showed that Mr. Musk was considering a hostile takeover, which would involve bringing the bid directly to shareholders. Twitter’s board has already made provisions to thwart such a move, adopting a so-called poison pill that would block Mr. Musk from buying an unlimited number of Twitter shares.
A Big Bet on Gaming
Activision Blizzard shareholders will vote Thursday on whether to merge with Microsoft. For Microsoft, which announced in January that it wanted to acquire the video game company for almost $70 billion, the deal would serve at least two major purposes: In the long term, it plants a flag in the metaverse, the virtual world where tech companies like Facebook are placing big bets.  In the shorter term, the acquisition helps Microsoft get ahead of its rival Sony in the race for gamers’ attention and dollars and keeps the company competitive with Amazon and Google, which have also entered the gaming market. If Activision shareholders approve the deal — and they are likely to do so — it still faces the scrutiny of antitrust regulators.

Stocks slid on Tuesday, adding to a losing streak that has April shaping up to be Wall Street’s worst month in two years.
The S&P 500 fell 2.8 percent, bringing its losses for the month to 7.8 percent. The index is on track for its worst monthly decline since March 2020, when stocks plunged 12.5 percent as the coronavirus spread around the world, prompting lockdowns and halting economic activity.
The steady drop — with only six days of gains in April — has come as investors have confronted a long list of fears: that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates far more quickly than economists had anticipated; that rising prices and wages could erode corporate profits; and that renewed lockdowns in China could become another drag on the global economy.
Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund projected global growth would slow this year to 3.6 percent, from 6.1 percent in 2021. That was before a new Covid outbreak in Beijing raised concerns about more restrictions in China, the world’s second-largest economy, where cities like Shanghai have already been under lockdown for weeks.

He has pledged $21 billion in cash as part of the deal, in addition to loans. Tesla’s shares are often more volatile than those of other large companies, and they can weigh on the broader S&P 500 when they fall because of the company’s huge valuation.

Concerns over an economic slowdown in the United States and abroad have weighed on investors’ minds all month. Already, companies and consumers have borne higher costs for goods and transportation, with inflation reaching 8.5 percent in the year through March.
But the conflict in Ukraine and the shutdowns in China have also triggered volatility in energy markets, with crude oil surging in early March before retreating slightly in April. That has spilled over into the stock market, too.
“There’s been a pendulum going back and forth,” said Ms. Greene. “We go from saying oil prices are too high to saying we’re going to see oil prices come down because we don’t have the demand we thought we would see.”

Investors are also contending with the Fed’s approach toward raising interest rates in the coming months in efforts to cool down inflation. Although Wall Street was already pricing in several rate increases this year, Fed officials have adopted a more aggressive tone this month about their willingness to raise rates quickly to try and stem inflation, and analysts are worried that the central bank could tip the economy into a recession.
“The only way to cool off inflation will be to destroy demand and raise unemployment,” said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute. “It won’t be as simple as raising rates as the markets are expecting.”

The energy war escalates
Russia lashed out at mounting Western arms shipments and economic penalties by cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, signaling a new phase in the war in which oil and gas supplies are a key part of the battleground.
Since the beginning of the conflict, the U.S. and its allies have attempted to punish Russia while avoiding too much damage to countries like Germany, which still depend on Russian oil and gas. As this newsletter noted last month, Russia needs revenue from oil and gas sales to fund its invasion in Ukraine, while its opponents are vulnerable to price spikes and energy shortages.

Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called the gas shut-off “a direct attack.” Poland has been a prime conduit for arms shipments to Ukraine and is sheltering millions of Ukrainian refugees.
Gas prices surged after the cutoff, but the immediate economic impact of the move was limited. Poland has worked for at least a decade to avoid being held ransom by Moscow. Bulgaria, which said Russia was using its gas supplies “as a political and economic weapon,” is more dependent on Russian gas, but it received a pledge of assistance from Greece.
The shut-off serves as a warning of more serious potential gas cutoffs as the war grinds on. It came a day after Germany, which still relies heavily on Russian energy supplies, announced that it would supply its first heavy weapons to Ukraine since the war began.
Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said today that a sudden halt of Russian gas, which accounts for 35 percent of the country’s supplies, would trigger a recession for Europe’s largest economy. He also said Germany is prepared to seize control of a refinery mostly owned by the Russian energy company Rosneft, which could set the stage for a European Union embargo of Russian oil.
This month, the E.U. approved a ban on Russian coal in response to atrocities that Russian troops carried out in the Ukrainian suburb of Bucha. The U.S., Britain and Canada have already stopped importing oil from Russia, the world’s third-largest producer after the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.

Flooding a village to keep Russia at bay
The residents of Demydiv, a village north of Kyiv, have been grappling with the aftermath of a severe flood. And they couldn’t be more pleased.
The Ukrainians flooded the village intentionally, along with a vast expanse of fields and bogs around it, creating a quagmire that thwarted a Russian tank assault on Kyiv and bought Ukraine’s army precious time to prepare defenses, my colleague Andrew E. Kramer reports, with photographs and video by David Guttenfelder.

“Everybody understands and nobody regrets it for a moment,” said Antonina Kostuchenko, a retiree, whose living room is now a musty space with waterlines a foot or so up the walls.
“We saved Kyiv!” she said with pride.
Since the war’s early days, Ukraine has been swift and effective in wreaking havoc on its own territory as a way to foil a Russian army with superior numbers and weaponry.
Demydiv was flooded when troops opened a nearby dam and sent water surging into the countryside. Elsewhere in Ukraine, the military has, without hesitation, blown up bridges, bombed roads and disabled rail lines and airports. The goal has been to slow Russian advances, channel enemy troops into traps and force tank columns onto less favorable terrain.

2022-04-28,"After a year of blistering sales growth, Apple showed that it has a more resilient business than many of its tech peers, even though it cooled off in the first three months of the year.
The company reported on Thursday that profit rose 6 percent to $25 billion in its second fiscal quarter, a slowdown from the double-digit growth in each of the previous five quarters. Sales increased 9 percent to $97.29 billion, exceeding analysts’ expectations, as pandemic-fueled purchases of iPads and Macs slowed from a year earlier.
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, cautioned investors about the months ahead, telling Wall Street analysts that an accelerating Covid outbreak in China will curtail demand and impair production of iPhones, iPads and Macs. He said the supply-chain troubles are expected to reduce sales in the current quarter by $4 billion to $8 billion.
“I think we’re doing a reasonable job currently navigating what is a challenging environment,” Mr. Cook said, noting that “almost all” of the factories Apple relies on in the Shanghai region have restarted production.

The company’s shares fell about 4 percent in after-hours trading, giving up much of Apple’s gains earlier in the day.
The results added to a week of uneven financial reports from leading technology companies that have struggled to sustain last year’s explosive growth. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook’s parent, Meta, had reported profit declines from a year earlier, while Microsoft posted an increase in profit.
The pandemic has been a double-edged sword for Apple. Remote school and work spurred demand for computing equipment, and government stimulus checks and cutbacks in travel and leisure spending provided a jolt to the company’s all-important iPhone business, analysts said. But those same forces sowed supply-chain problems, triggering a global chip shortage that has cost Apple billions of dollars in missed sales.
In addition to highlighting the challenges it faces in China, Apple said total revenue in the current quarter will be crimped by its decision to stop selling products in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. Apple counts on Russia for 1 percent of its sales and a slightly larger percentage of its profit, analysts estimate.
During the January-to-March quarter, sales of iPhones, iPads and other devices rose 6.6 percent to $77.5 billion, Apple said.

The bigger problem for Apple may come in the months ahead as economic strains from the war in Ukraine spill into Europe, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and managing partner at the venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. “People are on edge,” he said. “They’re paying more for fuel. If you live in Germany, does that affect your decision to buy the next iPhone?”
To diversify beyond device sales, Mr. Cook has pushed an increasing array of software and services across Apple products worldwide. Last year, people sequestered at home splurged on apps, video games and subscriptions such as HBO Max. But amid the return to work and school, Apple said, sales growth in its so-called services business slowed, recording $19.82 billion in revenue during the quarter.
The company said it would increase its cash dividend to shareholders by 5 percent and increase its share repurchases by $90 billion."

1. The E.U. is moving closer to a phased embargo of Russian oil.
The embargo has been weeks in the making. Member states are expected to give their final approval by the end of next week, officials and diplomats told The Times.
The oil embargo would be the biggest and most important new step in the E.U.’s sixth package of sanctions since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Russia is Europe’s biggest oil supplier, providing about one-quarter of the bloc’s yearly needs. The E.U. plans to make up the shortfall by increasing imports from other sources, including Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Persian Gulf countries.
Russia appears to be “several days behind” schedule in its offensive on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine — a result of stiff Ukrainian resistance and continuing supply line problems, a senior Pentagon official said.
Ukrainian authorities on Friday published the names and photographs of 10 Russian soldiers they have accused of kidnapping and torturing unarmed civilians in the town of Bucha.

2. Inflation grew 6.6 percent in the last year, the fastest pace since 1982.
Much of the rise was driven by a jump in energy prices linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as rising food costs. After stripping out food and fuel prices, prices climbed by a more muted 5.2 percent in the year through March.
Inflation increased by 0.3 percent in March, slightly slower than its pace the previous month. Consumer spending also remains strong. The report had positive news for workers too: Private sector wages and salaries rose 1.3 percent.
Stock markets deepened their weekly gloom in the wake of the inflation news, with the S&P 500 falling 3.6 percent. The index plunged nearly 9 percent in April, its worst monthly decline since March 2020.

3. A criminal justice bill is in trouble, in a Congress already paralyzed by November’s midterm elections.
The Equal Act, which would end racial disparities in federal prison sentences for different forms of cocaine, easily passed the House, has filibuster-proof bipartisan support in the Senate and the endorsement of President Biden and the Justice Department.
But with the midterms coming and Republicans sharpening a law-and-order message, the measure still might not get its own day in court. Democrats worry that Republicans could demand a series of votes on amendments that could make them look soft on crime and lax on immigration — a sign that Capitol Hill may find it difficult to pass significant legislation this year.

4. Donald Trump seems unlikely to face criminal charges from the Manhattan grand jury that is wrapping up a look at his business practices.
At least three of the potential witnesses central to the case have either not heard from the district attorney’s office in months, or have not been asked to testify, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Other sources with knowledge of the inquiry said a prosecutor who played a key role in the investigation has stopped focusing on a potential case against Trump.
Some people close to the inquiry, which is exploring whether Trump falsely inflated the value of his assets, believe that it will not result in an indictment of the former president unless a new witness unexpectedly cooperates — a long shot in an investigation that has been running for more than three years.

5. An “Oh my God” moment for the mass extinction of sea life.
A new study modeling climate scenarios has concluded that unabated carbon emissions would trigger by 2300 the loss of ocean species on par with Earth’s five mass extinctions. The most recent of those wiped out the dinosaurs.
However, the research came with an important caveat: There is still time to avoid it.
Reining in emissions within the upper limit of the Paris climate agreement would reduce ocean extinction risks by more than 70 percent, researchers found. In that scenario, about 4 percent of ocean species would become extinct by the end of this century.

6. Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter could cause complications in China.
Tesla, Musk’s hugely valuable electric car company, is deeply dependent on China, which is its second-largest market and home to many of its suppliers. And Chinese authorities have shown a willingness to punish companies that cross political red lines.
China has banned Twitter within its borders but has used the social platform extensively to push its own foreign policy around the globe — often using false or misleading information.
Inside Twitter, content moderators warn that Musk doesn’t appear to understand the issues that he will face if he fulfills his promise to remove guardrails around free speech.

7. It was a quiet night for quarterbacks.
The first round of this year’s N.F.L. draft, held last night in Las Vegas, belonged to linemen, receivers and teams trying to maneuver around the draft board.
Two edge rushers — defensive players — went No. 1 and No. 2 overall, with Georgia’s Travon Walker going first to the Jacksonville Jaguars, followed by Michigan’s Aidan Hutchinson to the Detroit Lions.
The night was defined by trades, including a surprising move by the Philadelphia Eagles to acquire wide receiver A.J. Brown from the Tennessee Titans.
As for the spectacle of the draft, our fashion critic wrote that the event may be the last bastion of raw red carpet self-expression.

8. Working 9 to 2, then again after dinner.
For many remote workers, the workday has fragmented. Many are working most of the day with a few short breaks, then adding a third shift during their evenings — what Microsoft researchers call the “third peak” of productivity, following the midmorning and after-lunch crunches.
While these new schedules have enormous upsides for some parents and caregivers, they also create new sources of stress — including the feeling that the workday never ends.
In other return-to-office news, Airbnb told its 6,000 employees that they could work remotely forever. And retailers, eager to tempt a dazed customer base returning to the office, are fully embracing the “power casual” wardrobe.

9. Don’t judge a dog by its breed.
New research based on thousands of owner surveys and genetic studies found that dog breeds are essentially useless for predicting canine behavior. The findings call into question the popular stereotypes of breeds like pit bulls and Labradors.
On average, breed accounts for only about 9 percent of the variations in any given dog’s behavior. And no behaviors are restricted to any one breed, even howling, though the study found that behavior was more strongly associated with breeds like Siberian huskies.
And yet, paradoxically, the study found that many dog behaviors like friendliness are strongly inherited. It’s just that the genes for those behaviors date from long before the 19th century, when most modern breeds were created. Breeding since then has been primarily for physical characteristics.

10. Distressed about your job, climate change or war? Blame this fish.
Internet meme makers have identified a culprit for our modern-day woes: the 375-million-year-old Tiktaalik (pronounced tic-TAH-lick), one of the first vertebrates to move onto dry land.
Think about it: Our modern woes would never have existed if our ancestors had not left the water. The memes yearn to thwack Tiktaalik with a rolled-up newspaper or poke it with a stick — anything to shoo it back into the water and avoid our eventually having to go to work and pay rent.
Alas, we probably can’t trace our family tree directly back to the limbed fish, although the group of fish that moved onto land did give rise to almost half of all modern vertebrates. Furthermore, as one researcher put it: “You don’t hate Tiktaalik,” he said. “You hate capitalism.”
Have a guilt-free night.

2022-04-30,"Berkshire Hathaway, the insurance and investing conglomerate that is run by the billionaire and investment legend Warren E. Buffett, reported on Saturday a significant drop in earnings in the first quarter.
Profits at the company, which owns a diverse array of American brands from the car insurer Geico to the ice cream chain Dairy Queen, fell to $5.4 billion. That was down 53 percent from the nearly $12 billion that it earned in the same three months a year ago. Those profits were also lower than the $6 billion that analysts had expected the company would earn in the quarter.
Much of the drop, though, was driven by Berkshire’s large stock portfolio, which lost nearly $1.6 billion in the first three months of the year, down from a gain of nearly $5 billion in the first quarter of 2021. That drop mirrored the performance of the stock market in general, which had its worst month in two years in April, and has been dragged down by investors’ fears about rising inflation and uncertainty caused by the Ukrainian war and the pandemic’s lingering impact on global supply chains.
The earnings report came out as the company was holding its annual meeting in person for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Mr. Buffett said on Saturday at the meeting that Berkshire had been buying shares of the video game company Activision Blizzard since Microsoft announced its plans to buy Activision on Jan. 18 and now holds a 9.5 percent stake in the company.

The company’s financial filings also showed that Berkshire had dramatically increased its investment in the oil company giant Chevron to nearly $26 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from just $4.5 billion at the end of 2021. That made Chevron Berkshire’s fourth largest holding, behind Apple, Bank of America and American Express. Mr. Buffett has recently been making big bets on the energy sector. Last month, the company also bought $7 billion in shares of Occidental Petroleum.
Sales and profits at Berkshire’s operating businesses continued to rise in the quarter, bucking the overall contraction in the U.S. economy in the first quarter. Economists said, though, that the drop in gross domestic product hid some underlying strength in the U.S. economy, and Berkshire’s operating results seemed to back that up. Profits at Berkshire's manufacturing and retail businesses rose 16 percent from the same period a year ago. Profits at its railroad company Burlington Northern, one of the largest freight networks in the United States, were up 9 percent, again reflecting continued business activity.
Berkshire’s mixed first-quarter results came as tens of thousands of Mr. Buffett’s loyal investors flocked to Omaha, his hometown, for the company’s annual meeting. The Buffett-fest is a daylong folksy affair, often called “Woodstock for Capitalists,” in which Mr. Buffett spends hours answering questions in front of a crowd in the city’s downtown 17,000-seat arena. While there were some empty seats, several corporate notables were there, among them Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, as well as Bill Ackman, the head of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, and the actor Bill Murray.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
A giant conference room floor was filled with booths highlighting Berkshire’s many companies, and offering discounts on things like boxes of See’s Candies, also owned by Berkshire. Mr. Buffett said on Saturday from the stage that See’s had brought 11 tons of candy to the shareholder meeting, and expected to sell out. Only shareholders can attend in person. The meeting has been virtual for the past two years.
Mr. Buffett, in fielding shareholder questions at the meeting, was critical of Wall Street. He said the stock market resembled “a gambling parlor” in recent years, adding that the speculative behavior was “encouraged by Wall Street.”

Mr. Buffett, 91, faces a slightly more contentious annual meeting than usual, despite the fact that Berkshire’s shares, up nearly 8 percent this year, have outperformed the overall market, which is down 13 percent. “Historically, Berkshire shares have outperformed during periods of economic distress as investors made a ‘flight to quality,’” Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who follows Berkshire, wrote in a note to clients this past week.
Dissident shareholders put up a proposal asking Berkshire to overhaul how it views and details its climate risk, something Mr. Buffett has resisted doing. They say Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which manages a number of large utilities, has lagged rivals in setting plans to lower its emissions of carbon dioxide. The climate proposal last year had the support of many larger shareholders outside of Mr. Buffett’s inner circle, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.
What’s more, a number of large investors, including the giant California Public Employees Retirement Fund, backed a shareholder proposal that sought to remove Mr. Buffett, who is currently both chief executive and chairman of the company’s board of directors, from his chair role. That proposal is one that larger investors have floated at other companies as well, arguing that splitting the roles is better corporate governance.
Mr. Buffett opposed the proposals and they failed on Saturday. Because he has a large number of votes, proposals Mr. Buffett opposes are typically defeated.
When responding to the climate proposal on Saturday, he once again emphasized that Berkshire Hathaway Energy was making big investments in renewable energy projects. But those behind the proposal said they wanted Berkshire to make climate disclosures for the whole company, not just parts of the conglomerate. “What we are asking for is a composite picture,” said Timothy Youmans, an executive at EOS at Federated Hermes in North America, which was a sponsor of the climate proposal.

Consumers are bracing for higher prices for gas and other goods.

A rate increase… and then what?
The Federal Reserve is meeting this week. The economy is running hot, and the Fed is trying to slow it down before widespread price pressures become even more of a problem. It lifted interest rates in March for the first time since 2018, by a quarter of a percentage point, and has set the stage for an even larger increase of half a percentage point this week. The announcement is expected to come at the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon.
But while the rate decision is unlikely to be a surprise, economists and investors will want to know how the Fed plans to move forward at a time when inflation is rising faster than it has in decades. The recent performance of the stock market, which in April took its biggest monthly dive in two years, is hinting at economic trouble ahead, and is the latest complication in the Fed’s fight against inflation.
The outlook for inflation is wildly uncertain, report The Times’s Jeanna Smialek and Ben Casselman. On one hand, the Fed’s small rate increase has already pushed mortgage rates sharply higher, which may start to weigh on the housing market and cool off related types of demand. Nonetheless, costs for raw materials and other key inputs continue to climb, and may keep doing so amid the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. Already, some companies, like the washing-machine maker Whirlpool, are seeing consumer demand wane compared with last year, though it is still higher than before the pandemic. “Historic levels of inflation, notably in raw materials, energy and logistics, will impact us throughout the year,” James W. Peters, Whirlpool’s chief financial officer, said last week in a conference call.
Americans have been feeling the pain of higher prices, even if they are spending through it. A record share of people in a Gallup poll named inflation as the top U.S. economic problem, survey data released last week showed. Officials spent much of 2021 hoping that pandemic-era cost increases would fade as supply chains returned to normal. Instead, inflation has remained too high for the Fed’s comfort for a year, and it has become broader with time. A higher-than-expected jump in wage data released Friday made a second big increase in June more likely “at the margin,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
At the same time, the stock market has had a bad year. The Fed has long said it doesn’t make decisions based on the market, but clearly the recent stock rout makes raising interest rates harder. The S&P 500 fell 8.8 percent in April, and is down more than 13 percent in 2022. The drop shows many investors are coming to the same conclusion: The economy is about to take a hit, and everywhere they look, they see trouble ahead, reports The Times’s Coral Murphy Marcos. “There are definitely a lot of open-ended and unquantified risks looming,” said Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm.

Get it with a Times subscription.
In March, at the annual Conference on College Composition and Communication, one panel presentation was of particular interest: It concerned requirements in first-year college composition classes and discussed the idea that for students whose home dialect is Black English, or another nonstandard dialect, requiring them to write in standard English is a potentially unjust, if not flatly racist imposition, forcing some students to suppress their true selves in favor of a hegemonic artificiality. This school of thought holds that writing instructors should allow — encourage — such freshmen to write either purely in their home dialect or to engage in “code-meshing,” mixing the home dialect and the standard.
It’s an approach that accomplishes the feat of both underserving Black English speakers and diminishing Blackness.
During the panel’s Q. and A., an attendee presented this question: “What do we do when the resistance to code-meshing, for example, in our writing classrooms, comes from our BIPOC students? I ask because, of my attempts to encourage students to use their home dialects in writing, Black students in particular often resist those practices as setting them up for failure. Which only reflects how ingrained they are in a system that is inherently racist.”
The question and the panelists’ answers were quite revealing, including one from Asao Inoue, a rhetoric and composition professor at Arizona State University, who responded that when he hears that kind of objection from a student, he asks himself:
Is it that I have to say, or I have to create a classroom, and a learning experience, that demeans the linguistic history of that student in order for that student to go into the world and go into unfair racist, white supremacist systems and succeed? … Because if that student says, “You’re setting me up for failure,” what they’re saying is, “I want to succeed in that unfair system. I want to game that system.”
But, Inoue continued:
You’re always still going to be Black, or you’re always still going to be Latinx, or you’re always still going to be something else. … you can mouth the words that are white, but they’re coming from a body that’s something else, and you may be read that way. And so, for me, my goal as an educator is to change the system.
Because, he said:
What they’ve been exposed to is capitalist-inflected [expletive] about education being the way in which we, you, become a nice little cog in the system and you get skills. So you can go out in the world and make Microsoft more money.
While not all writing professors would go that far, in terms of appending a critique of capitalist reality to teaching freshman composition, just the notion that standard English is exterior to Black students’ real selves requires a closer look, because it tracks with worrisome currents in the way we are encouraged to think about race, especially lately.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Few familiar with today’s academic world will find Inoue’s opinions especially surprising. The idea in education circles that standard English functions as an unjust “gatekeeper,” holding back students of color, has been around for a long time. Related has been the idea that at the grade-school level, Black students whose home dialect is Black English should be taught as bilinguals of a sort. Adherents of this philosophy don’t say standard English should be withheld but suggest that standard English and Black English should be presented as different languages, as it were. Recall the “Ebonics” debate that gained national attention in the 1990s.
In 1993, English Leadership Quarterly, a publication of the National Council of Teachers of English, published a piece by two Indiana University of Pennsylvania English professors, Donald A. McAndrew and C. Mark Hurlbert, arguing that:
Writers should be encouraged to make intentional errors in standard form and usage. Attacking the demand for standard English is the only way to end its oppression of linguistic minorities and learning writers. We believe this frontal assault is necessary for two reasons: (1) it affords experienced writers, who can choose or not choose to write standard English, a chance to publicly demonstrate against its tyranny and (2) if enough writers do it regularly, our culture’s view of what is standard and acceptable may widen just enough to include a more diverse surface representation of language, creating a more equitable distribution not only of the power in language and literacy but also, ultimately, of the power in economics and politics that language and literacy allow.
Later, as The Washington Times reported in 1995, the N.C.T.E. discussed eliminating “English” from its name. That year, a delegate to its annual convention said, “If we are to offer diversity, there can be a conversation about language arts, but not about English.”"
2022-05-04,"John Doerr, one of the most successful venture capitalists in the history of Silicon Valley, is giving $1.1 billion to Stanford University to fund a school focused on climate change and sustainability.
The gift, which Mr. Doerr is making with his wife Ann, is the largest ever to a university for the establishment of a new school, and is the second largest gift to an academic institution, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. Only Michael R. Bloomberg’s 2018 donation of $1.8 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, ranks higher.
The gift establishes the Doerrs as leading funders of climate change research and scholarship, and will place Stanford at the center of public and private efforts to wean the world off fossil fuels.
“Climate and sustainability is going to be the new computer science,” Mr. Doerr, who made his estimated $11.3 billion fortune investing in technology companies such as Slack, Google and Amazon, said in an interview. “This is what the young people want to work on with their lives, for all the right reasons.”
The school, to be known as the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, will be a home to traditional academic departments related to topics such as planetary science, energy technology and food-and-water security. It will also feature several interdisciplinary institutes and a center focused on developing practical policy and technology solutions to the climate crisis.

“The school will absolutely focus on policy issues and on asking what would it take to move the world toward more sustainable practices and better behaviors,” Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the Stanford president, said in an interview.
Mr. Doerr joins a growing list of ultrawealthy men donating huge sums of money to the fight against global warming. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in 2020 said he was committing $10 billion of his own money to a new initiative he called the Bezos Earth Fund, and last year detailed how some of the money would be spent.
Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, said in 2019 he would spend $500 million to help close coal-fired power plants. And Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, has put billions of dollars to work on climate related issues through various efforts, including Breakthrough Energy and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Yet some question whether these philanthropic investments can make a difference when it comes to a planetary crisis.
“I don’t see how giving a billion dollars to a rich university is going to move the needle on this issue in a near-term time frame,” said David Callahan, author of “The Givers: Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age.” “It’s nice that he’s parting with his money, but that billion dollars could be better spent trying to move this up on the scale of public opinion. Until the public sees this as a top tier issue, politicians are not going to act.”
Arun Majumdar, who was named as the school’s inaugural dean and has advised the Obama and Biden administrations on energy issues, said the school would provide context and analysis around climate change issues, but would stop short of advocacy. “We will not go into the political arena,” he said. “That’s a very slippery slope for us.”
Mr. Majumdar, who currently holds a chair at Stanford named for Jay Precourt, a businessman who made his name in the oil business, also said that the new school would work with and accept donations from fossil fuel companies.
“Not all oil and gas industries are on board, but there are some who are who are under pressure to diversify, otherwise they will not survive,” Mr. Majumdar said. “Those that want to diversify and be part of the solutions, and they want to engage with us, we are open to that.”

Mr. Doerr said he was first inspired to address climate change in 2006, after he watched Al Gore’s film, “An Inconvenient Truth,” with his family. He said that, at dinner after the film, his daughter told him, “Your generation created this problem. You better fix it.” The next year, Mr. Gore joined Kleiner Perkins, Mr. Doerr’s venture capital firm.
In the years that followed, Kleiner Perkins made several major investments in clean energy companies and Mr. Doerr delivered a TED Talk titled “Salvation (and Profit) in Greentech.” But during the financial crisis of 2008, when the cost of natural gas plummeted due to fracking, many of those clean energy companies failed.
Last year Mr. Doerr published a book called “Speed & Scale: An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now.” In it, he calls for rapid action to reduce emissions and increase the use of renewable energy. Among his priorities are electrifying transportation, adding massive amounts of clean power to the grid and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production.
“We’ve got to be clear about the problem,” he said. “I believe this is a problem of scale that needs far greater ambition, urgency and excellence deployed against it.”
Mr. Doerr and his wife are signatories to the Giving Pledge, the effort founded by Mr. Gates, his ex-wife Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett to persuade ultrawealthy individuals to give away the majority of their fortunes during their lifetimes or in their wills. “Climate and sustainability is the most important of our causes,” Mr. Doerr said of his family’s philanthropic plans.

Other major universities, including Columbia, are establishing interdisciplinary schools focused on climate change as well. Yet the Doerr School for Sustainability, Stanford’s first new school in 70 years, will be among the largest and best funded. It will launch with 90 faculty members and add 60 more over the next 10 years. The university said it had raised an additional $590 million alongside the gift from the Doerrs, and that some of the funds would be used to construct two new buildings.
Mr. Doerr said he hoped that the gift would inspire other wealthy individuals to spend their fortunes combating climate change. “This is going to take more than one institution,” Mr. Doerr said. “Just like we have multiple medical schools, we need multiple sustainability schools to get the job done.”"

The Fed’s one-two punch
The Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates by a half percentage point and announced a plan to shrink its huge bond holdings in an effort to slow inflation, which is running at its fastest pace in 40 years. It was the central bank’s largest interest rate increase since 2000 — rates usually move by a quarter of a percentage point — and more half-point hikes are “on the table,” the Fed’s chair, Jay Powell, said, adding: “Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The quick pullback signals urgency. By shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet while substantially raising rates, the central bank has charted a course for rapidly withdrawing support from the economy, writes The Times’s Jeanna Smialek. The two moves are likely to ricochet across the economy as money becomes more expensive to borrow. The decision shows that the Fed is intent on cooling down the economy and the job market amid fears that rapid inflation could become permanent. Prices have been rising quickly at worrying rates for months.
The notion of a return to some kind of prepandemic normal without intervention has been abandoned. Policymakers had previously believed that inflation would ease as supply shortages moderated and as the economy evened out after early-pandemic disruptions. Now, new Covid lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine are aggravating inflation and will most likely continue to weigh on economic activity, according to the Federal Open Market Committee statement for May.
Markets took solace in limits to the tinkering. The stock market rallied after Powell announced that the Fed was not “actively considering” more aggressive action. “Market observers over the last week were starting to think that a 75 basis point increase was a possibility,” Emily Bowersock Hill, the chief executive of Bowersock Capital Partners, said, referring to a 0.75 percentage point increase in interest rates. The “euphoria” in the stock market also showed that the Fed didn’t say anything that investors weren’t already expecting, she added. In other words, one less shock is worth a lot right now. U.S. stock futures fell this morning, suggesting the market could give back some gains today.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Shell reports a record $9.1 billion profit. Rising energy prices, along with cost cutting, helped Europe’s largest energy company secure its biggest quarterly profit. Its adjusted earnings were almost triple those in the same period a year earlier.
Stringent coronavirus lockdowns in China are leaving millions out of work. Some of the most important economic centers, factories and businesses have had to close, sometimes for weeks. Migrant workers and recent college graduates have been hit especially hard.
A teachers’ union calls for scrutiny of Meta’s governance. The president of the American Federation of Teachers said the company presented “clear threats” to children. The union urged member pension funds to support a shareholder proposal to seek outside review of the company’s policies.
N.Y.C. employee pension funds sue Activision Blizzard. The groups, which own stock in the video game maker, argue that Activision failed to turn over requested financial records and say the sale to Microsoft for $70 billion undervalues the company.
Intuit will pay $141 million to settle deceptive marketing claims. The company advertised free services then charged hidden fees and “cheated millions of low-income Americans,” said Letitia James, New York’s attorney general. The settlement was signed by the attorneys general of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Musk’s new investors
Elon Musk has brought in a new cohort of investors to help fund his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, according to securities documents filed this morning. Musk has said he is using around $20 billion in equity to assist with his bid along with a $12.5 billion loan against his Tesla shares. As a result of the new investors, Musk is reducing the size of his loan against his Tesla shares to $6.25 billion. Musk is also continuing to talk with certain investors, including Jack Dorsey, about rolling over his stake in Twitter, the filing said.
Here are some names that caught our eye:

Companies’ continued silence on Roe v. Wade
Yesterday, DealBook wrote that many large companies had stayed quiet after a leaked Supreme Court draft ruling showed that Roe v. Wade may be overturned. A few more companies have since weighed in, but most Fortune 500 companies — even those that had spoken up on other social issues — remain silent. (That includes entertainment studios that spoke out against Georgia’s abortion bill in 2019.)

Some companies are pushing others to take a stand. When OkCupid, the dating service, tweeted that overturning Roe v. Wade would be “unacceptable,” it urged followers to, “Tag a brand you want to see take action.” Miriam Warren, Yelp’s chief diversity officer, said that, “the days of companies not wading into political issues, or not speaking out on things that are perceived as private or personal, are over.”
DealBook readers are also weighing in. One reader commented on our story from yesterday: “Corporations, despite what some have said, are not people. They should keep their mouths shut, on both sides of the issue.”
The stakes are high. In September, John Gibson, the chief executive of Tripwire Interactive, a gaming company in Georgia, tweeted that he was “proud” of the Supreme Court for “affirming the Texas law banning abortion for babies with a heartbeat.” He was replaced within days. Pushback goes both ways: In Florida, Disney’s run-in with the governor, Ron DeSantis, underlines the backlash companies can face for publicly criticizing state legislation.
The labor market is a factor. Some executives say restrictive laws have negatively affected recruiting.
Vivek Bhaskaran, the chief executive of QuestionPro, a technology services company that in recent years moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, said the state’s restrictive laws had hampered the company’s ability to recruit talent. “I’ve done tons of interviews, and in almost all of these conversations, we end up talking about the abortion law in one way, shape or form,” he said. “One lady said, ‘My personal values are not really tied to Texas — are you going to force me to move to Texas?’”
Solugen, a Houston-based chemicals company, said it would open a second office in Boston to accommodate recruits who didn’t want to move to Texas.

At Milken, fears of rising corporate debt
The annual Milken Institute Global Conference hosted by the financier Michael Milken concluded yesterday. It drew some 3,500 academics, deal makers, politicians and celebrities this week to the Beverly Hilton, and closed with a Beach Boys concert that included the band’s 1964 hit “Don’t Worry Baby.” Few, though, seemed to be taking the advice. The conference, in which billionaires usually come to exchange outlooks for their portfolios and the economy, had a more downbeat tone than usual.
The Goldman Sachs chief executive, David Solomon, said he was worried about what the Fed’s rate increases would do to markets and the economy. “Facebook broke democracy,” Danielle Allen, a Harvard political theorist, said during a panel discussion on how to heal the political divide in America.
Separately, according to a new report published this morning by Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm, most year-end bonuses on Wall Street are likely to drop because the volume of deals so far this year is significantly down from 2021. The firm also expects hiring to slow as asset managers try to rein in spending. Last year, the average bonus paid to employees in New York City’s securities industries rose to $257,500, which is 20 percent higher than the record high in 2020, according to estimates published in March by New York State.
The big worry at Milken was debt … Corporations have more debt than they did during the financial crisis in 2008. That might cause trouble now that both interest rates and costs are rising.
… and the Federal Reserve. “The Fed is going to go too fast,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. “The economy is going to break.”
“We don’t necessarily anticipate a tsunami of failures as some people do,” Josh Friedman, who is co-founder of the $27 billion hedge fund Canyon Capital, told DealBook. “But the higher interest-rate environment is already causing stress and will continue to do so.”

2022-05-06,"These are rocky times for most investments. But it has been a wonderful stretch for the dollar.
You may not have noticed if you haven’t traveled abroad and exchanged dollars for euros, yen or nearly any other major currency. But many currency traders, S&P 500 company executives and economists certainly have.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against six other important currencies, is hovering at levels it hadn’t reached in 20 years. Since the start of the year, it has gained 8 percent; in the last 12 months, it has risen 14 percent. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar has risen more than 13 percent this year alone.
The Federal Reserve’s latest moves to tighten monetary conditions are likely to spur the dollar further. Fed policymakers decided on Wednesday to raise short-term interest rates half a percentage point and to begin reducing the bonds on its $9 trillion balance sheet in June.
Continuing interest rate increases are likely in the Fed’s efforts to bring down inflation. While rising rates can be expected to make stocks, bonds and mortgage rates more volatile, there’s an excellent chance they will burnish the dollar.

Fundamentally, a flood of foreign money into U.S. businesses and investments has been driving up the value of the dollar.
In fact, a variety of actions that have unsettled the stock and bond markets have worked together to boost the greenback’s value against other currencies. These include the Fed rate increases, Russia’s war in Ukraine, global sanctions on Russia, soaring commodity prices, China’s lockdowns, and Europe’s and Japan’s economic slowdowns.
Against this backdrop of faltering world economies and geopolitical instability, global demand has risen for relatively safe and increasingly higher-yielding assets like Treasurys. The U.S. economy may be in a precarious spot, but compared with other countries, it has recovered well from the pandemic recession, its markets continue to be deep and relatively stable, and the interest rates offered on its government bonds are generous.
The Fed’s commitment to fight inflation by raising interest rates can be expected to push up Treasury yields further. That could make them even more attractive in comparison with the lower-yielding bonds of nations like Germany, Japan and China, which have been easing local monetary conditions, not tightening them. Already, yield discrepancies, or spreads, are wide. These are the yields for 10-year government bonds.
United States, about 3.1 percent.
Germany, about 1.1 percent.
Japan, less than 0.25 percent.
Even yields on Chinese bonds, which had been higher than those in the United States, dropped below Treasurys recently.

The economic impact

A more valuable dollar makes U.S. imports cheaper and exports less competitive on world markets.

Jim Wilson/The New York Times
The rising dollar has had significant effects on the global economy. For one thing, it has contributed to the surging U.S. trade deficit, which hit a new high in March. A more valuable currency makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive and less competitive on world markets.
For another, it reduces inflationary pressures in the United States.
“America is a nation of consumers, and over half of what Americans consume every year is made abroad,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist of his own firm, Rosenberg Research in Toronto, in an interview. “As the dollar goes up, the cost of these imported goods goes down. Those declining costs will be showing up in the Consumer Price Index. We haven’t seen the full brunt of it yet.”
Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said the rising dollar had mitigated some of the inflationary effects in the United States of rising commodities like oil, which are priced in dollars.

“It’s unusual for the dollar to strengthen at the same time as commodity prices are rising” largely because of Russia’s war in Ukraine, she said.
But if the Fed was to decide that the economy was too weak to withstand rising interest rates and “take the foot off the brakes and not tighten monetary policy as fast as everybody thinks,” she said, “then the dollar would weaken and we would still have high inflation in commodities, and we could get stuck in a real stagflation thing.” That, she added, “is why this is a particularly dangerous time for the economy.”
Mr. Rosenberg said that by raising interest rates sharply when the dollar was already helping to pull down inflation, the Fed might be driving the economy into a recession. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference on Wednesday that inflation was too high for the Fed to hold back.
“I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession,” Mr. Powell said.
Headwinds for companies

The rising dollar is making life difficult for many global corporations. On top of supply chain disruptions and inflation, they need to worry about the effect of the rising dollar on their profits. It’s earnings season on Wall Street, and this theme has come up repeatedly.
The dollar is hurting Apple’s revenue this quarter, Luca Maestri, the company’s chief financial officer, told analysts. “With respect to foreign exchange,” he said, “we expect it to be a nearly 300-basis-point headwind to our year-over-year growth rate.” That means a negative 3 percent effect.
In much the same vein, Andre Schulten, chief financial officer for Procter & Gamble, said: “We’ve seen another step in cost pressures, and foreign exchange rates have moved further against us.” Losses from the dollar are likely “to be a $300 million after-tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year,” he said.

These foreign exchange losses carry over to the stock market.
A 2018 study by S&P Dow Jones Indices found that S&P 500 companies with the least dependence on foreign revenue tended to perform well when the dollar was strengthening. That appears to be happening now.
A subindex of the S&P 500 — the S&P 500 U.S. Revenue Exposure Index, filled with domestic-oriented companies like Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth Group, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase — dropped 6.2 percent this year through Thursday. That’s a stupendous return when you compare the index with its more international counterpart, the S&P 500 Foreign Revenue Exposure Index, which lost 15.7 percent. The biggest constituents of the foreign index are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Tesla.
While making substantial, direct bets on the dollar is hazardous, it is possible to do so through exchange-traded funds. The Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bullish Fund, for example, has gained 8.1 percent this year. That compares with losses of 13 percent for the S&P 500 and 11.1 percent for the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, a popular benchmark for bonds.
But before drawing practical conclusions from this comparison, remember that the dollar won’t keep rising forever. In fact, it may make more sense to bet on the opposite direction, Ms. Shalett suggested.
Putting money into companies with international exposure, and investing in markets that have been pummeled, like Japan, may be a good contrarian move if you have a lot of patience and fortitude, she said. Similarly, stocks and bonds in many emerging markets, which have been hit hard by the pandemic and by the war in Ukraine, are becoming attractively priced.
Chinese stocks and bonds may be good opportunities, too. “I suspect that when China emerges from these Covid lockdowns, and its economy really begins to revive, it will pull other emerging market economies with it,” Ms. Shalett said. “That might be when the dollar weakens.”

Or it might not. U.S. Treasury secretaries usually say they favor a strong dollar, even when economic conditions don’t warrant it, as I observed in 2015, during another bout of dollar ascendancy.
Like this one, it occurred largely because monetary policies in the United States were out of sync with those in other major countries. As a side effect, American travelers got a little more for their money, but American exporters suffered.

2022-05-10,"Bill Gates, who has donated millions to pandemic relief efforts, tested positive for the coronavirus, he said on Tuesday.
Mr. Gates, 66, said on Twitter that he was isolating with mild symptoms and that he was vaccinated and boosted. It was not clear if this was the first time he had tested positive for the coronavirus. He also said that he would participate virtually in a meeting on Tuesday with people from his foundation.
In recent months, Mr. Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft and one of the richest men in the world, has focused his considerable resources on the pandemic. He published a book last week called “How to Prevent the Next Pandemic,” in which he explains how countries could pull off a coordinated effort to avert pandemics and “eliminate all respiratory diseases.”
He has been outspoken about how the global health authorities should respond to the pandemic and distribute vaccines. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said it has donated millions to organizations including Gavi and the World Health Organization to fund testing, treatments and vaccine distribution. (The Gateses divorced last year, but both expressed continued commitment to the foundation.)
In January, Mr. Gates said on Twitter that “once Omicron goes through a country,” the virus could be treated “more like seasonal flu.”"
2022-05-11,"WASHINGTON — The confirmation of a third Democrat to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday broke a partisan deadlock at the agency. That’s good news for Lina Khan, the agency’s chair and a Democrat.
It is also a test.
With the F.T.C.’s new Democratic majority — which came with the confirmation of Alvaro Bedoya, who becomes the fifth commissioner, in a slot that had been vacant since October — Ms. Khan’s allies and critics are watching to see if she pushes forward plans to address corporate power. That could include filing an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, setting online privacy rules and tapping little-used agency powers to clip the wings of companies like Meta, Apple and Google.
As Congress remains gridlocked and the midterm elections near, agencies like the F.T.C. and the Department of Justice are likely the best remaining hope for activists and policymakers who want the government to restrain corporate power. President Biden, who has promised to crack down, last year ordered the F.T.C. and other federal agencies to take steps to limit concentration.
Under Ms. Khan, 33, who became the chair in June, the F.T.C. has already tried tamping down mergers by threatening to challenge deals after they close. The commission has said it will punish companies that make it hard for users to repair their products. And it settled a case with the company once known as Weight Watchers over a diet app that collected data from young children.

But Ms. Khan’s new Democratic majority is essential for a broader “realization of her vision,” said William E. Kovacic, a former chair of the F.T.C. “And the clock’s ticking.”
In a statement, Ms. Khan said she was “excited” to work with Mr. Bedoya and the other commissioners. She did not address how the F.T.C.’s new majority would affect her plans.
The F.T.C.’s previous split between two Republicans and two Democrats led to impasses. In February, the commission couldn’t reach an agreement to move forward with a study of the practices of pharmacy benefit managers.
Sarah Miller, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a progressive group that wants more antitrust enforcement, described the F.T.C.’s two Republicans, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, as “libertarian holdouts” who have “kind of thrown the brakes” on Ms. Khan’s ability to advance her agenda.
Mr. Phillips said in an email that he supported the commission’s “long tradition of bipartisan work to advance the interests of American consumers.” But he will not support Ms. Khan’s agenda when it “exceeds our legal authority,” raises prices for consumers or harms innovation, he said.

Ms. Wilson pointed to three speeches she gave over the last year criticizing Ms. Khan’s philosophy. In one speech last month, Ms. Wilson said Ms. Khan and her allies were drawing on tenets from Marxism.

Alvaro Bedoya, a Democrat, was confirmed on Wednesday as the fifth member of the F.T.C.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader, said Wednesday’s vote confirming Mr. Bedoya was “pivotal to unshackling the F.T.C.”
Now Ms. Khan may gain the ability to pursue a legal case against Amazon. She wrote a student law review article in 2017 criticizing the company’s dominance. The F.T.C. began investigating the retail giant under the Trump administration; some state attorneys general have also conducted inquiries into the company.
Ms. Khan could file a lawsuit to challenge Amazon’s recent purchase of the movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. When the $8.5 billion transaction closed in March, an F.T.C. spokeswoman noted that the agency “may challenge a deal at any time if it determines that it violates the law.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ms. Khan may put her stamp on other deals. The agency is examining Microsoft’s $70 billion purchase of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard and sent a request to the companies this year for additional information.
An executive order from Mr. Biden last year encouraging more aggressive antitrust policy pushed the F.T.C. and the Justice Department to update the guidelines they use to approve deals, which could lead to stricter scrutiny. Ms. Khan is likely to need the support of the commission’s two other Democrats, Mr. Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, to approve aggressive new guidelines or to challenge major mergers.
Ms. Khan has also said she wants to bulk up the agency’s powers by considering regulations governing privacy and how algorithms make decisions. She has said that the F.T.C. underutilized its role as a rules-making body and that regulations would enhance its mandate to protect consumers.
“Given that our economy will only continue to further digitize, marketwide rules could help provide clear notice and render enforcement more impactful and efficient,” she said last month at a privacy conference.
The F.T.C. could also act on requests from progressive activist groups that want the agency to ban data-driven advertising business models and forbid noncompete agreements that stop workers from taking a job with a competitor of their current employer.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But former F.T.C. officials said Ms. Khan faced challenges, even with the Democratic majority. The creation of privacy regulations could take years, said Daniel Kaufman, a former deputy head of the agency’s consumer protection bureau. Businesses are likely to challenge rules in court that don’t fit into the F.T.C.’s mandate to protect consumers from deceptive and unfair practices.
“The F.T.C.’s rule-making abilities are not designed to tackle behavioral advertising so I’ve been telling my clients the agency could kick something off with a lot of press but it’s unclear where it will go,” Mr. Kaufman, a partner at the law firm BakerHostetler, said.
Ms. Khan’s efforts are also sure to continue facing opposition from Mr. Phillips and Ms. Wilson. Mr. Phillips has said he has reservations about the agency’s becoming a more muscular regulator. In January, he said Congress, not the F.T.C., should be the one to make new privacy rules.
Ms. Wilson recently posted screenshots of an internal survey showing that satisfaction among the F.T.C.’s career staff has fallen. “New leadership has marginalized and disrespected staff, resulting in a brain drain that will take a generation to fix,” she said.
To overcome their opposition, Ms. Khan will have to keep her majority intact. That gives leverage to Mr. Bedoya, a privacy expert who has focused on the civil rights dangers of new technologies, and Ms. Slaughter, a former top member of Senator Schumer’s staff.

Ms. Slaughter said in a statement that Mr. Bedoya’s privacy expertise would serve the F.T.C. well. She did not comment on the agency’s Democratic majority.

Data delayed at least 15 minutesSource: FactSetBy: Ella Koeze
Stocks fell slightly on Thursday, with the S&P 500 heading for its sixth consecutive weekly decline and inching closer to bear market territory.
Trading was turbulent, and after recovering from a sharp fall the S&P 500 ended just 0.1 percent lower. The index is down 4.7 percent for the week, on track for its biggest weekly decline since at least January. This would also be a sixth weekly drop in a row, Wall Street’s longest stretch of losses since 2011.
The Nasdaq composite was also volatile, and ended the day little changed.
Though Wall Street’s sell-off this year — which comes after the S&P 500 rallied 90 percent in the previous three years — was triggered by concerns about rising inflation and interest rates, and how the combination could hurt the economy, it has taken on a life of its own as investors see every new data point as a cause for concern.
The most recent selling has also hit cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and metals and other raw materials like copper and oil, losses that reflect weakening sentiment across financial markets as well as concern about the global economy.

The drop has left the S&P 500 on the edge of a bear market, Wall Street’s term for a drop of 20 percent or more from its last peak, a label meant to highlight just how dark the mood among investors has become. Through Thursday, the index was down about 18 percent from its Jan. 3 peak. The Nasdaq Composite is well into bear market territory, down 29 percent from its November high.
The drop this week has come along with fresh updates on the pace of inflation in the United States. The Consumer Price Index rose 8.3 percent in the year through April from a year earlier, the government said on Wednesday, while a measure of prices paid to producers rose 11 percent. While both measures showed that inflation cooled slightly from the month before, they remain uncomfortably high.

For stock investors, the inflation data feeds directly into views on how aggressively the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates: Higher borrowing costs will slow growth and also dampen interest in risky investments.

Analysts say the dour mood among stock investors isn’t likely to change until they get a handle on when the Fed will slow the rate increases. That won’t be clear until it’s certain that inflation has peaked. The central bank raised its benchmark rate half a percentage point this month and is expected to do so again when it meets in June and July.
“The Fed will want to see clearer evidence that inflation is cooling and higher interest rates are slowing demand before they start thinking about the endpoint of the current rate hike cycle,” Bill Adams, the chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.
After the close of trading on Thursday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, acknowledged that the path ahead could be a painful one.

“The process of getting inflation down to 2 percent will also include some pain, but ultimately the most painful thing would be if we were to fail to deal with it and inflation were to get entrenched,” Mr. Powell said, speaking during an interview with Marketplace on Thursday.
The prospects of higher interest rates have driven technology stocks sharply lower this year. Among the largest tech companies, Apple fell 2.7 percent on Thursday, while Microsoft fell 2 percent.
In Europe, stock indexes ended lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.8 percent. Asian markets closed mostly lower.
Oil prices fell on Thursday, with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, down 0.4 percent to $106.13 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, settled at $107.45 a barrel."

Russia scales back its charge east
After a series of military setbacks, Moscow now appears to be focusing on a narrow objective: widening its holdings in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donbas. But even there Russia may be forced to scale back its ambition to take most of eastern Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War.
Russia still controls the wide swath of southern Ukraine it seized early in the war, including Kherson, and continues to impose a naval blockade that is strangling the Ukrainian economy. But Russia has not secured a major strategic gain in the east.
On Sunday, the Ukrainian military released a video purporting to show a small group of soldiers reaching the Russian border near Kharkiv — a powerful symbolic moment. Russian forces had to retreat from the city, Ukraine’s second-largest, earlier this month.
NATO: The alliance is preparing to fast-track admission for Finland and Sweden, which formally announced that they will seek membership. On Monday, NATO forces from 14 countries held a large, long-planned military exercise on Russia’s doorstep in Estonia, a tough Kremlin critic.

Vladimir Putin: The Russian president is increasingly isolated. He met with his five closest allies on Monday; only Belarus spoke up in support of Putin’s war.

Australia’s bush fire reckoning
In late 2019 and early 2020, fires tore through southeastern Australia. Barely one in 10 families in the affected region of southeastern Australia have finished rebuilding, local government data shows. Most have not even started.
The halting recovery efforts could have profound political import. The ruling conservative coalition holds a one-seat majority in Parliament and is already expected to lose some urban seats.
The once-conservative rural towns south of Sydney could also defect. Angered by a lack of government support after the bush fires, they may vote for the opposition Labor party in the Australian election on Saturday.

Students are upset that they cannot order food and are required to isolate, while teachers and their families can leave the campus freely. On an online forum, one student called the policy contradictory. Another said it was “a joke indeed.”
In response to student frustrations, the authorities tried to put up a wall separating students from faculty and staff. More than 200 people left their dorms to protest.

Reaction: The government quickly moved to censor videos and photos from the brief protest, which quickly spread on China’s internet.
Analysis: Peking University, which has a history of occasional organized unrest, holds a special place in Beijing’s cultural and political life. The demonstration underscores a growing challenge for officials, who must assuage anger while fighting the highly infectious Omicron variant.

Here are live updates from the Saturday mass shooting in upstate New York.
The accused shooter, an 18-year-old white man, had previously been investigated for a violent threat. He had planned to attack a second target.
Officials released the full list of victims, almost all of whom were Black.
The gunman published a hate-filled racist screed before the attack, connecting it to the livestreamed murder of 51 people by a gunman at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.
Some right-wing politicians have helped promote “replacement theory,” the racist ideology that the gunman espoused. In recent years, other perpetrators of mass shootings have also cited the idea, popularized on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show.
In other news: A gunman killed one person and critically wounded four others at a Southern California church before congregants overpowered him and tied him up. He has been charged with murder.

ARTS AND IDEAS
Optimizing “happiness”
Long before the pandemic, many rolled their eyes at companies that purported to be focused on keeping workers feeling happy: tech companies with ball pits and slides, banking firms with lunch buffets and frozen rosé.
Now, as corporate America trundles back to long-dormant office spaces, companies are in hot pursuit of similar gimmicks like a Lizzo concert at Google and beer tastings at Microsoft.
There’s a lot of social science research to suggest that happiness does lead to productivity and profit. But it’s not cheap: A “happiness M.B.A.” program for senior leaders is $18,000, not to mention the costs of so-called perks.
However, many workers prefer flexibility over a one-off rave. Instead of fomenting genuine happiness, the corporate carrots carry a whiff of pandering, a transparent attempt to turn feelings into productivity.
“People are trying to get everything back to ‘normal,’ but the truth is, normal was terrible for some people,” a program officer at a global foundation said. “Why not just give people what they actually want?”

2022-05-18,"Elon Musk called a prominent index of socially responsible companies a “scam” on Wednesday after it dropped Tesla because of the way the carmaker handled accusations of racial discrimination at its factory in California.
The S&P 500 ESG Index, a listing of companies that meet certain environmental, social and governance standards, removed Tesla last month. But the decision to eject the world’s largest maker of electric vehicles from a club that includes oil producers like Exxon Mobil attracted little notice until S&P Global, which manages the index, offered an explanation this week.
S&P cited claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif.. Those claims have prompted a California state agency to file a lawsuit, which Tesla is contesting. S&P said its decision was also influenced by Tesla’s handling of an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to the company’s driver-assistance system, known as Autopilot.
“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider E.S.G. lens,” Margaret Dorn, head of E.S.G. indices in North America at S&P, said in the firm’s explanation.

Tesla stock was the fourth most heavily weighted in the index before it was removed, behind Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. Funds that track the index were obligated to own Tesla shares when it joined the index in May 2021 and to sell them when it was booted off.
Exxon Mobil is the ninth most heavily weighted stock in the index, prompting a blast from Mr. Musk. “Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list!” he wrote on Twitter. “ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.”
S&P did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Exxon made the list and Tesla didn’t.
Tesla has previously faced criticism from investors who say it has released little information about the impact of its manufacturing or labor practices.
“Elon has branded himself and the entire company on the importance of environmental sustainability,” said Kristin Hull, the founder and chief executive of Nia Impact Capital, a fund in Oakland, Calif., that invests in companies with a positive social impact. Yet, Dr. Hull added, Tesla has been stingy with information about its water use or how it sources materials used in batteries.

“You can’t have a racial equity lawsuit and be considered a top E.S.G. name,” she added.
Passive index funds, which collectively direct about a third of all the assets invested in the stock market, are required to match their portfolios to the index they track.  Getting included in or removed from an index can impact a company’s stock price. General Electric’s shares, for instance, fell 3 percent shortly after it was announced in mid-2018 that the company, an original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was being removed from that index.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
But the drop in Tesla’s share price of more than 30 percent since the end of March was more likely the result of concern about Mr. Musk’s offer to buy Twitter and a broader shift in how investors view technology stocks.
S&P reported that there were $65 billion in assets invested in funds tied to its E.S.G. index at the end of December 2020, the most recently available figure. That’s far smaller than the $13 trillion that is in funds tied to the more widely followed S&P 500 index, of which Tesla remains a member. That $65 billion is also small compared to Tesla’s overall market value of nearly $750 billion. And only a portion of the holdings of those E.S.G. funds are in Tesla.
What’s more, of the $65 billion tied to the E.S.G. index, only $11 billion of that money is invested in passive index funds, which would be required to sell their Tesla stakes. The rest of the money is in funds that benchmark their performance against the S&P 500 E.S.G. index. Many of those funds are actively managed by portfolio managers. Those funds aren’t required to sell their Tesla holdings, but they might do so in order to not deviate too far from the index that they are compared to by investors.
“Tesla is just simply not an open-and-shut E.S.G. case,” said Jon Hale, who directs sustainability research at mutual fund tracking firm Morningstar. “While it’s clear the company’s product is beneficial to the environment, Tesla is now a big company and it also has an impact on employees and customers, and those issues concern E.S.G. investors.”

Several other prominent companies were also dropped from the index in April when S&P determined they no longer met the criteria for membership. They included Chevron, Delta Air Lines, Home Depot and News Corp.
Even if ejections do not impact the value of a company’s shares, they could have an impact on a company’s actions. “Elon Musk and Tesla may be the exception,” Mr. Hale said. “But the flip side of that is very few companies want to be E.S.G. laggards in the current environment.”"

2022-05-20,"Mosopefoluwa Ogundipe and Iyanuoluwa Imoru are from the same Nigerian state, Ondo, the same local government area, Akoko North-East, and the same Yoruba tribe. But it wasn’t until they were halfway around the world that their paths finally crossed.
Mr. Ogundipe, 28, who goes by Sope, and Ms. Imoru, 29, known as Iyanu, met in September 2019, at the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference in San Diego. Ms. Imoru was in a line of people waiting to speak to representatives from Microsoft when she heard Mr. Ogundipe’s familiar accent.
They made some small talk, but Ms. Imoru remained laser focused. “I was trying to get a job, not meet a guy,” she said.
Two days later, at the same conference, they attended a gathering on the beach, where they spent much more time chatting. Afterward, they shared an Uber back to their respective hotels. When the driver accidentally passed Mr. Ogundipe’s hotel, he took it as a sign that he was supposed to get her phone number.

After the computing conference, they kept in touch sporadically, and over time, more regularly, until they were speaking daily.
The two had relocated to the United States a year earlier, in 2018, to further their education. A graduate of the University of Lagos, Mr. Ogundipe had enrolled at the University of San Francisco to earn a master’s degree in computer science. Ms. Imoru, who graduated from Obafemi Awolowo University and holds a law degree from the Nigerian Law School, came to pursue a master’s degree in computer information systems at Prairie View A&M University in Texas.
Soon after Mr. Ogundipe completed his master’s program in May 2020, he took a job in Austin, Texas. The two then began to see each other every weekend, in either Austin or Prairie View.
Mr. Ogundipe, who had never had a girlfriend, knew that he wanted Ms. Imoru to be his first one because they shared the same values and envisioned a similar future. “It was just this deep-seated knowledge that I knew that this is the person,” he said.

Though open to becoming a couple, Ms. Imoru was at first hesitant about marriage. “Let’s see if we can get through a week of dating in person,” she recalled thinking.
By August 2020, she had come around to the idea. “I noticed how great we were together in person,” said Ms. Imoru, who completed her master’s program that December.
“I love how smart he is,” she added. “One of our first conversations was about a computer issue and it went on for several hours, but in that, he showed how he’s smart, funny, and always makes me laugh.”
In February 2021, Ms. Imoru began her current job as an infrastructure engineering associate at AllianceBernstein, an asset management firm in Nashville, where she moved that July and now lives.
The month before, Mr. Ogundipe proposed to her on a boat while they were on a trip to Florida in June 2021.

Currently living in Austin, Mr. Ogundipe works remotely as a software engineer at LinkedIn, the online networking platform, in Sunnyvale, Calif.
The couple married April 30 at the Woodlands Methodist Church in the Woodlands, Texas. Dr. John Hull, the pastor of missions at the church, officiated at the ceremony before around 250 guests. A reception followed at a hall on the church’s grounds.
The night before they were married, they held a traditional Nigerian wedding ceremony at the Crowne Plaza Shenandoah, also in the Woodlands, with about 120 family members and friends. During that ceremony, Mr. Ogundipe’s family presented Ms. Imoru’s family with food items like yams, oil and rice, and Mr. Ogundipe and his groomsmen prostrated themselves in front of her family. The bride, who is taking the groom’s surname, plans to relocate to Austin to live with him.
About a year before the couple met, Mr. Ogundipe’s mother had sent him a WhatsApp message telling him that she had been praying that he would bring home a Nigerian woman. “All you can do is pray,” Mr. Ogundipe recalled replying. “I’m open to anyone.”
Of the woman he ultimately found, Mr. Ogundipe said, “I preferred this,” adding that back then, “I just didn’t know it.”"

Growing up in the 1980s, I knew there were kids like those on “Stranger Things,” which returns Friday for its fourth season, who spent their after-school hours playing Dungeons & Dragons. I was not one of them; I played with Barbies. I figured what I was doing with dolls — acting out scenes involving homework, school dances and what happened last weekend at the plastic pool — was a far cry from the secretive world of the D&D table, with its arcane mythos and complicated rules.
It wasn’t until 2000, when an episode of the show “Freaks and Geeks” featured kids playing D&D, that I got a glimpse into how role-playing games worked. In essence, it was not so different from what my friends and I were doing with Barbies: imagining and then inhabiting characters, writing stories collaboratively, escaping reality while developing real-life social skills.
While I retired my Barbies by the time puberty hit, the universe of Dungeons & Dragons is intricate and expansive enough that it has continuing appeal for adults. In fact, it has so fully emerged from nerd-dom that it has become “something of a social flex — the antithesis of the popularity contest that was the 1990s and early 2000s, an antidote to our more basic tendencies,” Amelia Diamond writes in The Times this morning. Vin Diesel plays. So does Tiffany Haddish.
I’ve written about how socializing is weird lately. D&D offers one way to alleviate some of the anxiety. Rules govern interactions, and a dungeon master who acts as both narrator and referee enforces them. In the safety of this container, players explore, improvise, cocreate worlds.

“All of us at times feel a little inadequate in dealing with the modern world,” Gary Gygax, one of the creators of D&D, once said. “It would feel much better if we knew that we were a superhero or a mighty wizard.”
D&D and other role-playing games, improv comedy, murder-mystery parties where each guest is assigned a part in a whodunit, even escape rooms: They’re all creative, rule-bound forms of fun where scenes are created in real time and success requires teamwork and trust.
They’re lo-fi ways to socialize through performance, a relief from social media venues that insist we perform as ourselves for an audience of friends and followers. These activities give us permission to play, to drop our inhibitions and try on new personas. They let us escape into another world for a little while.

Yes, they are distinctly cupcake-like: fluffy and sugary, and completely delightful with your morning cup of coffee or tea. But if the idea of cake before noon puts you off, serve them as a midafternoon snack or even dessert — the after-dinner kind of dessert, that is.

2022-05-23,"A group of workers at a video game studio that is part of Activision Blizzard has voted to form a union, a first for a major North American video game company.
The vote, which passed 19 to 3, affects 28 quality-assurance employees at Raven Software, the Wisconsin studio that helps to develop the popular Call of Duty game. The workers voted over the past several weeks, and the results were tallied by the National Labor Relations Board on Monday. Activision has one week to formally object if it finds grounds for complaint.
The new union, the Game Workers Alliance, is the culmination of months of labor organizing at Activision, which has faced increasing pressure from employees to improve working conditions after a lawsuit accused the company of having a sexist culture in which women were routinely harassed.
Organizing at Raven in particular increased in intensity in December, when quality-assurance, or Q.A., workers walked out to protest the ending of about a dozen workers’ contracts. The Communications Workers of America, a prominent tech, media and communications union, helped lead the unionization effort.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Our biggest hope is that our union serves as inspiration for the growing movement of workers organizing at video game studios to create better games and build workplaces that reflect our values and empower all of us,” workers in the new union said in a statement.
Sara Steffens, the secretary-treasurer of the C.W.A., said that she was “thrilled” to welcome the new union and that “these workers will soon have an enforceable union contract and a voice on the job.” Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, also cheered the new union on Twitter.
Employees in the video game industry have complained for years about poor pay, gender discrimination and “crunch” — a term for arduous, 12-to-14-hour shifts given to workers in a rush to meet deadlines. Those crunches particularly affect Q.A. workers, who say they are often treated as second-class workers. In recent years, employees have begun to organize. But until now, none of the major North American video game developers had a union.
The new union affects only a small group of workers — the 28 Q.A. workers at the Raven studio, where several hundred people work. Activision, which is in the process of being acquired by Microsoft for $70 billion, had argued that all workers at the studio should be eligible to vote. The N.L.R.B. rejected that assertion at a hearing in April.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
On Monday, Activision repeated its objection, arguing that the decision to unionize “should not be made by 19 Raven employees.” The company would not say whether it planned to file an objection, saying only that it was “committed to doing what’s best for the studio and our employees.”
An N.L.R.B. regional director has “found merit to the allegations” levied by C.W.A. that Activision violated federal labor law by telling employees not to talk about wages or workplace conditions, maintaining an “overly broad” social media policy and surveilling employees who were engaging in “protected concerted activity.” The labor board said it would issue a complaint against Activision if it could not settle the case."

2022-05-25,"WASHINGTON — More than 50 corporations have joined a global “buyers’ club” that pledges to purchase aluminum, steel and other commodities made from processes that emit little to no carbon, a move that will be announced on Wednesday by leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
John Kerry, President Biden’s special climate envoy, and a group of billionaire corporate titans — including Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Marc Benioff, the chief executive officer of Salesforce — are gathering at a Swiss Alps resort for the forum.

The idea behind the buyers’ club, known as the First Movers Coalition, is to stoke demand for green versions of materials that have proved difficult to manufacture without significant carbon dioxide emissions.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The group includes Ford Motor and the Volvo Group, both of which have pledged that 10 percent of their primary aluminum purchases will be manufactured with little to no carbon emissions by 2030. Aluminium production is responsible for 2 percent of global emissions — and the advanced technologies needed to create it without releasing carbon dioxide are not yet commercially available.
Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and Microsoft and Salesforce have collectively promised to spend $500 million on technology to capture and store carbon emissions. Three other companies — AES, an electric power distribution company headquartered in Virginia; Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, a Japanese transport company; and Swiss Re, a reinsurance company based in Switzerland — each committed to removing 50,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere by 2030. The governments of India, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Singapore and Britain have also joined the coalition.
“We are creating a demand for low-carbon products,” particularly for nascent clean technologies in steel, aviation, aluminum, cement and chemicals, said Borge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum. Those sectors are responsible for about 30 percent of global emissions, but that figure is expected to rise to about 50 percent of emissions by midcentury.
Mr. Brende noted that with climate change already having an impact in countries like India and Pakistan, which have faced record-breaking heat for weeks, the human and economic toll of global warming is mounting.
“The price of inaction far exceeds the price of action when it comes to climate change,” Mr. Brende said. “If we don’t use the purchasing power of the big companies now to address the hard-to-abate sectors, this is going to have such a high price for the world moving forward.”

The future of fossil fuels and the fight against climate change in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis has been a major topic this week in Davos. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said she hoped to see an agreement among countries in the European Union to sanction Russian oil in the coming weeks.
Speaking on the main stage at Davos on Tuesday, Ms. von der Leyen said there was no doubt that “we are witnessing how Russia is weaponizing its energy supplies.”
Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a crucial vote for potential climate legislation in the evenly divided Senate, told a crowd in Davos that fossil fuels — the burning of which is driving climate change — must be part of the solution.
“The United States of America has an abundant supply of natural gas and oil,” Mr. Manchin said, adding, “We can use our fossil and the cleanest technology humanly possible to make sure that we are reliable, we have reliability and we have security.”
Mr. Kerry on Tuesday sat on a panel with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua. The two later met privately — the first face-to-face meeting between the top negotiators of the world’s two biggest climate polluters since the global climate summit last year in Glasgow.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking on the sidelines at the conference, Mr. Kerry called the meeting “constructive.” He acknowledged that the broader disagreements between Washington and Beijing were having an impact on climate talks. But, he said, “we are trying very hard to maintain capacity for serious progress because the world can’t make progress without China and the United States working on this.”
“It’s imperative we continue to work together,” he added.
In a joint interview, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Brende said they believed it was still possible to meet the current need for more oil and natural gas to replace Russian energy while still significantly cutting fossil fuel emissions over the next decades.
“I think it’s fair to say that the situation in Ukraine has changed some people’s narrative,” Mr. Kerry said. “And there’s a risk here that some of the efforts which had a lot of momentum coming out of Glasgow are being relitigated, if you will, in certain quarters.” But, he added, “the private sector is stepping up here in an unprecedented way.”
Mr. Kerry intends to meet again with Mr. Xie next week in Berlin, where leaders are gathering for a meeting of officials from the seven countries with the largest advanced economies, known as the Group of 7.
China has pledged to start reducing its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, but has not said how high its emissions will reach before the curve bends.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Xie said Tuesday that “concrete action has been taken,” referring to China’s deployment of wind, solar and battery storage, and said nations must now make good on the promises they had already made.
The United States under Mr. Biden has pledged to cut emissions at least 50 percent below 2005 levels by the end of this decade. Congress has not passed legislation that would enable those cuts, however, and a Supreme Court ruling this summer could limit the administration’s ability to use regulatory actions to tackle climate change.
“The United States, even through Congress, has not yet passed a climate piece of legislation, has been doing an enormous amount through executive order,” Mr. Kerry said, insisting that “we are full-on engaged here” and that “we do have a path” in the United States to meeting Mr. Biden’s climate goals. However, he acknowledged, “we’re not on it completely yet.”

The chip manufacturer Broadcom announced a blockbuster $61 billion deal this morning for VMware, a tech company that specializes in data centers. The deal is the second largest this year, behind Microsoft’s January acquisition of Activision, and one of the largest in tech this past decade. It values VMware at over 40 percent more than its share price before rumors of a deal began to circulate this week.
The proposed combination would make Broadcom a significant player in cloud computing. VMware has more than 500,000 customers and counts all of the major cloud providers as partners, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The VM stands for virtual machines.
Broadcom’s C.E.O., Hock Tan, has been one of the most acquisitive forces in the semiconductor industry, stitching the company together one chip deal at a time. That effort sputtered when former President Donald Trump blocked Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion takeover of Qualcomm in March 2018 on national security grounds. (Broadcom was once based in Singapore but has moved its headquarters to San Jose, Calif.) Since then, Tan has diversified his targets: He bought the software company CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in 2018 and a security division of Symantec for $10.7 billion the following year.
But the latest acquisition isn’t a done, done deal, yet. The terms include a go-shop period, giving VMware’s management 40 days to seek a better offer. Buying VMware could make sense for any number of other companies, such as IBM or Intel. It’s also the business that Intel’s C.E.O., Pat Gelsinger, previously ran. “I have a lot of soul in that company,” Gelsinger said of VMware this week while at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. “And any change in structure or acquisition, what I would be motivated to see is the innovation spirit of VMWare alive and well.” Also at Davos: representatives from VMware.
There could be more deals to come. As the stock market has cratered technology companies’ valuations, potential cash buyers could scoop up companies at a discount. Private equity firms have also been scouting for bargains, DealBook hears.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Apple raises pay. The iPhone maker yesterday said that the minimum hourly wage for U.S. its retail workers would rise to $22 per hour and that it would award annual raises several months early. Other companies are also increasing salaries, amid a tight labor market and rising prices, and as retail employees consider unionizing.
Vanguard stands by its fossil fuel investments. Vanguard, the world’s second largest asset manager and the largest investor in coal companies globally, engages with companies on climate risks to ensure the market has priced them in, its C.E.O., Tim Buckley, said. “Climate change is a material risk but it is only one factor in an investment decision,” he added.
The S.E.C. suggests more disclosure requirements for socially responsible funds. The agency issued two proposals yesterday that focus on concerns about “greenwashing” and giving investors more information about exchange-traded funds and mutual funds with an E.S.G. focus.
Bolt, the payments start-up, lays off employees. Maju Kuruvilla, the chief executive, attributed the layoffs to “structural changes” amid “macro challenges,” but did not provide further details. It’s a reflection of a souring fund-raising environment for start-ups. On Monday, Klarna, the Swedish payments giant, said it would lay off about 10 percent of its staff.
India’s blistering heat and storms devastate crops. Intense heat in northern India and heavy rains in southern India have wiped out mango crops and threatened the livelihoods of the thousands of small farmers. The heat wave exemplifies challenges India, the world’s largest mango producer, faces in feeding a growing population of 1.4 billion as the effects of climate change worsen.

The Fed’s need for speed
Stocks jumped yesterday after minutes from the Fed’s most recent meeting showed that officials believe they need to move “expeditiously” to bring down inflation, raising interest rates in half-point chunks rather than their usual quarter points.
The S&P 500 ended the day up nearly 1 percent, though it’s still well down for the year. Futures markets suggest stocks could rise again today.
That’s the opposite of the market’s usual response to rate rises, which tend to slow the economy and squeeze corporate profits. So what’s different? “Investors want the Fed to get out of the way soon,” Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed official now at Dreyfus and Mellon, told DealBook. The thinking, he said, was that half-point raises would be “better than doing quarters to get to the same place.”

The question is whether a fast-moving Fed is more likely to hurt the economy. Most Wall Street strategists don’t predict a recession until 2023. And it’s easier to absorb rate increases in good times than bad. But Wall Street may not have the timing right. If the economy is weaker than it looks, raising rates sharply could lead to a crash.
There are signs that the economy may be starting to skid. Last week, retailers including Target and Walmart reported weaker-than-expected earnings. They said their biggest problem now was not stocking goods — the supply-chain trouble that has pushed prices higher — but getting them off their shelves. That suggests consumer demand is softening.

Some prominent investors are pushing for even more inflation-fighting. Earlier this week, the hedge fund manager Bill Ackman tweeted that the Fed shouldn’t be worried about what happens to the economy in the next year. Aggressive rate increases would “protect and enhance” the economy for all, he argued.
But some economists argue that inflation may already have peaked. “The demands for a reign of fire and blood to curb inflation are getting louder even as the case for such a reign is getting weaker,” tweeted our Times Opinion colleague Paul Krugman.

What Musk’s new financing means for the Twitter deal
Elon Musk won’t leverage Tesla’s shares to buy Twitter after all. The Tesla C.E.O. and outspoken, especially on Twitter, billionaire revealed a new financing arrangement yesterday for his $44.5 billion bid to buy the social network. Gone is the loan that he planned to take out against Tesla shares. Instead, more will come right out of Musk’s, and potentially others’, pockets.
The move comes as Tesla’s stock price has fallen some 30 percent, to just under $660, over the past month. And it highlights Musk’s commitment to the Twitter deal, even as he continues to rail against the company. Shares of Twitter are up 10 percent on the news, but at $39, remain well below the $54.20 a share Musk has agreed, signaling that investors still aren’t certain of the deal.

Musk had already reduced his reliance on his Tesla shares. His initial plan was to put $33.5 billion up to buy Twitter, and finance the rest, $11 billion, with debt. Of the $33.5 billion in equity, $21 billion was directly from him,with $12.5 billion coming through a bank loan against his Tesla shares. He later brought in $7 billion from outside investors, cutting the loan to $6.25 billion. With this latest announcement, he is scrapping the loan entirely.
Still, the reason for the latest switch is not clear. It could be that borrowing against Tesla stock put the deal at risk, now that the carmaker’s share price has dropped. (Musk has already borrowed tens of billions against his shares.) Musk also says he is continuing to talk with Twitter shareholders, including the co-founder Jack Dorsey, about rolling over their stakes to help finance his deal.
None of this has stopped Musk from throwing jabs. He took aim at Twitter after the F.T.C. and Justice Department fined the company $150 million for doing less than it had promised to protect users’ data from marketers. “If Twitter was not truthful here, what else is not true?” Musk said. “This is very concerning news.”
Gun stocks rise despite E.S.G. concerns
The rise of E.S.G. investing, as well as mass shootings like the one that happened this week in Uvalde, Texas, put a spotlight on the role financial institutions play in propping up gun companies. Shares in Smith & Wesson, Sturm Ruger and Vista Outdoor, among other gun companies, rose yesterday, as is typical after mass shootings.

E.S.G., which stands for environmental, social and governance, has become an important force on Wall Street. Some call it “woke capitalism.” Nonetheless, many money managers still own gun stocks. BlackRock and Vanguard invest in gun stocks, for clients, mostly through funds that track the market or portions of it. Sellers of guns and ammunition, like Walmart, are even more common in broad-based mutual funds, index funds and pension funds.
The question now is whether another mass shooting could finally inspire Wall Street to think more strongly about divesting from guns. “School shootings really grab people’s attention” in a way that perhaps other mass shootings don’t, said Jon Hale, the director of sustainability research for the Americas at Sustainalytics, a unit of the investment research firm Morningstar. And with the Texas attack coming so soon after the Buffalo shooting, he expects that financial advisers will face another uptick in calls about gun stocks from clients. “Maybe they thought about it before,” he said, “and something like this happens and it reminds them again: I should check my investments.”
Some E.S.G. funds have been slow to divest for several reasons, Alex Edmans, a finance professor at London Business School who is on the responsible investment committee for the investment management company Royal London Asset Management, told DealBook. As with other investors, an objective of E.S.G. funds is to get strong returns. “It’s not clear from a purely financial perspective that you would necessarily want to exclude guns,” he said. “If we don’t think regulation is going to be changing, there’s an economic case for investing in them.”

2022-06-01,"Elon Musk is demanding that his workers return to the office.
Mr. Musk, the world’s richest man, sent a pair of similar memos on Tuesday to push his employees at SpaceX, the rocket company he runs, and Tesla, the electric carmaker he leads, to spend time in the office.
In his email to SpaceX employees, Mr. Musk told workers that they were required to “spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week.” Those who did not do so would be fired, he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times.
“The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,” Mr. Musk said. “That is why I spent so much time in the factory — so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, SpaceX would long ago have gone bankrupt.”
In his memo to Tesla’s executive staff, which was posted by two pro-Tesla Twitter accounts and which the billionaire appeared to confirm, Mr. Musk also wrote that “anyone who wishes to do remote work” must be in the office for a minimum of 40 hours a week. Those who decline should “depart Tesla,” he added.

With his twin notes, Mr. Musk waded directly into a fractious debate over the right way for corporations to bring workers back to the office during the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past couple of years, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and many other companies have announced and then delayed return-to-office dates as coronavirus surges have complicated plans. Remote work has become normalized.
The issue has become more fraught as coronavirus vaccinations have increased and an abatement of the pandemic seemed to be near. Some companies began saying they expected workers to return to the office. Still, plans have continued to fluctuate. Apple last month suspended its requirement that employees return to the office in May for at least three days a week because of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. Airbnb recently told its employees that they never had to return to the office.
Mr. Musk, Tesla and SpaceX did not return requests for comment.
Many employees at Tesla and SpaceX had already been back in the office to some extent. In 2020, as “nonessential” workplaces in California closed their doors during the early days of the pandemic, SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., used its exemption as a government contractor to remain open. In a March 2020 email, which was earlier reported by BuzzFeed News, Mr. Musk told SpaceX employees that they had a higher risk of being killed in a car crash than dying from the coronavirus.
In May 2020, Mr. Musk also attacked local officials in the San Francisco Bay Area for not letting him reopen Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif. Tesla sued Alameda County, where the factory is situated, and reopened it anyway, in defiance of health officials’ instructions.

Tesla, which had more than 99,000 employees at the end of last year, has moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Palo Alto, Calif., though it still has a significant manufacturing and operational presence in California. SpaceX employs about 12,000 people, Mr. Musk said in a recent interview.
Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, said Mr. Musk’s directives to employees at SpaceX and Tesla were among the strictest of tech companies. Many tech companies have instead considered hybrid models in which employees can work from home for part of the time, he said.
Mr. Bloom said he expected SpaceX and Tesla to lose about 10 percent to 20 percent of their current work forces and for recruiters to try to poach employees by offering jobs with more flexible work options.
Many Tesla and SpaceX employees who work in cutting-edge tech may believe in Mr. Musk, but there are also people “who are in more common activities like I.T., finance, H.R. and payroll,” Mr. Bloom said. “They may say: ‘I’m not designing cars. I’m doing the payroll of employees, and I can do that somewhere else.’”
Annie Dean, the head of distributed work for Atlassian, an Australian software company, called Mr. Musk’s view “outdated.”

“This mind-set is regressive and discounts the last two years of collaborative, digital-first work,” said Ms. Dean, who was a former head of remote work at Meta, the owner of Facebook, in an email.
Mr. Musk has long been known as a demanding boss. At times, he tried setting an example for hard work, taking meetings late into the night, sending emails at all hours and even sleeping at the Tesla factory to help ramp up production in 2018.
It is unclear if Mr. Musk will adhere to his own rules of spending 40 hours a week in Tesla’s and SpaceX’s offices. He is rarely in the office and often travels, said two people who have worked with him and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They expressed concerns about how the return-to-office policies would affect recruiting and retention at the companies.
Mr. Musk is also closing a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. He has not said what he expects of Twitter employees in terms of time spent in the office. In 2020, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive at the time, informed employees that many of them would be allowed to work from home permanently.
Adrian Zamora, a Twitter spokesman, said Twitter had no plans to change its policy on flexible work.
In his email to SpaceX employees on Tuesday, Mr. Musk suggested that companies that didn’t require workers to return to the office would not be able to ship “a great new product.”

“SpaceX has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company in space,” he said. “This will not happen by phoning it in.”

2022-06-02,"Phil Knight, a founder of the athletic apparel company Nike, and Alan Smolinisky, an entrepreneur and part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, have submitted a bid to purchase the Portland Trail Blazers, according to people familiar with their bid.
The offer from Knight and Smolinisky to purchase the Trail Blazers, an N.B.A. team, is for more than $2 billion, and was submitted in recent weeks, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the offer was private.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Blazers said: “An offer was made by Phil Knight. The team remains not for sale.”
The Trail Blazers are owned by a trust controlled by the family of Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder who died in 2018. Knight and Smolinisky have been in conversations with Jody Allen, Paul Allen’s sister and the chair of the trust, about a potential deal in recent weeks, the people said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The trust also owns the N.F.L.’s Seattle Seahawks.
How close the parties might be to an agreement was unclear. A person close to Blazers ownership with knowledge of the company’s operations insisted the team was not for sale.
Paul Allen purchased the Blazers in 1988 for $70 million. The value of major sports franchises has risen over the decades, owing in part to the appreciation of media rights, meaning that the team could sell for billions. The last N.B.A. team to trade hands, the Minnesota Timberwolves, sold with the Minnesota Lynx, a W.N.B.A. team, for $1.5 billion.
The English soccer club Chelsea was sold for $3.1 billion last month, while the Denver Broncos are for sale and expected to fetch an N.F.L.-record price. The Broncos are also being sold by a trust after the death of the team’s longtime owner, Pat Bowlen, in 2019.
Jody Allen has said little about her plans for the Blazers, and Chris McGowan, who was the team’s president until November, said in September that the team was not for sale. Still, it has been widely expected that the Blazers would eventually be put up for sale.
Allen did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Knight, 84, who co-founded Nike in 1964, has long been Oregon’s richest person and has a net worth in the tens of billions of dollars. He is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of Nike, but remains on the company’s board. Despite his deep involvement in sports, Knight has never owned a team, and in 2011 he even told a reporter that he specifically was not interested in owning the Blazers.

Knight’s involvement could suggest that there are no plans to relocate the Blazers from Portland, Ore., as has occasionally been suggested over the years. At a news conference before Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals between Golden State and the Boston Celtics on Thursday, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver said “at some point, the team will be sold,” but that he did not know when.

“Portland has been a wonderful community for the N.B.A.,” Silver said. “The team has been there over 50 years now, and our preference, my preference, would be that that team remain in Portland as part of this process.”
Smolinisky, a real estate entrepreneur based in Los Angeles, joined the Dodgers ownership group in 2019.
Little is known about what Paul Allen might have stipulated for the future of the team before his death. But generally, while an individual owner can sell a team to anybody for any reason, trustees have a stricter fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the trust. Any sale of the team would also have to be approved by three-quarters of the N.B.A.’s owners.
The Blazers used to be one of the N.B.A.’s highest spending teams, and at one point Paul Allen said that he had lost hundreds of millions of dollars operating the franchise. But the low initial purchase price means the team can be sold for many multiples of Allen’s original $70 million investment, speaking to the enduring financial windfall of owning a major professional sports franchise.

Buying sports teams in past decades was often as emotional of a decision as it was financial, with teams often run more like family businesses with strong ties to a region. Over the past two decades, however, team valuations have exploded, revenue streams like media agreements and arena naming rights deals have grown in value, and deep-pocketed investor groups from the world of tech and private equity have bid for teams.
If the Blazers were sold, the new ownership group would inherit a team looking for a new direction after a tumultuous year. Last summer, the Blazers hired Chauncey Billups as their head coach, renewing questions surrounding a sexual assault accusation made against him when he was a player. McGowan resigned in November. The next month, the team’s general manager, Neil Olshey, was fired after a workplace misconduct investigation that found unspecified violations.
On the court, the Blazers limped to a 27-55 record as the star guard Damian Lillard played just 29 games because of injuries, and his backcourt partner, CJ McCollum, was traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in February. The Blazers missed the playoffs, but the Pelicans, fueled by McCollum, made a surprising push into the playoffs, where they lost in the first round."
2022-06-03,"When Sheryl Sandberg said this week that she was resigning as chief operating officer of Meta, she also reflected on her legacy as a woman in tech.
“I’m especially proud that this is a company where many, many exceptional women and people from diverse backgrounds have risen through our ranks and become leaders — both in our company and in leadership roles elsewhere,” she wrote in an announcement posted on her Facebook and Instagram pages.
Yet even as Ms. Sandberg lauded the progress of women at Meta, the broader reality for female leaders at the top of the tech industry has been far more disappointing. And with her exit this fall, Silicon Valley is losing one of its most visible and outspoken female executives, leaving few — some would say zero — similar peers in her wake.
Ms. Sandberg, 52, was part of a cohort of women at major tech companies who made keynote speeches, rose to the level of founders like Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg, and had a seat at the table at high-powered business gatherings like the Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. But over the years, many of these women — including Marissa Mayer of Yahoo, Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Ginni Rometty of IBM — have departed, often with their reputations in tatters.
More broadly, women have not made notable gains in recent years in the highest echelons of Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta and other tech giants where the corridors of power continue to be dominated by men. The industry’s record on female leadership trails that of other industries, even as tech exerts more influence in the global economy and in people’s lives.
“The C.E.O. is the face of the company,” and in the tech industry, “somehow collectively the world seems to want the face to be a white man,” said Jenny Lefcourt, co-founder of All Raise, a nonprofit focused on advancing gender and racial equality, and an investor at Freestyle Capital.

2022-06-06,"CUPERTINO, Calif. — More than two years into the coronavirus pandemic, Apple made a big push on Monday to return to normalcy by inviting hundreds of software developers and journalists to its campus for an unveiling of a range of new software features that expand the iPhone’s utility.
Over a two-hour presentation, Apple revealed a buy-now-pay-later program that splits a purchase over several months, much like programs offered by PayPal and others. It also said it was expanding the ability to use an iPhone to unlock doors to apartments, hotel rooms and rental cars. And it introduced a version of CarPlay that would take over a vehicle’s entire dashboard, providing speed and fuel information as well as maps and music.
Collectively, the new features show how Tim Cook, the chief executive, is still finding ways to expand the usefulness and longevity of Apple’s most important product while wringing more sales out of it through features that thrust the company deeper into adjacent industries such as finance, real estate and autos.
“They are the digital control center, and they are extending their reach as more and more devices are digitized,” said Bob O’Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research, a firm specializing in tech research. “Much of this is not going to change the world, but they are enhancements that give a little freshness that people appreciate.”

The software updates continue a yearslong lull in the introduction of a new product category from a company that its co-founder Steve Jobs made synonymous with revolutionary new devices. Apple last unveiled a new product category, wearables, in 2014 when it introduced the Apple Watch.
The pandemic has helped increase sales of Apple’s legacy products. Students and employees forced to work from home found value in upgrading to the latest versions of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Many turned to video games and subscriptions for Apple TV+, helping increase the company’s sales last year by 33 percent to $366 billion.
On Monday, Apple looked to further the momentum of its Macs by updating its most popular computer, the MacBook Air. The new version sheds a decade-old wedge-shaped case in favor of a slender, rectangular laptop. The computer comes in a multitude of colors, including silver, space gray, gold and dark blue. The new model is 20 percent smaller than its predecessor and weighs 2.7 pounds, the company said.
The MacBook Air features Apple’s newest processor, the M2, which the company said offered increased performance even as it required less battery power.

The company said it was bringing more personalization to the iPhone, with the ability to customize the lock screen with colors, widgets and live activities. The new software will let iPhone users create custom lock screens for different purposes — like a screen for work that shows a preview of a calendar, or a personal screen that shows exercise activity data.

The new software features, part of Apple’s new iOS 16 operating system for iPhones, mirrored those that Google introduced for its Android system in 2021. Google created Material You, an offering that allows users to change the look of their lock screens by pulling from colors in their home screen wallpapers.

In addition to those updates, Apple said it was overhauling its messaging system, allowing people to recall and edit texts after sending them. There also is a new ability to compose messages by fluidly switching between typing text and dictating voice memos.
The company’s efforts to push beyond its existing businesses extended to new software for the iPad. It showcased new tools for workplace collaboration called Freeform, which allows colleagues to brainstorm across devices at the same time. The feature, similar to offerings from Microsoft and Google, has the potential to increase the iPad’s value to businesses.
Apple also unveiled software updates to its smartwatch that will allow runners to monitor their gait — potentially forgoing work with trainers — and help people track the stages of their sleep cycle.

The presentation was the first major event Apple has hosted on its campus in Cupertino since 2019. In light of rising coronavirus cases in the Bay Area, the company set up screens and chairs outside the cafeteria at the heart of its $5 billion campus, Apple Park. Attendees included developers, journalists and retail employees, a group that Apple is eager to improve relations with amid a rise in union organizing.
Though the event focused on existing products, it sprinkled hints of a virtual reality product that the company hopes will be its next business-altering device. Apple said it was making it easier for apps to use Siri, creating a shortcut that will make it possible to interact with apps through voice in future headsets, a person familiar with the project said. It also showed a demonstration of a new Resident Evil video game with the kind of sophisticated graphics customary in virtual reality games.
The headset, which looks like a pair of ski goggles, is not expected to ship until next year because of challenges with battery power and performance, two people familiar with the project said.
Its success is far from guaranteed. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, has struggled to broaden the appeal of its Quest virtual reality headset beyond avid video game players. Last year, it surpassed about 10 million unit sales, a small fraction of the 240 million iPhones that analysts estimate Apple shipped.
Apple has struggled to persuade developers to embrace its vision of a mixed reality world. In 2017, it introduced ARKit to allow developers to use the iPhone’s camera and motion sensor to begin blending the digital and real worlds. But about 70 percent of Apple’s developers said they did not use the tool, according to a survey of more than 500 developers by Creative Strategies, a technology research firm."

2022-06-08,"LOS ANGELES — President Biden opened the three-day Summit of the Americas on Wednesday by promising leaders from Latin America that the United States was committed to helping the region combat crime, corruption and its economic struggles.
“These challenges affect all of us,” Mr. Biden told the leaders at the opening ceremony of the summit, a gathering of nations of the Western Hemisphere intended to address the region’s shared problems. “All of our nations have a responsibility to step up and ease the pressure people are feeling today.”
The United States is serving as the host to the ninth of these summits, which began in Miami in 1994. In brief remarks, Mr. Biden delivered a version of his domestic economic pitch, urging governments in the hemisphere to invest in workers and the middle class.
“What’s true in the United States is true in every country: Trickle-down economics does not work,” he said, prompting some applause from the audience inside the Microsoft Theater near the Los Angeles Convention Center.

“When we invest in strengthening workers and the middle class,” he said, “the poor have a ladder up, and those at the top do just fine. That’s how we can increase opportunity and decrease persistent inequity.”
Mr. Biden has hoped to use the summit to reassert U.S. leadership in the region and make diplomatic progress on a variety of fronts, but his efforts are already facing severe challenges.
His call to “get to work building the future this region deserves” was undercut days ago when several of the most prominent of its leaders declined to attend, citing the president’s refusal to invite the leaders of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
But Mr. Biden proceeded on Wednesday night as if the snub had made no difference, saying that the gathering in Los Angeles would announce what he called “a groundbreaking, integrated new approach to managing migration and sharing responsibility across the hemisphere.”
White House officials have declined to offer specifics, but people familiar with the effort said that governments had been working on pledges for each to accept a certain number of refugees from the region.

Critics have questioned the value of such a declaration without the leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — which generate almost 66 percent of the migration to the United States border every year — in attendance.
Administration officials said that those countries supported the effort, despite their absence. In his remarks, Mr. Biden said the declaration “represents a mutual commitment to invest in regional solutions that enhance stability, increase opportunities for safe and orderly migration.”
The leaders will begin formal meetings on Thursday."

The billionaires pressing Biden on chip-making
A group of billionaires has quietly assembled a push to get Washington to spend $1 billion on a new initiative to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing back to the U.S. Eric Schmidt, former C.E.O. of Google and longtime Democratic donor, and Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, are both backers of the idea. They and others recently started an unusual nonprofit venture capital fund, called America’s Frontier Fund, to invest in American chip-making, and want taxpayers to help foot the bill, DealBook’s Ephrat Livni reports.

Semiconductors are the subject of deep national security anxieties. They’re a foundational technology of modern life, not just in obviously digital devices but in everything from cars to military equipment. Over half the world’s chip-making capacity — and far more for the most advanced designs — is in Taiwan, which faces growing pressure from mainland China, itself an increasingly powerful player in the industry. As of 2020, according to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association, the U.S. had 12 percent of global manufacturing capacity.
The new venture group has strong ties both in Washington and on Wall Street. It leads what the White House has described as “an independent consortium of investors” across the Quad, the China-countering security partnership between the U.S., Japan, India and Australia. The fund’s C.E.O., Gilman Louie, is a former video games executive turned venture capitalist who led In-Q-Tel, a C.I.A.-backed venture fund. He was recently named to President Biden’s Intelligence Advisory Board and is expected to testify before senators on strengthening supply chains.
The fund has raised more than a few eyebrows. Its backers have a lot of other potentially connected interests. Schmidt has been criticized for having too much influence in the Biden and Obama administrations; Thiel was thought to have Trump’s ear. “I’m not sure what that organization can accomplish that the U.S. government can’t accomplish itself,” said Gaurav Gupta, an emerging tech analyst at the industry research firm Gartner.
But the fund’s Louie said the skepticism wasn’t warranted: “If anything, we need more Eric Schmidts to get involved, not stand on the sidelines,” he said. “We need more technologists who have influence.”

At stake is U.S. primacy in the global innovation race. The risk of inaction, industry experts say, is that China’s recent tech investments will put Chinese technology, and perhaps even ideology, in first place. “In our current trajectory, the U.S. is losing its grip,” said Edlyn Levine, a quantum physicist and one of the fund’s founders. She added, “Whoever leads has a first mover advantage and actually will dominate in that sector the same way the United States did in early semiconductors.”
Is this the right group to help build up chip capacity? That’s a question being asked by the fund’s skeptics. The founders say they are committed, whether or not they get federal funding, and they have also started a related fund raising money from nonprofits. “I don’t need the government to give us permission to go save the country,” Louie said. “It’d be nice if they would help us.”

The U.S.’s top antitrust cop is ready for action  
Nearly a year into her job as chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan’s record has lacked a signature action against the industry, and she hasn’t made the splash that many expected.

Khan was appointed by President Biden to shake up an agency that has long quivered at the power of the tech giants, but Republican lawmakers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have also fought her at every turn, describing her as anti-business and overbearing. At the F.T.C., staff morale has plummeted, according to a recent survey, and senior officials have left.

That may change now that she has a Democratic majority. Last month, Congress confirmed Alvaro Bedoya as the F.T.C.’s fifth commissioner, giving Democrats 3-2 control of the agency’s leadership. In a 20-minute interview this week with The Times’s Cecilia Kang over Zoom, she said she was preparing to unleash an aggressive agenda and “the best is yet to come.”
Focusing on dominant actors in markets is going to be a priority, she said. “You can expect to see big lawsuits,” she said. “We’re definitely focusing our resources on litigating. With limited resources, we’re having to focus on what we see as some of the biggest problems.”
Asked whether her work could really rein in tech, which often outpaces rule-making and policy, she said that a lot of the work the agency had done had “broadened the aperture” for understanding, recognizing and diagnosing harm. She said her aim was to anticipate problems down the line and take swift action.
“I think this goes back to being attentive to these next-generation technologies and next-generation innovations in nascent industries across sectors,” Khan said. “Those can really help us tackle problems at the inception.”

A key focus for Khan is reviewing merger guidelines. These are internal rules that the F.T.C. follows in its reviews of mergers alongside the Justice Department. Khan said these rules needed to be “fully adhering to existing law” while also accurately reflecting the ways companies “illegally acquire” power to fend off competition. “We’re going to continue enforcing the law vigorously, prohibiting illegal mergers, prohibiting unlawful business practices,” she said.

A new low-interest loan for U.S. immigrants
In the long, long road to U.S. citizenship, immigrants face hefty financial obstacles. All in, including green card, application for citizenship, legal fees and payments for processors, at least one estimate puts the cost of citizenship at as much as $11,000.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A new program, financed by BlueHub Capital, aims to address that cost. It offers a 1 percent interest loan to immigrants eligible to apply for citizenship. There are nine million immigrants eligible for citizenship in the U.S., BlueHub estimates, but the program has started small. Since it began in March, about 70 people have applied, according to Elyse Cherry, BlueHub’s C.E.O.
“We have built this to be a scalable model, so we expect it to work with thousands and thousands of borrowers,” Cherry told DealBook. “What we’re really trying to do here is to build out a community of immigrants and all of the folks from the country who support them.” The loan has no credit requirements or late or hidden fees.
Many immigrants already take out loans to cover costs associated with the citizenship process, but usually at very high fees. A survey conducted by a group affiliated with BlueHub of more than 1,200 people, found that 90 percent of immigrants borrowed to pay for citizenship. Two-thirds of borrowers said they drew on high-interest financing such as credit cards or payday lenders. A 2018 study by Stanford University researchers found that subsidies could make a significant difference. According to the study, low-income immigrants who received fee vouchers to assist with the application cost naturalized at double the rate of those who did not.
Compared with Canada, Australia and Britain, the percentage of immigrants to the U.S. who become citizens is low. And U.S. naturalization rates have declined markedly between 1970 and 2011, the Stanford study found. This matters because citizenship is associated with economic and social gains, both for individuals and for the places where they live. Gaining legal status generally leads to better job prospects, higher incomes and higher rates of homeownership, research has shown. And that’s on top of all the other rights and benefits of citizenship.
Luiz Sebastião Machado, a 72-year-old from Brazil who fixes vacuum cleaners and other equipment, said he was applying for citizenship using the 1 percent loan so he could have access to social security benefits once he retired.
Adina Appelbaum, a co-founder of financial planning firm Immigrant Finance, told DealBook that access to such a loan would make a significant difference to immigrant families. “One of the primary reasons that immigrants cannot apply for citizenship is the high fees,” she said.

2022-06-12,"Google has settled a class-action lawsuit that accused it of systematically underpaying women, promising to provide $118 million in monetary relief and invite outsiders to review its pay practices.
Three former Google employees first sued the company in 2017 in Ellis v. Google LLC, claiming that it paid women less than men for the same job; a fourth plaintiff was added later. A San Francisco Superior Court judge must now approve the Friday settlement, which covers about 15,500 women employed in California by Google in 236 different job titles since Sept. 14, 2013.
For Google, which prides itself on an egalitarian ethos, the long-running legal dispute was an uncomfortable subject. It coincided with gender discrimination suits against tech peers Microsoft and Oracle that have had mixed results. The women suing the software company Oracle faced a setback Friday, Bloomberg Law reported earlier, when a judge stripped the plaintiffs of their class-action status.
“While we strongly believe in the equity of our policies and practices, after nearly five years of litigation, both sides agreed that resolution of the matter, without any admission or findings, was in the best interest of everyone,” Chris Pappas, a Google spokesman, said in a statement. “We’re very pleased to reach this agreement.” Google has analyzed pay equity over the last nine years and raised employees’ pay when warranted, he added.
For three years after a formal approval of the settlement, Google will let third-party experts assess how it could improve its pay equity process and be fairer when establishing rank and pay for new hires. There will also be an external monitor to assess whether the company is following the experts’ recommendations, according to firms representing the plaintiffs, Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein and Altshuler Berzon.
“As a woman who’s spent her entire career in the tech industry, I’m optimistic that the actions Google has agreed to take as part of this settlement will ensure more equity for women,” Holly Pease, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement."
2022-06-13,"Microsoft and the Communications Workers of America union announced an agreement on Monday that would make it easier for employees to unionize at the video game maker Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is acquiring for $70 billion.
Under the deal, which appears to be the first of its kind in the technology industry, Microsoft agreed to remain neutral if any of Activision’s eligible U.S. employees want to unionize, and employees would no longer have to petition the National Labor Relations Board for an election. The company has almost 7,000 employees in the United States, most of whom will be eligible to unionize under the arrangement.
A group of nearly 30 employees at one of Activision’s studios voted to unionize through an N.L.R.B. election in May despite Activision’s opposition to holding the election. But completing such a process can be time consuming, with unions and employers sometimes spending months or even years litigating the results.
Through the agreement, workers will have access to an expedited process for unionizing, overseen by a neutral third party, in which they will indicate their support for a union either by signing cards or confidentially through an electronic platform.

“This process does gives us and Microsoft a way to do this quote unquote election without spending the time, the effort and the controversy that goes along with an N.L.R.B. election,” Chris Shelton, the president of the Communications Workers union, said in an interview.
The union said that the neutrality agreement resolved the antitrust concerns it had with the acquisition, and that it now supported the deal, which Microsoft has said will close by the end of next June.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
Mr. Shelton and Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, suggested that the deal could pave the way to wider unionization across the company and the industry. “This is a great opportunity for us to work with Chris and the C.W.A. and to learn and innovate,” Mr. Smith said in an interview. Microsoft said it was prepared to “build on” the deal in the future, but did not specifically comment on whether it planned to extend the terms to other gaming workers at the company.
Microsoft indicated that under the agreement, it would refrain from an aggressive anti-union campaign if other Activision employees sought to unionize. “In practical terms, it means that we’re not going to try to jump in and put a thumb on the scale,” Mr. Smith said in the interview. “We will respect the fact that our employees are capable of making decisions for themselves and they have a right to do that.”

Facing their own union campaigns, companies like Amazon and Starbucks have held frequent mandatory meetings with employees to argue that a union could leave them worse off.

The labor board has issued complaints against Amazon that include accusations of threatening workers with a loss of benefits if they unionize, and against Starbucks over accusations that it fired workers who sought to form a union and effectively promised benefits to workers if they chose not to unionize. Both companies have denied the accusations. In a recent case brought by the N.L.R.B. in Arizona, a federal judge denied a request for an injunction to reinstate pro-union workers whom the labor board said Starbucks had forced out illegally.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The agreement between Microsoft and the union would also protect workers’ right to communicate among themselves and with union officials about a union campaign — something many employers seek to discourage — and stipulates that disagreements between the company and the union will be resolved through an “expedited arbitration process.” N.L.R.B. complaints can take months or years to resolve.
When Microsoft and Activision announced their blockbuster deal in January, the game maker was under stress as it faced accusations that senior executives had ignored sexual harassment and discrimination. Those concerns spurred organizing among Activision employees, including workers at its Raven Software studio in Wisconsin, which has developed games in popular franchises like Call of Duty.
After a group of roughly 30 quality assurance, or Q.A., workers announced that they were seeking to unionize, Activision sought to convince the federal labor board that their election should not go forward. The game workers accused Activision of union-busting tactics, like increasing the pay of non-Raven Q.A. workers and splitting Q.A. workers up by embedding them across the Raven studio.

Activision maintained that while some changes in this vein had come after the union campaign went public, the broader shift in approach had already been underway — for example, its move to change the status of hundreds of temporary and contingent workers to permanent full-time employees in the fall.
The company argued that the entire Raven studio, comprising hundreds of workers, should have been allowed to vote on forming a union, rather than just a few dozen Q.A. workers. Q.A. employees, often on temporary contracts, are commonly considered the most overworked and underpaid members of game studios.
In early March, the union signed a letter asking federal regulators to scrutinize the acquisition. “The potential takeover by Microsoft threatens to further undermine workers’ rights and suppress wages,” the letter said.
Microsoft has since tried to strike a conciliatory tone. It said it would not stop Activision from voluntarily recognizing the union before a formal election, which Activision did not do. After the Raven Q.A. workers voted in late May to form the first union at a major North American game publisher, Phil Spencer, the head of gaming at Microsoft, told employees that he would recognize the Raven union once the deal between the two companies closed, the gaming news site Kotaku reported, citing a video of an employee town hall.
Activision said on Friday that it was starting contract negotiations with the newly unionized Raven workers. “We decided to take this important step forward with our 27 represented employees and C.W.A. to explore their ideas and insights for how we might better serve our employees, players and other stakeholders,” Bobby Kotick, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement.

In a blog post this month that appeared to foreshadow the deal, Mr. Smith announced a set of principles to guide Microsoft’s response to labor organizing, an indication that it was taking a more open approach across the company’s businesses.
He wrote that he had observed Microsoft’s successful “collaborative experiences with works councils and unions” while working in Europe and said that in the United States the company would pursue “collaborative approaches that will make it simpler, rather than more difficult, for our employees to make informed decisions and to exercise their legal right to choose whether to form or join a union.”
In the interview, Mr. Smith called the neutrality agreement “our first opportunity to put those principles into practice.”
The Communications Workers of America, which represents employees at companies like AT&T Mobility, Verizon and The New York Times, has sought to organize tech industry workers in recent years. It has begun organizing retail workers at Apple Stores and helped workers at Google form a so-called minority union, which allows them to act together on workplace issues without having to win a union election.
About a dozen retail employees at Google Fiber stores in Kansas City, Mo., who are formally employed by a Google contractor, recently voted to join the union.

U.S. promises $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine
Amid increasingly urgent calls from Ukraine, President Biden yesterday announced an additional $1 billion in weapons and aid for the war-torn country. Overall, the U.S. has now committed about $5.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. Germany, Slovakia, Canada, Poland and the Netherlands have also pledged more artillery. Follow the latest updates.
The promise of additional aid came as the U.S. and its allies sought to present a united front against the Kremlin. The war in Ukraine has radically altered the strategic calculus in Europe. Nearly four months in, some fissures are emerging over the end game of an increasingly intractable conflict as Europe grapples with the economic fallout from the war, including rising inflation and gas prices.
Though the U.S. has said it will not pressure Kyiv into negotiations, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, yesterday said that the conflict would eventually have to end with talks. “At some point, when we will have done our maximum to help Ukraine resist — when, I hope, it will have won and the firing has ceased — we will have to negotiate,” he said.

Fed hikes interest rates
The Federal Reserve yesterday raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in the largest increase since 1994, signaling that it is prepared to inflict economic pain to get inflation under control. The rate increase could be followed by a similarly sized move next month, officials said.
Increasing interest rates will make buying a home or expanding a business more expensive, restraining spending and slowing the broader economy. Officials expect growth to moderate in the coming months and years. Unemployment is forecast to rise about half a percentage point to 4.1 percent by late 2024 as Fed policy squeezes companies and workers.
Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, acknowledged that it was becoming increasingly difficult for the central bank to slow inflation without causing a recession as outside forces, including the war in Ukraine and factory shutdowns in China, threaten to curb the supply of goods and commodities like oil. “The environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months,” he said.
By the numbers: The latest move set the Fed’s policy rate in a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, and more rate increases are to come. Officials expect interest rates to hit 3.4 percent by the end of 2022.

W.H.O. official warns about risks of monkeypox
Dr. Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.’s top official in Europe, yesterday called for urgent action by the authorities and civic groups to control fast-rising cases of monkeypox that he said posed a real risk to public health. More than 1,500 cases have been identified across 25 European countries, accounting for 85 percent of global cases, he said.
“The magnitude of this outbreak poses a real risk,” Dr. Kluge said. “The longer the virus circulates, the more it will extend its reach, and the stronger the disease’s foothold will get in nonendemic countries.” Monkeypox is a viral infection endemic in West Africa, but it has now spread to 39 countries, including 32 that have no previous experience with it.
Infections mostly result from close physical contact, but the virus can also spread through respiratory droplets in prolonged face-to-face contact. The current outbreak has mainly affected men who have sex with men, raising concerns about transmission over a summer of Pride events, music festivals and other mass gatherings. Dr. Kluge said the disease was not a reason to cancel events, but he highlighted the need for awareness.

The fix is in
An explosion of social media stars are teaching followers to flip their furniture — a trend that is perhaps no surprise after a period in which so many people downloaded TikTok to fend off the boredom of being stuck on the couch.
“Flipping,” in this sense, means finding a well-built but aging piece of furniture, refurbishing it — often by sanding, adding fresh paint or varnish and updating its hardware — and reselling it. But many of the people making videos also aim to help viewers improve the furniture already in their homes.
“So many people can’t afford to spend thousands of dollars on furniture,” Christina Clericuzio, a flipper from Connecticut, told The Times. “So it’s fun to show people that they can have these things for less when they D.I.Y.”

2022-06-17,"After the massacre of schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, the gun-control movement was small and badly outspent by the National Rifle Association. Parents seeking an outlet for their grief and rage congregated on Facebook, where they formed their own group, Moms Demand Action, to push for stricter gun laws.
By far the most significant and best-known donor in the years since has been Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York City mayor. In 2013, his mayors’ initiative merged with Moms Demand Action to create Everytown for Gun Safety, the closest thing that the gun-control movement has to a counterweight to the N.R.A. That year the group spent $36.5 million, compared with $4.7 million the year before.
More groups sprang up, including Giffords, started in 2013 by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was nearly killed in a mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., that claimed the lives of six people, and the March for Our Lives, founded by survivors of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla.
As recent progress on a bipartisan gun safety deal on Capitol Hill illustrates, the nascent movement has coalesced into something more formidable. It went from being considered a guaranteed-to-lose issue for Democrats to something candidates organize around, especially on the state level. But because gun control was viewed as particularly divisive, many major philanthropists and big foundations have been reluctant to dive into an issue long seen as not just polarized but intractable.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Yet as gun sales and gun deaths have risen in tandem, and the number of mass shootings continues to increase, including the attacks last month in Buffalo and Uvalde, Texas, big donors have begun to move off the sidelines.
“Since Buffalo I have spoken to a dozen large funders who are quickly scrambling to figure out where they can play a role in the current gun violence crisis,” said David Brotherton, vice chair of the Fund for a Safer Future, the largest national donor collaborative working on gun-violence prevention, and a program officer at the Atlanta philanthropy the Kendeda Fund. “This is snowballing right now.”
In addition to moments of crisis, people were trying to make progress where the potential political heat was lower. More and more funders have tried tackling gun violence through the less politically divisive lens of public health, through community intervention and as a matter of racial equity. Big-name philanthropists including Steve and Connie Ballmer of the Ballmer Group and John and Laura Arnold of Arnold Ventures have begun to make tens of millions of dollars in grants on different aspects of gun-violence prevention.
The gun-control movement is better funded than it was a decade ago, but it still is not outspending the N.R.A. Even with recent legal challenges and boardroom battles, the N.R.A. remains a powerful organization with years of success in blocking legislative efforts to restrict gun sales.
It remains to be seen how the bipartisan deal for a narrow set of gun safety measures, an agreement reached by 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats and endorsed by President Biden, will move through the evenly divided Senate.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Money is also only part of the equation. More donors will help the gun-control movement spend on lobbying, research and organizing, and on donations to political candidates who support the cause. But matching the intensity and discipline of gun-rights supporters’ political activism isn’t just about who spends more.
Gun rights are an especially galvanizing issue for many Republican voters, particularly in primaries, and Republicans have been far more likely to use messaging about guns to excite their base than Democrats have for the bulk of this year, though some are increasingly working gun safety into their pitches now.
“It is a much heavier lift than everybody thinks because in attacking this gun thing, you’re taking on the entire identity and ethos of the G.O.P.,” said Ryan Busse, a former executive at the gun company Kimber who is now an industry critic.
Richard Feldman, a former N.R.A. regional political director, said that the gun-control movement might be better organized and funded than in the past but that the politics of the issue still largely favored gun rights.
“Everyone has an opinion about guns, but, come November, it’s the determining issue for gun owners,” Mr. Feldman said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It is that strength of feeling that helped keep donors away. Liz Dunning, vice president of development at the gun-control group Brady, worked in education nonprofits and philanthropy before switching to gun control. “I know what it looks like when the really big philanthropic players engage, and it looks different from this,” she said.
“What would happen if Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and the Ford Foundation came together and said, ‘We’re not going to live this way anymore, and we’re going to tap the resources that we have right now to make a difference’?” asked Ms. Dunning, whose mother was shot and killed.
But the decade of activism since Sandy Hook has laid the groundwork for change. And the grinding increase in gun violence, not just in high-profile mass shootings but also in domestic violence and suicides, has steadily added to the ranks of small donors and the rolls of volunteers.
According to the legislation tracked by the group Giffords, since the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012, 48 states and the District of Columbia have passed more than 466 gun laws. That includes 22 states that have closed the federal loophole that exempted unlicensed sellers from conducting background checks on some or all firearms purchasers.

“In some cases Congress is the curtain-raiser, and in others it’s the finale. And the truth is, I think it’s going to be the finale here,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, when asked about political will in Washington before the bipartisan gun safety deal was announced. “But if you look at the state-by-state action, that it’s occurred on a bipartisan basis, it shows a pretty remarkable change in political calculus.”

The face of the gun-control movement in the 1980s was James Brady, the White House press secretary who was grievously wounded and permanently disabled when he was shot in 1981 during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. In 1994, Congress passed an assault-weapon ban. After Democrats lost control of the House the same year, guns came to be viewed as a losing issue by many Democrats.
“You had all these centrists in the ’90s who thought guns are the third rail. You can’t do anything about it. You can’t talk about it. Since Newtown, the consensus changed,” said Alex Barrio, director of advocacy for gun violence prevention policy at the Center for American Progress.
The advent of online organizing helped to narrow the N.R.A.’s fund-raising edge. “The ease and the rise of online portals has made a huge difference. Back in the day you had to direct mail, which is a very expensive way to raise money,” said Josh Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.
But the N.R.A. still outspent gun-violence prevention groups on lobbying in Washington with a record $15.8 million in 2021, a factor of five to one, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics.

“It is incontrovertible that gun rights continue to outspend gun control at least at the national level,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director at OpenSecrets. “The gap is certainly closing.”
In 2019, tax records show, the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund raised a record $80.7 million in contributions and grants. That year, Mr. Bloomberg announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. It was also his most generous to date as a philanthropist. His overall giving soared to $3.3 billion from $767 million the year before. According to the group, Mr. Bloomberg gave an extra $35 million at the end of 2019 that was intended for the next year.
Without a major donation from Mr. Bloomberg, the Action Fund raised just $20.3 million in 2020 and ran a $32 million deficit. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment on the timing of his donations to Everytown. Whether it was related to a personal tax bill, his run for president or something else, the organization’s spending wasn’t ultimately affected. The fluctuation does underscore the potential impact of counting too much on one benefactor, said Brian Mittendorf, professor of accounting specializing in nonprofits at the Ohio State University.
“Given the reliance on one donor, the big open question to me is what the plan is for the future,” Mr. Mittendorf said. “Will there be an effort to diversify the revenue stream?”
That would mean more people putting real money into preventing gun violence, which broadly remains a hard sell.

Donors associated with the effective altruism movement, which tries to find the most cost-effective strategies for saving or improving lives, see gun control as costly compared with interventions like mosquito nets to protect against malaria or vaccines to prevent childhood illnesses.
Ms. Dunning, at Brady, pointed to the politics of the issue and a fear among foundations of tackling something they view as polarizing. “In my conversations with smaller-scale foundations, I’ve heard from program officers and others, ‘It’s not one of our strategic priorities.’ ‘Investing in gun-violence prevention makes us nervous,’” she said.
Since the mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde, “I’ve been getting calls from major donors, new donors I’ve never heard from before,” she added, which could herald an increased role for philanthropy in gun violence prevention.
Laurene Powell Jobs’s organization, the Emerson Collective, began giving to gun-violence prevention groups a decade ago, most notably through the nonprofit Chicago CRED. Emerson gives $25 million annually to the group, which does outreach directly to young people in the city who are at risk of shooting or being shot.
This year, the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie, announced more than $20 million in grants to groups working to reduce community gun violence.

Arnold Ventures, the philanthropic arm of the billionaires John and Laura Arnold, started working on gun-violence prevention in 2018, the year of the shooting in Parkland. It made a $20 million gift to start the National Collaborative for Gun Violence Research to try to get data to shape good policy. In 2020, Arnold Ventures also started working on community violence-reduction strategies with an additional $5 million. This month, the group released a new request for proposals for additional research grants.
“So much more needs to be done,” Walter Katz, vice president of criminal justice at Arnold Ventures, said in an interview. “There’s so much work to go around.”"

Monday
HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE (2012) 8 p.m. on TCM. Long before there were dependable treatment options for AIDS, activist groups including AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power and Treatment Action Group were hard at work trying to change the rhetoric surrounding the disease and pushing for solutions that could cut down on AIDS-related deaths. This documentary, directed by David France, uses archival footage from the 1980s to explore the rancor and apathy toward the disease during that period and how work by activist groups helped lead to robust treatments and a deeper understanding of the disease.
NHL STANLEY CUP FINALS (GAME THREE) 8 p.m. on ABC. The Tampa Bay Lightning, the two-time defending champions, will continue facing off against the Colorado Avalanche in Game 3 of the finals. The best-of-seven format means the team that wins four games first wins the cup. If the Lightning takes home that title, it will be the first team to win three consecutive championships since the New York Islanders won four straight cups in 1980-83.
Tuesday
WILD ’N OUT 8 p.m. on VH1. The fate of this sketch-comedy and improv show was uncertain when ViacomCBS fired the show’s host and creator, Nick Cannon, in 2020 for making antisemitic remarks on a podcast — but the network hired him again last year. It is safe to assume that the new, 18th season, which debuts this week, will feature plenty of other faces: Previous guests on the show have included Chance the Rapper, Zendaya and Machine Gun Kelly.

CITIZEN ASHE 9 p.m. on CNN. This documentary on the tennis star Arthur Ashe, a three-time Grand Slam singles title winner who died in 1993, features Ashe’s brother, wife and friends. They discuss Ashe’s experience as a Black man in a white-dominated sport — his ascent to tennis stardom happened during the Jim Crow era — and his career in the context the AIDS epidemic, South African apartheid and civil rights in the United States. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called it an “engrossing, politically astute documentary portrait.”"
2022-06-21,"For years, activists and academics have been raising concerns that facial analysis software that claims to be able to identify a person’s age, gender and emotional state can be biased, unreliable or invasive — and shouldn’t be sold.
Acknowledging some of those criticisms, Microsoft said on Tuesday that it planned to remove those features from its artificial intelligence service for detecting, analyzing and recognizing faces. They will stop being available to new users this week, and will be phased out for existing users within the year.
The changes are part of a push by Microsoft for tighter controls of its artificial intelligence products. After a two-year review, a team at Microsoft has developed a “Responsible AI Standard,” a 27-page document that sets out requirements for A.I. systems to ensure they are not going to have a harmful impact on society.
The requirements include ensuring that systems provide “valid solutions for the problems they are designed to solve” and “a similar quality of service for identified demographic groups, including marginalized groups.”

Before they are released, technologies that would be used to make important decisions about a person’s access to employment, education, health care, financial services or a life opportunity are subject to a review by a team led by Natasha Crampton, Microsoft’s chief responsible A.I. officer.
There were heightened concerns at Microsoft around the emotion recognition tool, which labeled someone’s expression as anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness or surprise.
“There’s a huge amount of cultural and geographic and individual variation in the way in which we express ourselves,” Ms. Crampton said. That led to reliability concerns, along with the bigger questions of whether “facial expression is a reliable indicator of your internal emotional state,” she said.
The age and gender analysis tools being eliminated — along with other tools to detect facial attributes such as hair and smile — could be useful to interpret visual images for blind or low-vision people, for example, but the company decided it was problematic to make the profiling tools generally available to the public, Ms. Crampton said.
In particular, she added, the system’s so-called gender classifier was binary, “and that’s not consistent with our values.”

Microsoft will also put new controls on its face recognition feature, which can be used to perform identity checks or search for a particular person. Uber, for example, uses the software in its app to verify that a driver’s face matches the ID on file for that driver’s account. Software developers who want to use Microsoft’s facial recognition tool will need to apply for access and explain how they plan to deploy it.
Users will also be required to apply and explain how they will use other potentially abusive A.I. systems, such as Custom Neural Voice. The service can generate a human voice print, based on a sample of someone’s speech, so that authors, for example, can create synthetic versions of their voice to read their audiobooks in languages they don’t speak.
Because of the possible misuse of the tool — to create the impression that people have said things they haven’t — speakers must go through a series of steps to confirm that the use of their voice is authorized, and the recordings include watermarks detectable by Microsoft.
“We’re taking concrete steps to live up to our A.I. principles,” said Ms. Crampton, who has worked as a lawyer at Microsoft for 11 years and joined the ethical A.I. group in 2018. “It’s going to be a huge journey.”

Microsoft, like other technology companies, has had stumbles with its artificially intelligent products. In 2016, it released a chatbot on Twitter, called Tay, that was designed to learn “conversational understanding” from the users it interacted with. The bot quickly began spouting racist and offensive tweets, and Microsoft had to take it down.

In 2020, researchers discovered that speech-to-text tools developed by Microsoft, Apple, Google, IBM and Amazon worked less well for Black people. Microsoft’s system was the best of the bunch but misidentified 15 percent of words for white people, compared with 27 percent for Black people.
The company had collected diverse speech data to train its A.I. system but hadn’t understood just how diverse language could be. So it hired a sociolinguistics expert from the University of Washington to explain the language varieties that Microsoft needed to know about. It went beyond demographics and regional variety into how people speak in formal and informal settings.
“Thinking about race as a determining factor of how someone speaks is actually a bit misleading,” Ms. Crampton said. “What we’ve learned in consultation with the expert is that actually a huge range of factors affect linguistic variety.”
Ms. Crampton said the journey to fix that speech-to-text disparity had helped inform the guidance set out in the company’s new standards.

“This is a critical norm-setting period for A.I.,” she said, pointing to Europe’s proposed regulations setting rules and limits on the use of artificial intelligence. “We hope to be able to use our standard to try and contribute to the bright, necessary discussion that needs to be had about the standards that technology companies should be held to.”
A vibrant debate about the potential harms of A.I. has been underway for years in the technology community, fueled by mistakes and errors that have real consequences on people’s lives, such as algorithms that determine whether or not people get welfare benefits. Dutch tax authorities mistakenly took child care benefits away from needy families when a flawed algorithm penalized people with dual nationality.
Automated software for recognizing and analyzing faces has been particularly controversial. Last year, Facebook shut down its decade-old system for identifying people in photos. The company’s vice president of artificial intelligence cited the “many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society.”
Several Black men have been wrongfully arrested after flawed facial recognition matches. And in 2020, at the same time as the Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Amazon and Microsoft issued moratoriums on the use of their facial recognition products by the police in the United States, saying clearer laws on its use were needed.
Since then, Washington and Massachusetts have passed regulation requiring, among other things, judicial oversight over police use of facial recognition tools.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ms. Crampton said Microsoft had considered whether to start making its software available to the police in states with laws on the books but had decided, for now, not to do so. She said that could change as the legal landscape changed.
Arvind Narayanan, a Princeton computer science professor and prominent A.I. expert, said companies might be stepping back from technologies that analyze the face because they were “more visceral, as opposed to various other kinds of A.I. that might be dubious but that we don’t necessarily feel in our bones.”
Companies also may realize that, at least for the moment, some of these systems are not that commercially valuable, he said.  Microsoft could not say how many users it had for the facial analysis features it is getting rid of. Mr. Narayanan predicted that companies would be less likely to abandon other invasive technologies, such as targeted advertising, which profiles people to choose the best ads to show them, because they were a “cash cow.”"
2022-06-22,"WASHINGTON — A new examination of how Russia used its cybercapabilities in the first months of the war in Ukraine contains a number of surprises: Moscow conducted more cyberattacks than was realized at the time to bolster its invasion, but more than two-thirds of them failed, echoing its poor performance on the physical battlefield.
However, the study, published by Microsoft on Wednesday, suggested that the government of President Vladimir V. Putin was succeeding more than many expected with its disinformation campaign to establish a narrative of the war favorable to Russia, including making the case that the United States was secretly producing biological weapons inside Ukraine.
The report is the latest effort by many groups, including American intelligence agencies, to understand the interaction of a brutal physical war with a parallel — and often coordinated — struggle in cyberspace. It indicated that Ukraine was well prepared to fend off cyberattacks, after having endured them for many years. That was at least in part because of a well-established system of warnings from private-sector companies, including Microsoft and Google, and preparations that included moving much of Ukraine’s most important systems to the cloud, onto servers outside Ukraine.
The account of Russia’s cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns showed that only 29 percent of the attacks breached the targeted networks — in Ukraine, the United States, Poland and the Baltic nations. But it points to a more successful effort underway to dominate the information war, in which Russia has blamed Washington and Kyiv for starting the conflict that is now raging in Ukraine’s east and south.
The war is the first full-scale battle in which traditional and cyberweapons have been used side by side, and the race is on to explore the never-before-seen dynamic between the two. So far, very little of that dynamic has developed as expected."

Netflix’s next move
Reed Hastings, Netflix’s co-founder, once dismissed the idea of putting ads on the streaming service as a nonstarter. Then, this year, the company posted its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, causing its stock to nosedive. Now, the company is talking to Comcast and Google to help it with the details of a plan to bring an ad-supported offering to its service, The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday.
Ben Mullin, a media reporter for The Times, says the advertising plan could create significant upside for Netflix, even if it raises questions in Hollywood. Here are his thoughts:
Ads could funnel more than $1 billion of high-margin revenue to the streaming service annually, according to some analyst reports. And it could do that in a relatively short time frame: Netflix executives have told employees that they plan to start advertising on the service sometime in the final three months of this year. That’s crucial at a time when Wall Street is putting additional pressure on video-streaming businesses to increase profitability after tolerating years of profligate spending.
Nonetheless, Hollywood execs have questions about an ad-supported Netflix offering: Will content producers get a cut of the revenue that Netflix generates by selling ads against their movies and TV shows? Will directors with final cut privileges get a chance to negotiate with Netflix over which commercials are inserted, and when? And will advertisers get a detailed readout of viewer behavior from Netflix, which has been accused of being stingy with user data? Do Netflix’s existing licensing deals with producers even allow the streamer to show commercials alongside their content?
Ed Lee, another media watcher at The Times, says Netflix is making the move out of necessity, not opportunity.
The real reason Netflix is in a hurry to get its ad-based service up and running: Growth has slowed. And the streamer doesn’t have the technology, the sales staff or the Rolodex to cut any deals. So it can’t do it on its own.
Netflix could end up cannibalizing a big chunk of its current customer base. Earlier this month, analysts at Wells Fargo predicted that a cheaper, ad-supported Netflix offering would attract just over 100 million subscribers by the end of 2025. But only 16 million of those customers would be new users — the Wells Fargo analysts believe nearly 85 percent of the users of Netflix’s cheaper service will be existing subscribers looking to pay less for streaming.
In the end, Hollywood might balk. It’s hard to imagine Martin Scorsese is happy to hear his films could be fronted by an ad for … anything. And, as Ben says, Hollywood execs are already asking questions about what’s in it for them. Netflix could have to renegotiate some of its licensing agreements. For new deals, producers would either want a cut of ad revenue or just more money up front.
For now, Netflix isn’t saying much about its plans. A Netflix spokeswoman said yesterday: “We are still in the early days of deciding how to launch a lower-priced, ad-supported option, and no decisions have been made. So this is all just speculation at this point.”
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Jay Powell, the Fed chair, says a recession is “certainly a possibility.” Powell said the Fed might be able to slow inflation without tipping America into a painful downturn. But successfully executing a so-called soft landing “has been made significantly more challenging by the events of the past few months,” he said, citing supply disruptions that have pushed prices higher. He will appear before the House Financial Services Committee today.
Support for a bipartisan gun reform measure in the Senate reflects a political shift. Fourteen Republicans — including Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader — broke with their party to advance the legislation. Only two are up for re-election this year, and most Republicans are expected to oppose the bill.
Russia is ramping up hacking attacks on Ukraine’s allies, Microsoft researchers say. About 128 targets in 42 countries have been hit by Kremlin-directed cyberattacks since the war began, with the U.S. topping the list, they say. The increase in attacks was expected, but they have been less successful than security experts initially predicted.

Altria’s burning question
Shares of Altria, the Marlboro maker, were hit yesterday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Food and Drug Administration would order Juul Labs to take its e-cigarettes off the U.S. market. Altria paid nearly $13 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul in 2018, and the Marlboro maker had already written down its investment in Juul by at least $11 billion. Yesterday’s news could render that stake worthless or close to it — and leave a huge question mark on the tobacco giant’s future.

E-cigarettes were once the next big thing. Big Tobacco, facing slowing sales of traditional cigarettes, jumped right in. R.J. Reynolds introduced Vuse. The e-cigarette start-up Njoy got backing from high-profile investors like Sean Parker, of Napster and Facebook fame, and the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
But as Juul’s sales skyrocketed, especially among teens, the F.D.A. became concerned. That led to a 2018 regulatory crackdown. That’s when Juul turned to Altria for funding, as well as some regulatory muscle, instead of trying to fund-raise $20 billion from venture capital firms. In 2020, the agency mandated e-cigarette makers get approval to stay on the U.S. market, which it now appears Juul will not get. An appeal is probable. Juul conducts a majority of its business in the U.S. and reportedly had a net loss last year of $259 million.
This could leave Altria in a world of trouble. Its core product is under fire, with the F.D.A. looking to significantly reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes. Altria gets about 90 percent of its revenue from smokable products. Its revenue fell slightly last year, according to regulatory filings, and its stock is down more than 45 percent in the past five years. Other attempts to diversify, like an investment in the cannabis company Cronos, have similarly faltered: Altria wrote down that investment by $200 million at the end of last year. Might Altria look to make a big play outside cigarettes — say food or snacking, given its huge distribution in convenience stores? Pass the popcorn.

The N.F.L. and toxic workplaces
Professional football teams are not your typical everyday employers. But their visibility means they should be setting an example for how to handle issues like bullying, harassment and intimidation, says Representative Carolyn Maloney, the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Instead, some have fallen far short of that.
At a hearing yesterday, Maloney said the N.F.L. secretly agreed to withhold evidence that Dan Snyder, the owner of the Washington Commanders, had fostered a “notoriously toxic workplace.” Maloney, Democrat of New York, said the league’s failures had compelled her to introduce two new bills intended to protect all workers: “What happens in the N.F.L. has consequences for the rest of the country.” (A representative for Snyder said the committee’s investigation was “predetermined from the beginning,” adding that the team addressed workplace issues “years ago.”)
The proposals would limit nondisclosure agreements and protect worker privacy. The committee began investigating the N.F.L.’s handling of misconduct claims and subsequent investigations in the fall. It found that Snyder relied on bullying and intimidation and treated men and women unequally. The Commanders, for example, fired a female cheerleader who had a consensual sexual relationship with a player, who kept his job. Footage of cheerleaders was also said to have been turned into a personal video for Snyder, an accusation he and others deny. One of the bills introduced by Maloney outlines processes for handling misconduct claims and bans settlements that prevent transparency. The other requires consent to capture employee images and prohibits illegitimate uses.

Will the bills pass? Republicans acknowledge that bullying is a serious problem, but they say that private companies are not under the committee’s jurisdiction, and that Congress should focus on inflation and the economy. The top Republican on the committee, Representative James Comer of Kentucky, protested that an “overhaul” at the Commanders had already begun. The likelihood of passage may be slim, given the vociferous resistance.
Workplace toxicity can also be an economic issue. A McKinsey report on employee mental health across 15 countries says companies “pay a high price for failure to address workplace factors that strongly correlate with burnout, such as toxic behavior.” Toxicity was the biggest predictor of attrition, researchers found. Dissatisfaction with bad management has helped drive the “Great Resignation,” with corporate culture ranked more than 10 times as important to workers than compensation, based on an analysis of Glassdoor reviews by other researchers. Companies are increasingly offering programs for worker wellness while leaving fundamental problems unaddressed, McKinsey researchers wrote: “As an employer, you can’t ‘yoga’ your way out of these challenges.”

2022-06-24,"Companies had more than a month to formulate a response to the end of federal abortion rights in the United States, if they didn’t weigh in immediately after a draft opinion was leaked in May.
But when the final decision arrived in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization on Friday, relatively few had anything to say about the outcome.
Most stayed silent, including some companies that are known for speaking out on social issues such as Black Lives Matter and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Some of the corporations that blacked out their Instagram pages in 2020 or featured rainbow flags on their websites for Pride Month have so far been hesitant to comment on abortion.
“Executives are feeling some trepidation around this,” said Dave Fleet, the head of global digital crisis at Edelman, a consulting firm. “They’re concerned about backlash because they know there’s no way to please everyone.”

Many of the businesses that did make public statements on Friday opted to address the way the Supreme Court’s decision would affect their workers’ access to health care. In some cases they avoided the word “abortion” altogether, perhaps aiming for a more palatable response.
“We have processes in place so that an employee who may be unable to access care in one location has affordable coverage for receiving similar levels of care in another location,” Disney executives wrote in a memo to staff, adding that this included “family planning (including pregnancy-related decisions).”

Other companies that came forward Friday to say they would cover employee travel expenses for abortions include Warner Bros., Condé Nast, BuzzFeed, Vox Media, Goldman Sachs, Snap, Macy’s, Intuit and Dick’s Sporting Goods. They joined a group including Starbucks, Tesla, Yelp, Airbnb, Netflix, Patagonia, DoorDash, JPMorgan Chase, Levi Strauss & Co., PayPal, OKCupid, Citigroup, Kroger, Google, Microsoft, Paramount, Nike, Chobani, Lyft and Reddit that had previously put in effect similar policies. (Google also told employees that they could “apply for relocation without justification.”)
“The employer is the way a lot of people access the health care system,” Mr. Fleet added. “You’re seeing companies look inwardly first.”

A few companies accompanied those policy changes with statements. Roger Lynch, the head of Condé Nast, called the decision “a crushing blow to reproductive rights.” Lyft said the ruling “will hurt millions of women.” BuzzFeed’s chief executive, Jonah Peretti, called it “regressive and horrific.” Some business leaders spoke out too, with Bill Gates, the co-founder and former head of Microsoft, calling the ruling “an unjust and unacceptable setback,” and Sheryl Sandberg, the departing chief operating officer of Meta, writing that it “threatens to undo the progress women have made in the workplace.”
But many companies that have spoken out on social issues like racism did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment after the Supreme Court’s decision, including Target, Walmart, Coca-Cola, Delta and Wendy’s. Hobby Lobby, which in 2014 brought a successful suit to the Supreme Court challenging whether employer-provided health care had to include contraception, declined to comment on the Dobbs decision.
In recent years there has been a growing expectation that companies weigh in on political and social issues. The share of online American adults who believe that companies have a responsibility to participate in debates about current issues has risen in the past year, according to the consumer research company Forrester. The expectation is even more pronounced among younger social media users, according to research from Sprout Social.
When George Floyd was killed by the police in 2020, public companies and their foundations committed over $49 billion to fighting racial inequality. Last year, after Georgia’s Republican-led legislature restricted voter access, some chief executives, including from Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, criticized the law, and 72 Black business leaders published a letter urging corporate leaders to “publicly oppose any discriminatory legislation.”
With abortion, public opinion is a little different: Forrester found that fewer respondents believed companies should take a stance on abortion. Polls have consistently found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, but a recent survey by Pew Research Center found that people have wide-ranging views about morality on the issue. Companies fear the backlash that could come from taking a stance on the issue.

“When it comes to the range of politicized issues within the sphere of a brand’s impact, few are as divisive and deeply personal as abortion” said Mike Proulx, a vice president and research director at Forrester.

Political engagement is rarely a straightforward choice for company leaders. Disney, which had long avoided partisan politics, faced internal backlash this year when it didn’t take a strong stance on Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law, but then Florida lawmakers revoked its special tax benefits when it did. John Gibson, the chief executive of the gaming company Tripwire Interactive, was swiftly replaced after speaking out in favor of Texas’ ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy.
A 2020 study of 149 firms published in the Journal of Marketing found that corporate activism had a negative effect on a company’s stock market performance, though it found a positive effect on sales if the activism was consistent with the values of the company’s consumers.
Both engaging and deciding not to engage can come at a price.
“You’ve got to be careful not to take the wrong lessons from some of those moments,” said Mr. Fleet, of Edelman. “It would be very easy to look at companies that made missteps and say ‘well, we shouldn’t say anything,’ whereas in fact some clients not saying anything is the mistake that was made.”

Some companies warned staff on Friday to be careful how they discuss the ruling in the workplace. “There will be an intense amount of public debate over this decision,” Citigroup’s head of human resources wrote to staff. “Please remember that we must always treat each other respectfully, even when our opinions differ.”
Meta said publicly on Friday that it would reimburse employees for travel expenses to get abortions. But the company then told its workers not to openly discuss the court’s ruling on wide-reaching communication channels inside the company, according to three employees, citing a policy that put “strong guardrails around social, political and sensitive conversations” in the workplace.
But there are other companies that haven’t shied away from more full-throated statements on abortion, and they are urging other businesses to match their tone and commitment.
OkCupid sent a notification to app users in states with abortion restrictions encouraging them to contact their elected officials in support of abortion. Melissa Hobley, its global chief marketing officer, has been working behind the scenes to get other women business leaders to make commitments to support abortion.
“We had to say screw the risk,” she said. “This is an economic problem, this is a marketing problem. If you’re in highly visible, highly competitive industries like tech, law, finance, you are all fighting after female talent.”

Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, said he felt that it was important to speak out about abortion access whether or not there was a business case for doing so, though he knew that there would be users who opposed that decision.
“Certainly when you speak out on these issues not everyone is going to agree,” he said. “As we looked at this, we felt quite strongly that it was the right thing to do,” adding, “it’s been 50 years of settled law.”

Some business leaders said they were concerned about how abortion restrictions will affect their ability to recruit workers, especially those whose companies are based in the 13 states that will ban abortion immediately or very quickly with Roe overturned. Those states include Texas, where tech companies have flocked in recent years.
Research commissioned by the Tara Health Foundation found that two-thirds of college-educated workers surveyed would be discouraged from taking a job in Texas because of its restrictive abortion law and would not apply for jobs in other states that passed similar laws.

“Employers like us may be the last line of defense,” said Sarah Jackel, chief operating officer of Civitech, a 55-person company based in Texas that builds technology tools for political campaigns. The company committed to covering travel expenses for employees in need of an abortion immediately after the passage of Texas’ ban, S.B. 8.
Ms. Jackel said the policy had strong support from both employees and investors, though the company declined to share if anyone had used it.
“It makes good business sense,” she added. “There’s no reason we should be putting our employees in the position of having to choose between keeping their job or carrying out an unwanted pregnancy.”

2022-06-27,"Even as more companies have become outspoken on social causes, the reaction by corporate America on Friday after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade was relatively muted.
In response to the court’s ruling, which ended federal abortion rights, several companies released statements reaffirming their commitment to helping employees access health care services they may not be able to obtain in their state.
Companies in May had begun creating policies on covering travel expenses for employees who need abortions, after a leaked memo from Supreme Court justices previewed their decision on the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The group included Starbucks, Tesla, Yelp, Airbnb, Microsoft, Netflix, Patagonia, DoorDash, JPMorgan Chase, Levi Strauss & Co., PayPal and Reddit. Others, including Disney, Meta, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Condé Nast, joined them on Friday when the decision became final. Most have avoided making public statements directly referencing the ruling.
With abortion rights now overturned on the federal level, there is more pressure for companies to respond, especially for those with headquarters in one of the 13 states that have measures in place to ban abortion immediately or very quickly.
Here’s a sampling of what companies have said in response to the Supreme Court decision:

Johnson & Johnson: “As the world’s most broadly based health care company, we strive to improve access and affordability, create healthier communities, and put health within reach for the people we serve.” It added, “We also believe health care decisions are best determined by individuals in consultation with their health care provider.”
JPMorgan Chase: The country’s largest bank said it was focused on equal access to health care for all its employees. A spokeswoman highlighted a June 1 memo alerting employees that their travel costs would be covered if they needed to go more than 50 miles to receive certain medical procedures, including abortions.
Levi Strauss & Co.: “Protection of reproductive rights is a critical business issue impacting our work force, our economy and progress toward gender and racial equity,” the company said. “Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard.”
Reddit: The company said its employees could get a stipend to cover travel for procedures such as abortions. “Our benefits programs are designed to support the health and safety of our employees, and we also have robust policies to support women in the workplace,” a representative said.

The men profiting from demand for Plan B
Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, many women have been rushing to stock up on emergency contraception pills, in hopes of exerting more control over their bodies, or because they’re worried that the products could be restricted. (Birth control remains legal across the United States.) Drugstores have found themselves in short supply of the pills, and some are limiting purchases.
The uptick in demand could add up to huge profits for the two private equity firms behind the most well-known morning-after pill, Plan B. It might also put Plan B in the middle of the abortion rights fight.
The all-male teams of investors behind Plan B are poised to make big bucks. According to the websites of the two private equity firms, Kelso and Juggernaut, only men make up the teams overseeing the maker of the top-selling emergency contraception in the United States. And their paydays could be big. One dose of brand-name Plan B typically sells for around $46. And it’s probably quite profitable: It had a more than 85 percent profit margin when it was sold as a prescription drug by Barr, said David Woodburn, a former analyst who covered the company. (Neither firm responded to DealBook’s requests for comment about the gender makeup of their teams.)
Plan B’s maker had exclusive marketing rights for three years after the F.D.A. extended the medication’s over-the-counter use to all ages in 2013. That exclusivity plays a big role in how well-known the brand is. The brand has competition from cheaper generic versions, but women often prefer familiar brands of health products like emergency contraception, analysts say. Teva, which acquired Barr, sold Plan B to Kelso and Juggernaut in 2017 for $675 million. The firms run Plan B through Foundation Consumer Healthcare, a company that owns several over-the-counter brands, including the cold medicine Dimetapp.
The language on the emergency pill’s packaging could pave the way for its restriction. Plan B works mainly by stopping the release of an egg from the ovaries. But some believe that its maker had to use certain wording to get it approved by the F.D.A. in 2006 for over-the-counter use. As such, Plan B’s label says it may also prevent a fertilized embryo from attaching to the uterus. That distinction matters, because some states argue that a fertilized embryo is a person, which could create grounds for banning Plan B.  To prevent that, Foundation Consumer and its owners could ask the F.D.A. for an updated label, but that could put the firms in the middle of political cross hairs they would probably rather avoid.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Ernst & Young is fined $100 million over exam cheating. The S.E.C. handed out its largest fine against an auditing firm after finding that some auditors had cheated on ethics exams. “It’s simply outrageous that the very professionals responsible for catching cheating by clients cheated on ethics exams,” said Gurbir Grewal, the commission’s director of enforcement.
The Group of 7 leaders agree to seek price caps on Russian oil. As Russia’s revenue from oil remains high, officials from the G7 agreed to the temporary move as a way to slow down President Vladimir Putin’s war machine. The group will also pledge to spend $4.5 billion this year to counter global food shortages caused by the invasion of Ukraine.
At least 46 migrants are found dead in San Antonio in and around an abandoned tractor-trailer. It appeared to be one of the worst episodes of migrant death in the U.S. in recent years. Officials suggested extreme heat had contributed to the deaths of the migrants, who are believed to have crossed into the country from Mexico.
China eases its quarantine rules for international arrivals. China’s economy has endured months of uncertainty because of the country’s strict Covid rules, but the Shanghai stock market jumped on the news that the mandated time in a quarantine facility will drop to a week, half the current requirement.

Checking the receipts
Several companies have pledged to help employees travel across state lines for abortions since it first became apparent that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade. But many of those firms have also donated to political campaigns that actively worked to undercut Roe. The journalist Dan Rather asked which supportive companies “also gave money to senators who voted to confirm the justices who gutted this constitutional right?”
DealBook checked the records, and at least 11 companies that are offering to cover employees’ abortion-related travel expenses — Citigroup, Disney, Goldman Sachs, Google, Intuit, JPMorgan Chase, Meta/Facebook, Microsoft, PayPal, Salesforce, and Yelp — also gave to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helped elect some of the lawmakers who confirmed the conservative justices appointed by President Donald Trump. Their contributions via company political action committees, which gather employee donations, totaled about $440,000 from 2017 to the present, filings with the Federal Election Commission show.

The companies respond: A Yelp spokeswoman noted that the company gives to both Democrats and Republicans. An Intuit spokesman said its PAC was nonpartisan. A PayPal spokeswoman said its PAC had not made a political contribution since 2020. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. Google, Facebook and Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and Salesforce did not comment in time for publication.
Companies are big political spenders. “Leading public companies and their trade associations have been the dominant donors to the Republican Attorneys General Association and the Republican State Leadership Committee and, to a slightly lesser degree, to the Republican Governors Association,” said Bruce Freed of the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit group. Members of those Republican groups have worked to restrict abortion rights. The dating site company Match Group established a fund to cover costs associated with severe abortion restrictions in Texas last year, but as Popular Information reported, the company also gave $137,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association, arguably undermining the rights of the women it now promises to support.

Pointing an arrow at Robinhood?
Last month, the crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried bought nearly 8 percent of Robinhood, the app-based brokerage firm. Now, he’s reportedly considering an offer for the whole shebang.
Bloomberg reported yesterday that FTX — which has been on a mini-acquisition spree as crypto prices have crashed — has held internal discussions on whether it makes sense to buy Robinhood. Shares of the once-hot brokerage firm rose 14 percent on the news, but are still down 80 percent from their I.P.O. price. At the current market cap, FTX could buy the rest of Robinhood for just $7 billion.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Bankman-Fried said yesterday that “there are no active M&A conversations with Robinhood.” But in a statement later in the day to DealBook and others, he said he was “excited about Robinhood’s prospects,” and thought the two firms could work together. That leaves the door open to a deal, and raises some questions.
How would a deal get done? Investors valued FTX, headquartered in the Bahamas, at $32 billion earlier this year. But does FTX really want to be within reach of U.S. regulators? It has a sister company, FTX.US, based in San Francisco, that has a much lower valuation. On his own, Bankman-Fried is worth around $20 billion, according to Forbes. How much of that is he willing to risk on Robinhood?
Would FTX change Robinhood’s commission-free business model? Much of Robinhood’s revenue comes from payment for order flow, a contentious Wall Street trading practice that the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to at least partly eliminate. Last month, FTX started a trial of its own commission-free stock brokerage firm, and has vowed not to do any deals involving payment for order flow. Perhaps FTX’s crypto trading business is profitable enough that it can use Robinhood’s stock trades as a loss leader?
What would happen if Robinhood’s meme-stock-heavy trading business mixed with FTX’s crypto volatility? “It’s a recipe for problems,” said Paul Rowady, director of research at the brokerage technology consulting firm Alphacution. He said allowing FTX customers to fund their Robinhood accounts to buy GameStop and similar stocks would be layering volatility on top of volatility. “My thought bubble for SBF would be, ‘Don’t do it,’” Rowady said, referring to Bankman-Fried.
“It’s a doomsday scenario if individuals have to bring their health care choices to their employers.”

New York’s wealth exodus
The hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who left the city during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic drained it of $21 billion in taxable income, according to IRS filings received in 2020 and 2021.
New York City relies heavily on its wealthiest residents to support schools, law enforcement and other public services. The outflow of about 300,000 residents was the biggest in the city’s records, The Times’s Nicole Hong and Matthew Haag report, and it will have long-term effects.
The top 1 percent of the city’s earners, who make more than $804,000 a year, contributed 41 percent of New York City’s personal income taxes in 2019.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The city’s outlook could be grim. It collected more tax revenue in both 2020 and 2021 than it did in 2019, thanks in part to at least $16 billion in federal pandemic aid. But many forms of stimulus have now ended. And the loss of in-person workers has caused the market value of office buildings to plunge during the pandemic, prompting a sharp decline in property tax revenue.
New Yorkers’ exodus to Florida was especially stark. The pandemic accelerated the relocation of several New York-based financial firms to new offices or headquarters in Florida, including the hedge fund Elliott Management. The firm’s co-chief executive, Jonathan Pollock, is now a full-time Florida resident, according to records obtained by The Times.

2022-07-01,"Technoblade, a YouTube personality who built a following of millions with his wry commentary on videos of himself playing Minecraft, has died, his father announced in a video posted on his son’s account.
More than 11 million subscribers made a habit of watching screen recordings of Technoblade’s Minecraft gameplay as he provided commentary off camera. While he usually focused on what was happening in the game, in some videos he described life events as mundane as going to the D.M.V. or as devastating as receiving a cancer diagnosis.
A video titled “so long nerds,” which was posted on Technoblade’s YouTube channel on Thursday and has been viewed more than 26 million times as of Friday afternoon, departed from the channel’s usual aesthetic of colorful, pixelated bricks. Instead, a man who identifies himself as Technoblade’s father appears, sitting in a chair against a stark white background with a small white dog in his lap.
His father, who does not give his name, reads a message from his son that begins: “Hello, everyone. Technoblade here. If you are watching this, I am dead.”
The message goes on to reveal Technoblade’s first name, Alex, which he did not use online. The video also features a handful of photos of Alex with loved ones. He had rarely shown himself in his YouTube videos, preferring instead to present himself as his avatar: a crowned, sword-wielding pig.
“If I had another hundred lives, I think I would choose to be Technoblade again every single time,” Alex’s letter says. “Those were the happiest years of my life.”
His father, who remains emotional throughout the video, says he and his son talked for months about whether to record a final video. Instead, Alex decided to write the letter and died about eight hours after finishing it, his father says.
“I don’t think he said everything he wanted to say, but I think he got the main points,” he says.
The video ends with a written statement attributed to Alex’s mother, who is not named. She wrote that her son avoided personal fame and was self-deprecating, even as his channel skyrocketed in popularity.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“From Technoblade’s earliest online days, he was always strategizing ways to delight and reward his audience, giving away online prizes, encouraging good sportsmanship and, most of all, sharing his Minecraft adventures for entertainment and laughs,” she wrote.
Alex’s family could not be reached on Friday. Hypixel, a gaming company that worked with Technoblade, said the family had asked that requests for comment not be forwarded to them. “The video they shared contains all information they are comfortable sharing at this time,” Don Pireso, the company’s lead administrator, said in a Twitter direct message.
Alex first publicly acknowledged his cancer diagnosis in a video posted on his channel in August. Like the others, the video showed the game while he spoke off camera. He retained his self-deprecating, humorous style, refusing to get too earnest. He also revealed his age at the time, 22.
In the video, he described how the first round of chemotherapy left him so exhausted that he could barely sit up for a virtual doctor’s appointment. Then, he joked: “Sitting in a chair, am I Superman?”
He said he was diagnosed after experiencing serious pain in his arm. He initially dismissed it as a repetitive stress injury from playing video games, but even after a few days of rest, he said, his shoulder “was swelling like crazy.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
He also implored people to get a Covid-19 vaccine, saying that the cancer treatments had weakened his immune system, putting him at greater risk of serious illness from the coronavirus.
“I’m going to go ahead and speak on behalf of all cancer patients when I say it is incredibly annoying when the hospitals are getting overworked by people dying of preventable diseases,” he said in the video. “I’m just saying, we’ve got dibs on those hospital beds.”
On social media, Technoblade’s friends and fans praised him for his humor and for being a role model among Minecraft players.
Minecraft is unlike most games because its owner, Microsoft, does not control the servers where players meet online. Players can instead create their own servers or join one made by someone else, creating a sprawling network of worlds in the Minecraft universe.
Hypixel, which runs a network of Minecraft servers, said it had created a digital memorial book for people to write messages that would be printed and sent to Technoblade’s family. The company’s tribute featured an illustration of Technoblade’s pig avatar as a statue. “In many ways, the success of many of us is tied to the success of Technoblade,” the company said.

One of Technoblade’s friends, the YouTuber Thomas Simons, better known as TommyInnit, described him on Twitter as a “legend.”
“I just know,” Mr. Simons wrote, “he’s strategizing in heaven on how to beat God.”

Re “America the Merciless,” by Pamela Paul (column, June 27):
Ms. Paul asks how we could have become such a cruel and merciless country when the majority of us favor compassion and mercy. The answer is that this country isn’t set up on the basis of majority rule.
We have small rural states with two senators that together have more voting power than large urban states, also with two senators. We have an Electoral College system that favors small rural states. We have a Republican Party that has become more and more authoritarian, violent and vindictive. We have a Democratic Party that is chronically unable to stand up to bullies.
I share Ms. Paul’s hope that the good we have will overcome the evil in us.

Essays like this one from Pamela Paul are decidedly unhelpful in describing our country, since for every instance she cites there are many others that demonstrate our neighborliness and generosity. For example, the same country of unmatched gun violence is unmatched in charitable donations.
America is not merciless; America has problems like every other country. This compulsion to indict its character is too common among the left and may be acceptable in the academy, but it grates outside the ivy walls.

Re “Questioning Safety Tech in Schools” (Business, June 27):
As noted in this article, there is little hard evidence that any of the vast array of electronic gadgetry promoted by the tech industry to school districts will, as advertised, reduce the likelihood of future school-based rampage shootings. Nevertheless, the industry continues to invest huge sums of money in its lobbying campaigns to promote this patently false claim.
Tragically, the billions of dollars reaped by this industry are being diverted from less expensive essential school needs such as after-school and tutoring programs, repairing failing infrastructures and effective violence prevention strategies.

In fact, four evidence-based strategies have been shown to reduce rates of school violence: programs designed to promote nurturing cultures in schools, social-emotional skills training programs, training in identifying the early warning signs of distressed students, and rigorous methods to assess and address student threats.

Re “Microsoft Vows Neutrality in Activision Union Efforts” (Business, June 14):
The recent neutrality agreement between Microsoft and the Communications Workers of America (C.W.A.) — in which Microsoft agrees not to oppose unionization at a game maker it is acquiring — is extremely significant as an example of the new social contract needed between management and labor in our country.
Instead of seeing the union as the enemy that should be fought, as both Starbucks and Amazon have been doing at significant expense, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, sees the value of unions. Unions enable companies to be innovative and to improve their products and services.
This new social contract between Microsoft and the C.W.A. is an extremely useful approach for other companies and organizations. Creating a collaborative process enables an organization to make use of the skills and knowledge of all employees, not just those in management. This process is vital to strengthen our economy and to deal with the challenges that workplaces now face as a result of the pandemic.

2022-07-06,"There’s a new hard-to-get game console this year that’s not a PlayStation or an Xbox. It’s sold online only. Most casual gamers probably haven’t heard of it.
It’s the $400 Steam Deck, a console as utilitarian as it sounds. The hand-held device, a slab of bulky black plastic with a built-in game controller, has the guts of a supercomputer and a touch screen. It’s as if a gaming computer and a Nintendo Switch had a child.
Valve, the company in Bellevue, Wash., known for its Steam online games store, began taking orders for the Steam Deck last year and the consoles arrived recently. The company has not published sales numbers, but estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands have shipped. People who try to order one today won’t receive the device until the autumn.
In other words, the Steam Deck has become a viable alternative to traditional gaming consoles, unlike Google’s cloud-based gaming platform, Stadia, which was a flop.
The Steam Deck is the result of Valve’s ambitious effort to blend the benefits of modern game devices. That includes gaming-dedicated computers; Nintendo’s hand-held Switch, which focuses on family-friendly games; and Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X, which are living room consoles with faster computing chips for playing more intense games.

The Steam Deck tries to be a jack of all of those trades. It runs Linux, the open-source operating system, which makes it capable of loading a huge swath of new games, including titles made for personal computers and some PlayStation and Xbox games. And just as with a computer, the Steam Deck can be customized to run older games by installing emulation software, which are apps that can run digital copies of games for older consoles.
As someone who grew up with consoles all the way back to the Atari, I decided to give the Steam Deck a try. The verdict: This is the console I recommend for serious gamers who don’t mind doing some tinkering to enjoy games new and old. But it has major flaws, and it’s definitely not for people looking for a plug-and-play experience offered by a traditional game console.
Getting Started
Unlike normal consoles, like PlayStations and Nintendos that can play games stored on discs and cartridges, the Steam Deck is fully digital, meaning it only plays games downloaded over the internet. Gamers will primarily get titles through the Steam app store. So to get started, users set up a Steam account to download games.
From there, there are plenty of options. Gamers can choose from Steam’s library of tens of thousands of games, including popular ones like Counter-Strike and Among Us. Some big titles that were previously exclusive to PlayStation, like Final Fantasy VII: Remake, are also now on Steam.

Those who feel adventurous can move outside of Steam to get more games. This involves switching to desktop mode, which converts the Steam Deck into a miniature Linux computer that can be controlled with a virtual keyboard and a tiny trackpad built into the controller.
Here, you can open a web browser to download some files to set up the Steam Deck to work with Xbox Game Pass to play Xbox games, or to install emulators to run games made for older consoles like the classic Atari from the 1970s and the PlayStation Portable from 2005.
Tinker, if You Dare
In my tests, the Steam Deck was fun to use for playing Steam games. It smoothly ran modern games with intense graphics like Monster Hunter Rise, and the controller, which includes triggers, joysticks and buttons, felt comfortable to use.
But tinkering with it to run games outside of the Steam store was an arduous task, and, at times, maddening. I watched several video tutorials to run EmuDeck, a script that installs emulators on the device. The process took more than an hour. I ultimately had to plug in my own keyboard and mouse because the Steam Deck’s trackpad and keyboard often didn’t register clicks and keystrokes.
Valve said it was still improving desktop navigation and that there were situations where people would need to plug in a keyboard and mouse.
After I finally got emulators running, I had a sweet setup running games new, newish and old, like Vampire Survivors, Persona 4 and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII.

Bottom Line
The Steam Deck lacks the polish and practicality of mainstream gaming devices, which makes it tough to recommend to casual gamers.
Though it’s fine to have at home, I wouldn’t take one with me on a trip or to a cafe, which defeats its purpose as a mobile device. Chief among its flaws, its battery life is subpar. In my sessions, the Steam Deck lasted roughly 90 minutes before needing to be plugged in, even when I was playing games with minimal graphics, like Vampire Survivors.
For another, it’s large (about 12 inches long) and heavy (1.5 pounds) for a portable gaming device. That makes Nintendo’s smaller and lighter Switch, which lasts upward of four hours on a charge, a superior portable.

While tinkering is purely optional, it is one of the Steam Deck’s main selling points — and compared with using a gaming computer, customizing the Steam Deck is not fun or easy with its keyboard, mouse and desktop software.
Lastly, while some may not mind the Steam Deck’s digital-only approach to buying games, many who prefer owning physical cartridges and discs — which can be easily shared with friends and resold to others — will view it as a dealbreaker.
Even so, the pandemic, which drove a surge in new gamers, proved that there were many different types of players, including those who dip into the occasional AAA title, and those who become addicted to a trendy game on their phones.

2022-07-08,"SEOUL — In South Korea, one of the world’s most technologically advanced countries, there are few limits to what can be done conveniently online — except if you’re using the wrong web browser.
On Google Chrome, you can’t make business payments online as a corporate customer of one of the country’s largest foreign-owned banks. If you’re using Apple’s Safari, you’re unable to apply for artist funding through the National Culture and Arts website. And if you’re a proprietor of a child care facility, registering your organization with the Health and Welfare Ministry’s website is not possible on Mozilla’s Firefox.
In all these cases, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, or a similar alternative, is the required browser.
When Microsoft shut down Internet Explorer, or IE, on June 15, the company said it would start redirecting users to its newer Edge browser in the coming months. The announcement inspired jokes and memes commemorating the internet of yesteryear. But in South Korea, IE is not some online artifact. The defunct browser is still needed for a small number of critical banking and government-related tasks that many people can’t live without.

South Korea’s fealty to Internet Explorer, 27 years after its introduction and now into its retirement, presents a heavy dose of irony: A country known for blazing broadband and innovative devices is tethered to a buggy and insecure piece of software abandoned by most of the world long ago.
Most South Korean websites work on every browser, including Google Chrome, which takes up about 54 percent of the country’s internet use. Internet Explorer is less than 1 percent, according to Statcounter. Yet after the announcement from Microsoft, there was a last-minute scramble among some essential sites to prepare for life after IE.
The South Korean arm of the British bank Standard Chartered warned corporate customers in May that they would need to start using the Edge browser in “IE mode” for access to its “Straight2Bank” internet banking platform. Various Korean government websites told users that some services were likely to face disruptions if they did not switch to Edge.
In May, Naver, one of Korea’s biggest internet companies, highlighted a feature of its Whale browser that allows access to sites that required Internet Explorer. Kim Hyo, who heads Naver’s Whale team, said the company had originally added the option in 2016. He thought it would no longer be needed when Microsoft shut down IE.

But as the final days approached, Mr. Kim realized that some Korean websites would not make the switch in time, so he kept the feature and changed its name to “Internet Explorer mode.” Modernizing websites that had catered to IE for decades was “quite a large task,” he said, and some sites “just missed the deadline.”

South Korea’s reliance on Internet Explorer dates back to the 1990s, when the country became a forerunner in using the internet for banking and shopping. In order to protect online transactions, the government passed a law in 1999 requiring encrypted digital certificates for any matter that had previously called for a signature.

Verifying a person’s identity required additional software that connected to the browser, known as a plug-in. The South Korean government authorized five companies to issue such digital certificates using a Microsoft plug-in called ActiveX. But the plug-in worked only on Internet Explorer.
At the time, using a Microsoft plug-in seemed like an obvious choice. Microsoft Windows software ruled the personal computer market in the 1990s, and Internet Explorer had leveraged that position to become the dominant browser. Because key Korean websites required IE, other websites began catering to Microsoft’s browser, reinforcing its importance. By one estimate, Internet Explorer had 99 percent market share in South Korea between 2004 and 2009.

“We were really the only game in town,” said James Kim, who led Microsoft in South Korea from 2009 to 2015. Mr. Kim, who now heads the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, said that Microsoft hadn’t tried to thwart the competition, but that a lot of things “didn’t work” without IE.

Kim Keechang, a law professor at Korea University in Seoul, said Internet Explorer’s stranglehold on South Korea was so complete in the early 2000s that most South Koreans “couldn’t name another browser.”
When Professor Kim returned to South Korea in 2002 after teaching abroad, he discovered that he couldn’t do anything online with his computer running Linux, a free, open-source alternative to Windows, and Firefox. Every year, he went to an internet cafe for access to a computer with IE in order to file his taxes on a government site.

In 2007, Professor Kim filed a lawsuit against the Korea Financial Telecommunications & Clearings Institute, one of the five government-approved private companies assigned to issue digital certificates. He argued that the company, which issued about 80 percent of South Korea’s certificates, had unjustly discriminated against him by not allowing other browsers.
Over three years, Professor Kim lost the case, lost the appeal and lost at the country’s Supreme Court. But his court battle drew broader attention to the pitfalls of South Korea’s system, especially after a 2009 cyberattack exploited ActiveX to spread malware on Korean computers.

With the advent of smartphones, an industry built on software from Apple and Google, South Korea, like much of the world, started to reduce its reliance on Microsoft. In 2010, the country issued guidelines that government websites should be compatible with three different web browsers. But changing the plumbing of South Korea’s internet was not easy — especially as banks and credit card companies stood by the existing system.
As public opinion shifted, users bristled at the inconvenience of needing to use ActiveX to buy things online. Critics argued that the technology had failed to meet its purpose because the plug-in software made users less safe.
Microsoft introduced Edge in 2015 as a replacement for Internet Explorer, and the company said it was not supporting ActiveX in the new browser. Chrome became the country’s top browser three years earlier.
In 2020, South Korea amended the 1999 law to eliminate the need for digital certificates, a move that seemed to close the book on ActiveX and Internet Explorer. That same year, Microsoft started removing support for IE in some of its online services. A year later, the company announced that it planned to retire Internet Explorer altogether.
While much of the world joked about Internet Explorer’s demise, one South Korean engineer marked the occasion in a more somber way.

Jung Ki-young, a 39-year-old software developer, erected a tombstone for IE on the rooftop of his older brother’s cafe in Gyeongju, a city on South Korea’s southeastern coast around 170 miles from Seoul. He paid $330 for the monument, which was engraved with the browser’s recognizable “e” logo and an inscription: “He was a good tool to download other browsers.”
Mr. Jung said he had his share of frustrations with Internet Explorer, but he felt the browser that had introduced so many South Koreans to the web deserved a proper goodbye.
“Using Internet Explorer was difficult and frustrating, but it also served a good purpose,” Mr. Jung said. “I don’t feel good about just retiring it with a ‘we don’t need you anymore’ attitude.”"
2022-07-09,"Driving rain pelted the windows of “the Tower,” a second-story glass enclosure in Ray Gaesser’s home that provides a view for miles of the gentle, rolling fields around Corning, Iowa. Inside, away from the elements, Mr. Gaesser pondered what the coming year might bring for farmers.
As tractors and planters throughout the Midwest rolled into fields like the ones near his house earlier this year, Mr. Gaesser, 69, was hopeful that soaring grain prices and heightened global demand for food would translate into robust revenues. But he also expected that sharply higher costs for fuel, fertilizer and other necessities would cut deeply into profits.
And then there is Big Food.
Companies like PepsiCo, Cargill, Walmart, and General Mills are trying to convince farmers like Mr. Gaesser to adopt new climate-friendly agricultural techniques through a variety of financial incentives and programs. They have good reason. Together, these companies have pledged that at least 70 million acres, or roughly 18 percent of the nation’s total cropland, an area about the size of Nevada, will be operated using regenerative agriculture techniques by 2030.
Through photosynthesis, plants — whether corn or trees — convert carbon dioxide from the air into energy that is stored in the soil. Regenerative farming techniques, such as planting a cover crop during the fall, allows that process to continue throughout the winter months when the soil would normally be bare.

But there are several complicating factors. The programs sponsored by the companies, which run from cost-sharing agreements with farmers to guarantees to cover any declines in yields to complex, multiyear contracts to pay for carbon dioxide that is captured and held in the soil, are largely still in pilot stages and amount to only a fraction of the companies’ overall goals. And many farmers remain skeptical of the initiatives, arguing that the incentives being offered simply aren’t enough to cover the additional costs these new techniques will incur.
“What is it worth to them for us to farm differently?” Mr. Gaesser asked.

Mr. Gaesser embodies many of the competing forces in the farming industry. A Republican who advised former President Donald J. Trump on agricultural issues, Mr. Gaesser is also a vocal proponent of climate-friendly farming methods and uses several across the 5,400 acres he farms with his son. But he does not believe that farmers should foot the bill for overhauling decades-long practices.
“There has to be value, or opportunity, throughout the whole food chain,” he said. “Are customers willing to pay more for food that is farmed in a climate-friendly manner?”
The global food system, which accounts for a third of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, is under pressure from consumers and investors to create tangible plans to reduce that output. At the same time, they are undertaking other initiatives, like eliminating plastic in packaging and reducing water usage, to make their products more sustainable.

But attempts to achieve those climate goals come at a tenuous time for the global food system. The pandemic, supply chain breakdowns and the war in Ukraine, one of six major breadbaskets of the world, has food companies scrambling — and paying higher prices — for the grains necessary for the bulk of the food they produce.
The current agricultural system is not “flexible enough to rapidly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions,” said Hannah Birgé, a senior scientist of food and water for the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit that has teamed up with corporations to meet sustainability goals. “It’s not working for the farmer, not working for the supply chain and not working for the consumer.”
But who should ultimately bear the costs for food grown in a more sustainable manner — farmers, corporations, consumers or the government through federal programs — is not the only question swirling around regenerative agriculture.
Interviews with academics, nonprofit organizations, corporations and farmers indicate there is no standard definition of what constitutes regenerative agriculture. And practices that work on one piece of land may not work on another.

But perhaps the biggest barrier is farmers themselves, with their age, experience, culture and politics presenting challenges. For decades, the average age of farmers in the United States has been creeping higher; in 2017, was nearly 58 years old. Experts say that convincing farmers to give up yearslong techniques for newer approaches is a difficult task.

And while there has been more of an acceptance among farmers in the heartland that climate change is occurring, there are still plenty who view the discussion about solutions as talking points for Democrats. They chalk up events like increased droughts and the Great Flood of 2019 to long-term weather cycles.
“They know there are bigger rainfall events, maybe more than normal, but the political climate in Nebraska is not conducive to talking about climate change,” said Bob Bettger, 74, a fifth-generation farmer in Fairmont, Neb. “We’re a deep red state, and most farmers pretty much think that the climate changes naturally no matter what you do.”
Nonetheless, last year, Mr. Bettger, who has retired from active farming but wants to protect the wildlife near his fields, enrolled 240 of the 1,500 acres of land he owns into a regenerative agriculture program that will pay him for carbon dioxide that his land retains in the coming years.
“If you want to see change,” he said, “there has to be an economic incentive for farmers.”
‘A new risk’
After maneuvering through the pandemic, labor shortages and then various supply-chain scarcities for key ingredients, Big Food in recent months has had to contend with a new challenge: inflation.

Companies have already raised the prices of cereals, chips and cookies to cover the increased costs for the corn, soybeans and wheat that help make them.
Now, as they consider ways to achieve their sustainability goals, little is said about paying an even higher price for sustainably grown crops. Some pointed to a survey released earlier this year by the International Food Information Council, a nonprofit that is financed by the food and beverage industry, that found the majority of consumers were not willing to pay more for food that is grown using regenerative agriculture techniques. Instead, much of the focus centers on convincing farmers that the regenerative agriculture practices will pay for themselves over time.
Last year, the food and beverage giant PepsiCo set an ambitious goal. By 2030, seven million acres — its entire global farming footprint — would use regenerative agriculture techniques. To accomplish that, PepsiCo, which had $7.6 billion in profits last year, made an offer to share in the costs of some pilot programs.  If the farmers adopted climate-friendly techniques on a few acres of their farmland, PepsiCo would pay them $10 to $40 per acre for a year. In the first year, PepsiCo enrolled 345,000 acres in various programs and believes there could be an “exponential curve” in growth in the coming years.
“We believe there is a period of time where farmers need a bridge to get through the process,” said Jim Andrew, PepsiCo’s chief sustainability officer. “What we have found is they try it and then, in the second year, they dramatically expand the square footage using the techniques because they see the benefits.”
Last year, a nonprofit called the Soil Health Institute conducted and Cargill funded a study that looked at 100 farms that used regenerative agricultural techniques. It found that 67 percent of them reported higher yields, producing more corn or soybeans. In addition, costs dropped and incomes surged.

But others say changing the composition of the soil can take years, requires consistent effort, and that it was still an open question whether this type of farming is financially beneficial for farmers.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
“From what I see, most corporations are willing to pay, but they don’t have a clear vision yet for how much this will cost or for how long,” said Debbie Reed, executive director of Ecosystem Services Market Consortium, who works with corporations and farmers to develop climate programs. “Farmers have to have skin in the game and understand that if they do not make these changes, they will be out of business.”
Though “regenerative agriculture” may be a popular buzz phrase in climate circles, the practices behind it are anything but new. For decades, a small contingent of farmers have taken steps, like reducing or not tilling a field after harvest, to prevent soil erosion; planting cover crops during the fall; rotating different crops each year to avoid depleting the soil of key nutrients; and controlled grazing of fields by cattle and other livestock.
Because technological leaps resulted in improved seeds, synthetic fertilizers and other products that increased crop yields in order to meet higher demand, wider adoption of these farming methods haven’t caught on.

Moreover, farmers have been discouraged from diversifying what they plant or taking risks with new sustainable farming practices because of existing government programs, like the federal crop insurance program, a safety net developed during the 1930s that pays farmers for poor or lost harvests. Under the program, farmers buy insurance for commodity crops like corn and soybeans based on past years’ yields.

Asking farmers to reverse decades of practice and take on, in some cases, new expense and potential risks with regenerative farming has been a tough sell.
The soil on roughly 21 percent of farmland wasn’t tilled continuously over a four-year period while only 12 percent was planted with cover crops, according to a 2017 survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Most experts expect to see those percentages climb when the latest U.S.D.A. survey, which is done every five years, is conducted this year.
Part of the reason that adoption for cover crops has been slower is cost. Academics from Ohio State University and the University of Illinois estimated earlier this year that it cost $37 an acre in seed, equipment cost and labor to plant a cover crop each year. For a 300-acre farm in Iowa, that’s an additional $11,000 in costs each year, and experts say inflation has likely driven prices even higher.

But time is also a factor. “We’re planting a cover crop at the same time we’re trying to harvest a primary crop that is our paycheck for the next 12 months,” said Nathan Anderson, a board member of the Practical Farmers of Iowa, a nonprofit organization that works with farmers and corporations to move to more climate-friendly operations. “That’s a new risk.”

Still, as he steered his pickup around the deep ruts filled with water from recent  rains on the gravel roads around Aurelia, in northwest Iowa, Mr. Anderson, 34, said the new sustainable techniques he started to use on land he farms with his family have shown results.
When the Iowa winds blow, the topsoil on their fields stays put. When the spring rains come down, his soil infiltrates the water better. He attributes these changes to not tilling the soil and planting a variety of cover crops during the winter.
But when asked whether he has seen an improvement in yields or farm profitability, Mr. Anderson shrugged.

It is likely, he says, his overall costs have gone down, noting that he certainly uses less fertilizer and herbicides, but he does incur additional costs with planting cover crops. Yet the only change he sees in yields occurs during extreme weather conditions, like drought.
“In fields that got less rain last year, the yields were less than other areas, but more than what we saw before we started using some of these techniques,” Mr. Anderson said. “When your crop can make it to the next rain without wilting, that’s a beneficial thing for yields.”

These days, the latest gold rush is found in the Midwest. There, amid the dark, crumbly soil, food companies and others say lies a new product — and revenue stream — for farmers: carbon.
Last year, Cargill began offering farmers $20 for every metric ton of carbon dioxide they were able to sequester, or coax from the atmosphere and into the soil, in their fields through regenerative farming techniques.

Cargill, which is privately held, set a target two years ago that 10 million acres of land in North America would be farmed sustainably by 2030. Cargill said it has 360,000 acres so far involved in a variety of regenerative agriculture programs, but did not break out how much of those involved carbon sequestration. “We see a tremendous amount of interest from the farmer and ranching community,” said Heather Tansey, the head of Cargill’s environmental sustainability group.
Cargill is one of many corporations and companies crisscrossing the Midwest, offering contracts to farmers for the carbon dioxide they sequester in their soil. For Cargill, that carbon can be counted as part of its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.
Other groups are selling the carbon credits. Last year, Microsoft, which has a goal to be carbon negative by 2030, paid $2 million, or $20 per metric ton, for carbon that was sequestered in land farmed by members of the Land O’Lakes agricultural cooperative and some independent farmers to offset its own greenhouse gas emissions.
But many farmers say the prices they’re being offered are too low.

“We looked at the Cargill program and we do think that, eventually, selling carbon offsets will be a good way for farmers to cover or even make money from regenerative farming,” said Julie Miller, who with her husband, Brent, and her daughter Allie farm 3,000 acres near Onawa, Iowa, some of which has been in the family for six generations. “But it’s so early in its development that the concern is you sign a contract to sell carbon for a few dollars when, down the road, it could be worth much more.”

This year, Cargill is offering farmers $25 per metric ton.
But experts say it can take years for carbon to accumulate in the soil, and that it can be time-consuming and costly to measure and verify the changes in soil in fields.
“Soil carbon sequestration is a work in progress,” said Ms. Reed of Ecosystem Services Market Consortium, which has worked with General Mills, Archer Daniels Midland and others on various pilot projects. “Many programs have gone straight to new technologies, and not all of them know what they are doing, and/or are cutting corners.”

2022-07-11,"As a group of conservative states enacted severe abortion restrictions last year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois sent letters to a handful of corporate executives with close ties to Texas.
Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, urged executives to rethink basing their companies in “a state that strips its residents of their dignity.” Most workers, he wrote, did not want to live under a rigid abortion ban.
There was no immediate response to his overture. Companies thriving in Texas’ freewheeling business environment were not about to flee because of legally contested abortion regulations that were not certain to be enforced.
Ten months later, the political and legal landscape is radically different. And a Supreme Court decision that abolished the right to an abortion is now threatening to reshape the lines of economic competition between conservative and liberal states.

For companies anchored in economically vibrant conservative states like Texas, Tennessee and Georgia, the rollback of women’s rights is no longer a hypothetical scenario but an immediate challenge. It represents a potential disruption to the calculus that has made Republican-led Sun Belt states a draw for big companies, which have tended to embrace the reduced taxes and regulations while treating local social policy as something of a sideshow.
That bargain may have grown more difficult in states that have imposed punitive abortion restrictions, banning the procedure altogether or limiting it nearly to the point of elimination.
Some of the country’s biggest businesses, including JPMorgan Chase, AT&T and the Walt Disney Company, have already announced they would take steps to help employees who need abortion access but cannot obtain it in their home states. There have not yet been major announcements about companies canceling expansions or relocating offices out of jurisdictions where abortion is now banned.

In states like Texas and Georgia, Republican lawmakers are effectively wagering that the local business environment will remain appealing enough to overcome concerns about women’s rights. And to some conservative politicians, the risk of alienating business investment is a price worth paying to eradicate abortion.

The fallout of the Supreme Court’s ruling could be more dangerous for states that share Texas’ economic and social policies but lack its longstanding status as an economic powerhouse — states like Arkansas and Oklahoma, which have passed some of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country.
In places where pitched battles over abortion laws are now underway, some business leaders are urging politicians to proceed with caution.
“An extreme response is not in the state’s competitive interest,” said Sandy Baruah, president of the Detroit Regional Chamber, an influential business association in Michigan. “To the extent that the data shows today that young professionals care about this issue, I don’t want to give young professionals a reason not to come to Michigan to work for Michigan companies.”
Mr. Baruah’s group responded to the Supreme Court’s decision with a statement imploring state officials not to do anything that could make Michigan less hospitable for business recruitment. The state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Republican-controlled Legislature are currently clashing over the fate of a nearly century-old abortion ban that had been voided by Roe v. Wade but never formally repealed.
Mr. Baruah acknowledged that some states, like Texas, might be so well established as business havens that they could shrug off concerns about abortion rights and talent recruitment. Of his own state, Mr. Baruah said: “Michigan needs every advantage it can get.”

In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, gave a similar warning on Wednesday as he issued an executive order reinforcing abortion rights in the state. Mr. Cooper, who has vowed to veto any abortion ban approved by the Republican legislature, said any such measure “would have a negative effect on economic growth here in our state.”
Some Republican-controlled states that have already imposed limits on abortions, like Florida and South Carolina, are weighing whether to tighten them even further. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, perhaps the most prominent conservative governor, has enacted a 15-week ban, but some state legislators are pushing for a so-called heartbeat bill that would block all but the earliest abortions.
Gina Raimondo, the nation’s commerce secretary, said in an interview that the states imposing rigid abortion bans were all but certain to suffer economically.

“I’ve spoken to C.E.O.s who are rethinking those states,” said Ms. Raimondo, a Democrat. “I think the cumulative effect will, over time, develop to be quite significant.”

Big companies are fighting a “war for talent,” Ms. Raimondo said, and particularly for female talent given that women make up a growing majority of new college graduates. A former governor of Rhode Island, Ms. Raimondo predicted that companies would find it difficult to recruit skilled workers in states where women’s rights and medical services were sharply curtailed.
There is data to back up that view: A survey published this month by the Pew Research Center found that more than 3 in 5 people with college and postgraduate degrees disapproved of the Supreme Court’s decision, along with nearly 70 percent of people under 30. Sixty-two percent of women disapproved of the decision, according to the survey.
A young and educated cohort of workers has been pushing companies in recent years to be more vocal in speaking out on issues of broad social concern, including gay rights and racial justice, bringing some major corporations into conflict with the conservative-leaning states they call home.
Some liberal states are already depicting their abortion rights policies as a business advantage, reinforcing the appeal of the wealthier and more progressive states that many businesses opt to call home in spite of their taxes.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, suggested that companies should consider his state’s ironclad abortion rights protections as an inducement to expand there. Mr. Pritzker, a billionaire venture capitalist before entering politics, said in a recent interview that his administration was including information about Illinois’s permissive abortion laws in its recruitment pitch to companies, particularly since the court’s draft opinion leaked in a Politico article in early May.

As a political matter, Mr. Pritzker urged Democrats to lean into the message that abortion restrictions were bad for the economy.
“A Democratic president and vice president, Democrats more broadly, should be talking about this first as an issue of individual rights and freedom, and second as an economic issue,” he said. “Workers care about this.”

This is not the first time in recent years when right-wing social policies have thrown state-level business competition into turmoil. In 2016, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina triggered a multiyear business boycott by passing a law — known as the “bathroom bill” — requiring transgender people to use facilities that matched the gender they were assigned at birth. Two years earlier, the business community in Arizona mobilized in force against so-called religious freedom legislation that could have opened the door to discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. people.
In Virginia, a 2012 attempt by far-right legislators to mandate that women receive invasive ultrasounds before obtaining an abortion caused outrage among moderate voters and corporate leaders, helping vault a pro-business Democrat into the governorship the next year. In 2011, the Mississippi business community rallied to defeat a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have granted legal rights to a fertilized egg, defying the Roe v. Wade decision that was then in place.

Yet even amid that drumbeat of controversy, a handful of big, conservative-leaning states like Texas, Florida and Georgia have defied predictions that anti-gay policies or laissez-faire gun laws would deter new investment. Indeed, Republican governors have recently grown more willing to defy big business: When Disney recently expressed disapproval of a Florida law limiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, Mr. DeSantis responded with a blistering attack.
Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who served as a top official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, questioned whether the abortion laws would do much to undermine the economic appeal of conservative states.
“These red states with low taxes, low regulation, investments in education and roads — that’s the real contrast with these older blue states that are kind of falling apart,” Mr. Reed said.
There is no recent precedent, however, for a rightward lurch in state-level policy on the scale of the crackdown on abortion that is now underway across much of the United States. The full impact of new restrictions is still uncertain in many states, and some bans are riddled with questions about how they will be enforced. A few, like Oklahoma’s total ban on abortion, appear to be so sweeping that they could imperil other kinds of reproductive care, including certain fertility treatments.

In Texas, the biggest and most prosperous state where abortion is now illegal, business leaders are expressing guarded optimism that the state’s economy can weather any backlash. The equipment manufacturer Caterpillar announced in mid-June that it was relocating its headquarters from Illinois to Texas, even though the court’s draft opinion had been published at that point.

Glenn Hamer, president of the Texas Association of Business, said the state’s core appeal to big corporations was still intact.
“The fundamentals of the Texas economy and the Texas work force remain very strong and I would expect continued strong growth well into the future,” said Mr. Hamer, whose organization has not taken a position on the state’s abortion laws.
Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has professed no concern about abortion restrictions deterring business investment. In an email, Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for the governor, boasted of the state’s “unmatched competitive advantages,” including “no corporate or personal income taxes, a predictable regulatory climate and a young, growing and skilled work force.”
Rachel Smith, the president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said the patchwork of state abortion bans would strain big companies with employees in multiple jurisdictions and clashing local laws. Ms. Smith, whose organization represents companies including Amazon and Microsoft, said many recruits viewed medical care — including top-flight reproductive medicine — as a “foundational” concern in choosing their workplace.
“Was it taken for granted in a lot of places? Sure — I’m sure it was,” Ms. Smith said. “Is access to more comprehensive health care now at the top of the list for more people? I’m sure it is. The changes are causing people to be more deliberate.”"

2022-07-13,"Netflix has selected Microsoft to help build its forthcoming ad-supported tier, the streaming giant said on Wednesday.
In April, after announcing in its first-quarter earnings report that it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade, Netflix unexpectedly said it would introduce a less expensive offering with commercials to try to boost subscription numbers. At the time, Reed Hastings, a co-chief executive at Netflix, said the company would seek a third party to help build the new tier. Netflix has never had a dedicated sales and advertising team, and for years had vowed that commercials would never appear on its service.
Since the announcement, Netflix had talked to a number of companies about a potential partnership, including NBCUniversal, Google and the Trade Desk.
Netflix has also told staff that it hopes to introduce the advertising tier by the end of the year. The company will still have its commercial-free tier, which is more expensive for subscribers.
“Microsoft has the proven ability to support all our advertising needs as we work together to build a new ad-supported offering,” Greg Peters, Netflix’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. “More importantly, Microsoft offered the flexibility to innovate over time on both the technology and sales side, as well as strong privacy protections for our members.”
It has been an ugly few months for Netflix. The company has laid off hundreds of staff members, and its stock price has gone into a tailspin. On Tuesday, the company garnered fewer Emmy nominations than its rival HBO, despite having significantly more programming than the cable network and its streaming service, HBO Max. Netflix will announce its second-quarter earnings next week, and previously said it could lose another two million subscribers during the quarter.
Netflix executives hope that introducing a lower-priced advertising tier will attract cost-conscious subscribers. Some analysts have cautioned that by introducing a cheaper service, the streaming service could cannibalize from its base of subscribers who pay more for a commercial-free experience.
“At launch, consumers will have more options to access Netflix’s award-winning content,” said Mikhail Parakhin, the president of web experiences at Microsoft. “Marketers looking to Microsoft for their advertising needs will have access to the Netflix audience and premium connected TV inventory.”"

What Biden wants from the Saudis
President Biden, on his first visit to the Middle East since taking office, is embracing his predecessor’s approach to diplomacy in the region: deals as a path to peace. Biden has not been shy about his support for the Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries. But he did vow during his election campaign to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for its human rights violations, and he refused to speak with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Tomorrow, under pressure as tight oil supplies hurt the U.S. economy, he will meet M.B.S. on his territory.
“A more secure and integrated Middle East benefits Americans in many ways,” the president wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece on Saturday, explaining the visit. “Its waterways are essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on. Its energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact on global supplies of Russia’s war in Ukraine.”

The U.S. wants Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. On Saturday, Biden will meet with leaders of six oil-producing states in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia. Officials say oil won’t be the focus of talks with the group or the kingdom, though it is expected to come up, and they hope the Saudis will commit to increasing production soon after.
Even if that happens, there is limited spare capacity. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the only OPEC members that report significant unused output. President Emmanuel Macron of France told Biden at the Group of 7 summit last month that the U.A.E.’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, told him that both countries are at or close to “maximum” production.
But the oil crunch may already be easing. A report yesterday from the International Energy Agency suggests that the worst of the supply crisis may be over. The agency cut forecasts for demand for this year and next, pointing to high prices that would reduce consumption and slow the global economy. And gas prices in the U.S. have fallen, reducing some of the pressure on Biden. Still, Darren Woods, the Exxon Mobil C.E.O., last month predicted up to five more years of “tight” oil markets.
In Israel, Biden is emphasizing “integration.” Israeli officials have encouraged the president’s meeting with Saudi Arabia. It may already be yielding deals — an agreement to open Saudi airspace to commercial flights from Israel, a move that airlines have reportedly been lobbying for, is in the works and could be announced this week. But neither nation is the primary motivation for this tour. “We have to counter Russia’s aggression, put ourselves in the best possible position to outcompete China, and work for greater stability in a consequential region of the world,” Biden wrote. “To do these things, we have to engage directly with countries that can impact those outcomes. Saudi Arabia is one of them.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Investors increasingly expect the Fed to raise rates by a full percentage point this month. After the sharp rise in consumer prices in June, the Fed is likely to continue increasing interest rates quickly, even if doing so risks tipping the economy into a recession. Inflation is likely to fall in July because of lower gas prices.
The crypto lender Celsius files for bankruptcy. The move comes a month after it froze withdrawals, raising the prospect that more than a million account holders will not be able to get their money back. An outflow of money from crypto investments has shaken the foundations of crypto banks and start-ups.
Higher fares and recession worries are not curbing the pent-up demand for air travel. Delta’s C.E.O., Ed Bastian, said yesterday that while demand was strong, the airline would limit its capacity, seeking to avoid cancellations and delays. Delta reported a profit of $735 million in the second quarter and said it expected steady demand into the winter.
The Gates Foundation will increase its giving. The foundation says it plans to raise the rate of its grant making to $9 billion each year by 2026 from nearly $6 billion before the pandemic. To put that in context, the Open Society Foundations, funded by George Soros and itself one of the nation’s biggest philanthropies, reported total spending in 2020 of $1.4 billion.
A senior executive at Alphabet leaves for Goldman Sachs. Jared Cohen, a founder and C.E.O. of Google Ideas, now known as Jigsaw, will join a new organization within Goldman, reporting to its C.E.O., David Solomon.

Why Netflix went with Microsoft
Yesterday, Netflix picked Microsoft to help build its ad-supported streaming service, which it says it will unveil by the end of the year. It’s been an ugly few months for Netflix, reports The Times’s John Koblin. The company has laid off hundreds of employees, and its stock price has gone into a tailspin.

Netflix appears to be betting that a lower-priced streaming service, paid for mainly by ads, can revive growth. But the move comes with risks, namely whether it will lure new subscribers, or just poach existing ones from its current offering. DealBook asked our colleague and longtime media watcher Ed Lee for insight on why Netflix chose Microsoft.

Netflix is taking a chance with Microsoft. Choosing Microsoft as its advertising partner over Google (whose business was built on digital advertising) and Comcast (whose NBCUniversal has sold ads for over half a century) could be seen as a deliberate snub. But it is also a risk. Those two giants were seen as front-runners to run Netflix’s new ad-supported tier because of their experience.
But the choice could also be seen as strategic. Both companies have competing streaming services. NBCUniversal owns Peacock, and Google owns the mother of all internet video, YouTube (as well as YouTube TV, a cable package delivered online). Netflix says it was looking for a partner to be able to grow its service with, not launch and then replace later on.
Microsoft is a big player in the world of online video and advertising. It sells ads on its Bing search engine and across its Xbox gaming platform. The choice also suggests that Netflix doesn’t yet have a ton of content available for its ad-supported service, because it will most likely take Microsoft longer to build out what is needed to start the service. The streamer has to renegotiate all of the licensed films and TV shows it carries to allow for ads. That process appears to be more fraught than Netflix first implied. That could delay its offering, but it could also have made it possible for Netflix to go with a relative newbie in the streaming space.

The pandemic limits work friendships
Early-career friendships can be life-defining. But since the coronavirus pandemic, they’ve become “something of an endangered species,” writes The Times’s Emma Goldberg. And that may continue with return-to-office timelines being repeatedly stretched. Goldberg spoke with dozens of people about the magic of their first work friends, and why those connections are so important to work itself. Here’s what Goldberg told DealBook she discovered.
The pandemic disrupted “soft work” — the relationship-building part of work. What is lost? Should employers care?
What was interesting to me was a lot of the older workers I spoke with, spoke to really tangible ways in which their work friends influenced their identities, their sense of self in the workplace and their career trajectories. One woman I interviewed said she really wanted to quit her job, and it was her best friend at work who intervened and helped her stick it out.
So I do think that companies and executives are going to have to wrestle with how to help people form these relationships that are going to shape their careers.

How do companies that stay hybrid or mostly remote support work friendships?
Companies are trying out so many different methods. Salesforce just opened up this site where people can come together for nature walks and meditation and all kinds of other fun in-person activities. Airbnb is saying that even though people never have to come back to the office, it is going to make a big effort to have people come together at least pretty regularly throughout the year. Zillow is renovating some of its office spaces to make them look more cozy — almost living-room areas where people can hang out together. So right now, we are in that kind of experimentation phase of seeing what actually works.
What do you think is the real point of an office?
Historically the office has been the assumption in terms of, that’s where work gets done, that’s where people go every day. And the gossip and the hanging out and the friendships were a byproduct of that — an accident, but one that turned out to be really important for the work and for productivity and for people feeling connected and engaged.
When the office got displaced, that happy accident of relationships and friendships went with it. And now people are wrestling with, if you’re not going to be able to fully reinstate what the old normal looks like, how do you at least capture some of the good that came out of the relationships and how that contributed to the quality of the work?

2022-07-15,"Investors had an awful start to the year as stocks twice entered bear market territory, falling more than 20 percent. Stocks didn’t hang there long the first time, but the second drop has proved more durable, as Wall Street has come to accept that inflation is more persistent and that the Federal Reserve will have to be more aggressive in combating it.
The S&P 500 lost 16.4 percent in the second quarter, leaving it 20.6 percent below its level at the end of 2021.
Where to now? While a bounce in stocks certainly seems due, investment advisers say a lasting recovery is unlikely for now. They warn that a recession is probably on the way, if it’s not here already, and that valuations remain high, even after the big decline.
“I think we’re in for a lot more pain, probably, in U.S. stocks,” said Meb Faber, chief investment officer of Cambria Investment Management. “Just to get back to historical valuations, we could easily go down a third from here.”

Ella Hoxha, a manager of global bond portfolios for Pictet Asset Management, said expectations still haven’t been adjusted to incorporate the likely risk of a recession. It may seem surprising that a recession could catch Wall Street by surprise when the conversation there is about little else. But until recently, Wall Street played down its chances and talked up the prospects of a soft landing, in which growth slows but the economy avoids major, prolonged disruption.
“The odds of a recession have gone up, but the markets have not fully priced in the recession case yet,” Ms. Hoxha said. “Not only is the Fed having to correct being too dovish last year, it has to unwind its balance sheet” by selling the bonds and other securities it bought to support the economy and markets.

Market forecasts are increasingly guided by assessments of how severe a recession will be, not whether one will occur. But the erosion in the economic outlook may still have further to go.
“The real question is not whether we have a recession, it’s how hard growth decelerates and how long the slowdown is sustained,” said Ron Temple, managing director of Lazard Asset Management. Most people, he said, still expect “a short, shallow recession.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A recession hits stock prices mainly by depressing corporate earnings. Just as investors may not be sufficiently factoring in a recession, Mr. Temple said that earnings expectations might need to come down further before stocks hit bottom.
“One missing piece of this story is that earnings expectations are probably not in the right place,” he said. “We’re probably going to see more downgrades.”
The most likely outcome, in his view, is a further 10 percent decline in stocks, and his “bear case,” which might come into play with another bad inflation report, is for stocks to fall as much as 25 percent more as the yield on the 10-year Treasury rises to 4 percent from just under 3 percent on June 30.
Owners of domestic stock funds know all about bear cases. The average portfolio fell 15.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Morningstar, with funds focusing on technology and consumer cyclical companies each losing more than 20 percent. Still, funds that own utility and health care stocks managed to keep losses to single digits.
Behind the Journalism

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Inflation and a sluggish economy are not just American phenomena. Europe has the same issues, along with some particular complications that make dealing with them problematic.

The average international stock fund fell 13.3 percent in the quarter, with Europe and Latin America portfolios doing slightly worse than average. China funds managed to eke out a 3.7 percent gain.
When a recession looms, the almost inevitable losses in stocks are usually cushioned by gains in long-term Treasury bonds as the worsening economic conditions push yields lower. A Citi Research report said a 20 percent decline in stocks on average coincides with a 12 percent gain in 10-year Treasury prices.
Not this time. Perhaps because the Fed distorted the bond market for so long with artificially low interest rates and quantitative easing, when stocks began to fall this year, so did bonds. In the first half, the 20+ Year Treasury Bond iShares exchange-traded fund fell 22.5 percent. S&P 500 SPDR, an E.T.F. that tracks that stock index, fell 20.6 percent.
The average bond fund was down 5.7 percent in the second quarter, Morningstar said, as long-term government portfolios fell 13.1 percent. High-yield and emerging-market funds suffered higher-than-average losses, too.
Deciding where to put your money isn’t easy in the best of conditions, and the current conditions are far from that. Beyond the inflationary backdrop and recession worries, uncertainty is certain to linger for several months until the impact of the Fed’s tightening becomes clear, as pandemic-era measures are unwound and as disruptions to trade created by the war in Ukraine work their way through the economy.

Ms. Hoxha recommends long-term Treasury bonds after the drubbing they have taken, but her call is less an expression of support for them than of disdain for everything else. She would avoid shorter-term maturities — up to two years — and corporate and European debt.
“When you can get a 3.5 yield and have an unclear picture about equities, you start to get paid a premium to own Treasuries and possibly do better than you can get in cash,” she said. “But don’t go all in. Some cash with some Treasuries might be a good mix.”
Mr. Faber finds American stocks expensive, but “foreign developed market valuations are totally reasonable, emerging markets are downright cheap and the value cohort for both of those is cheaper than the broad market.”
He prefers high-quality value stocks, meaning companies that trade at low multiples of earnings even though they generate enough cash to return money regularly to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
Mr. Faber thinks investors benefit twice when they buy value stocks.
“Value is good because it’s cheap and because you’re avoiding something that’s stupid expensive,” he said. “Avoiding the really expensive stuff in the last year has really saved everyone’s bacon.”

Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, a fund management company, prefers American stocks. In a presentation of the company’s investment outlook, she emphasized quality, as Mr. Faber did, highlighting characteristics like resilient balance sheets and an ability to increase dividends. But she favors growth stocks — stocks of companies whose earnings are less sensitive to economic ups and downs.
Among bonds, she and her colleagues favor municipal and high-yield issues and would limit exposure to long-term Treasuries.
Mr. Temple said he considered it counterproductive to try to choose between value and growth stocks. His advice is to go with either as long as you stick with quality, which he defines as “companies with high returns on capital that can be sustained.” Stocks in those companies usually do better when the economy weakens as investors seek safety. This year, though, quality has underperformed.
Companies that he likes and that have been marked down include Microsoft, Amazon and Google’s parent, Alphabet. All three stand to benefit from a continued move of business computing to the cloud. Mr. Temple also recommends the payment card networks Visa and American Express.
He acknowledged that these companies’ stocks, like the market broadly, may have further to fall. But he said he expected them to be solid buys over the long haul, even if holding them for the next few months may get uncomfortable.
“I’m not smart enough to pick the absolute low,” Mr. Temple said. “There are really good, quality companies that are on sale that you want to own for the next three to five years. We’re seeing more opportunities as this sell-off continues.”"

What’s Up? (July 10-16)
Twitter Plays Offense
In Elon Musk’s saga with Twitter, the end of one chapter is just the start of another. Shortly after signaling that he was backing out of his deal to buy the social media company, Mr. Musk was sued by Twitter. The company accused him of “knowingly, intentionally, willfully and materially” breaching their agreement. Mr. Musk’s lawyers said on Friday that Twitter’s request in the suit for an expedited trial in September was unreasonable and asked to delay it. When, and if, the case goes to trial, a judge in Delaware’s Court of Chancery will decide whether Mr. Musk’s claims that Twitter withheld information about spam accounts on the site are valid. The two parties could also settle, with Mr. Musk paying damages. Or, if his financing falls through, he could get out of the deal by paying a $1 billion breakup fee. Another possibility still is that Mr. Musk’s threat to walk away spooks Twitter into renegotiating with him, which could result in his buying the company at a discount. Worried shareholders will hear about how much damage Mr. Musk may have done when Twitter releases its second-quarter earnings this week.
Inflation Quickens
Already fast-rising prices picked up again last month, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report. The fresh inflation data showed prices surging 9.1 percent in June from a year ago. Record gas prices were the main driver of the high inflation figure. They have since dropped sharply — a factor that could lead to signs of moderation in July’s report. President Biden focused on this possibility in his response to the new numbers, calling them “out of date.” But even so-called core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, was higher than expected, at 5.9 percent. And overall there was little to be upbeat about in last week’s report, with experts saying it presented a significant challenge for the Federal Reserve as well as U.S. consumers.
The Euro’s Tumble
For the first time in 20 years, €1 equaled $1, after the euro reached parity with the dollar last week. The currency has been slipping since the beginning of the year because of disruptions to trade, sanctions on Russian energy after the country’s invasion of Ukraine and soaring prices for food and commodities in the eurozone. And as the euro waned, the dollar grew stronger, buoyed by investors who have turned to the American currency as a safe haven amid global economic upheaval. It appears that this dynamic will persist, even as the United States deals with its own economic strains.

What’s Next? (July 17-23)
Rising Interest Rates on the Agenda
With the euro’s fall making the continent’s economic situation appear that much more dire, the European Central Bank is expected to announce an interest-rate increase on Thursday. The move would be the first time that the E.C.B. has raised rates in more than a decade and set it on a more aggressive path similar to that of many other central banks around the world. Last week, the Bank of Canada raised its rates by a big 1 percentage point. The Federal Reserve is also heading for a steep rate increase as inflation continues to run at a troubling pace. Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said he was in favor of another three-quarter-point change this month, but an even larger increase, perhaps of 1 point, is possible.

A Critical Quarter for Netflix
Netflix has already prepared shareholders for its second-quarter financial statement this week. But that doesn’t mean the news will be any easier to swallow. In April, after announcing that it had lost 200,000 subscribers, Netflix warned that it was likely to lose two million more in the next three months as it struggled to stay competitive among a bevy of streaming options. Since then, the company has done multiple rounds of layoffs while its share price has plunged. As the streaming giant tries to recover, it is planning to create a cheaper, ad-supported subscription tier, with Microsoft as its partner. But the move is no guarantee of calmer waters for the company.
The Odds of a Recession
The likelihood of an imminent recession depends on whom you ask. Talk to the chief economist at Wells Fargo, and he’ll tell you a recession in 2023 “seems more likely than not.” Ask S&P Global Ratings, and it will say the chance of a deep downturn is basically a tossup. Last week, despite what some would consider clear warning signs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley said there was no recession in view yet. Despite the range of outlooks, the fact is that most people — analysts, economists and laypeople alike — are thinking about it and looking for clues in indicators like yield curves, inflation data, quarterly earnings and investor attitudes. And as the Fed tries to pump the brakes on the economy, anxiety that it could tip the country into a serious slowdown will continue to mount.
What Else?
Bank of America was fined $225 million by federal regulators for mishandling pandemic unemployment benefits. Amid travel chaos, Delta Air Lines flew an empty plane to Heathrow Airport in London to pick up stranded luggage and bring it back to the United States. And Heathrow said it would limit the number of passengers until the end of the summer as it faces staffing shortages."

2022-07-19,"Late last month, more than 10.4 million subscribers to a YouTube channel received a notification that usually brought good news: Technoblade, an expert Minecraft player, had posted a new video.
For fans, each new video held the promise of Technoblade’s warm humor, whether he was winning a tournament or going on an inexplicable quest to produce more potatoes than anyone else in a Minecraft minigame.
But when fans clicked play on this latest video, called “so long nerds,” it was immediately obvious something was wrong. Instead of showing Minecraft gameplay, a man identifying himself as Technoblade’s father appeared. He announced that his son, whose first name was Alex, had died after being diagnosed with cancer.

Technoblade’s father read a message from his son in a video announcement of his death that has been viewed more than 25 million times.
The video has been viewed more than 72.9 million times since it was published on June 30 as the fans who used to look forward to Technoblade’s notifications try to process the death of someone they have known only through a screen.

Social media is flooded with fan art, tributes and links to grief resources. Memorials have been erected within Minecraft, including a digital book that had been signed by more than 377,000 people.
The grief has ricocheted offline, including into the home of Noelle, 13, and her sister Ilana, 11, who had recently told their aunt to name her baby Technoblade.
In a video call from their home near Toronto, Noelle said she learned that Alex had died on her last day of school.
“I was just a mess,” she said. “I was just sitting in my room crying. I didn’t know what to do.”
Ilana, who dressed up as Technoblade’s avatar, a pig in a crown, for Halloween, said, “I don’t like to bring up the topic when I am just sitting with others.”

They both started watching Alex’s videos in late 2020. They liked his lighthearted banter with other Minecraft players and how he would monologue about the absurdity of routine parts of life, like using, and losing, a box to carry soap to a communal shower in college.
Alex spoke over screen recordings of himself playing Minecraft, the immensely popular video game developed by Mojang Studios in which players can create their own world piece by piece and compete against others online. The game developer was later bought by Microsoft.
The guided gameplay had garnered such a following that the company made a tribute to Technoblade on its launch page after he died. Mojang Studios said Technoblade “became synonymous with a source of good” in an emailed statement.
Among Technoblade’s most beloved game adventures was his whimsical quest to make more potatoes than anyone else in Minecraft, a feat first documented in The Great Potato War video, which had 35.8 million views.
In the video, Alex makes several references to Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War,” as he tries to topple the top potato producer at the time, a player who uses the moniker im_a_squid_kid. After Technoblade sees that his competition has created a rendering of the Mona Lisa in his Minecraft lair, he declares that im_a_squid_kid is not just “a potato madman, but a potato supervillain.”

Shielding an offline identity
In Alex’s videos, he talked about going to college (and dropping out to play Minecraft full time) and made occasional references to his family, but there was a clear boundary between Alex, the son and brother, and Technoblade. His family has sought to maintain that privacy since his death and declined to be interviewed.
Alex announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer in an August 2021 video threaded with jokes in which he also mentioned that he was 22 at the time. He did not specify what type of cancer he had, but his followers assumed that he had sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that is found in bone and soft tissues, because he created a fund-raiser for the Sarcoma Foundation of America on his YouTube page. He had raised more than $500,000 for the organization before the “so long nerds” video was published.
The foundation, which created a special donation page for Technoblade, said that an estimated 17,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with sarcoma in 2022, and more than 7,200 people will die from the disease.
After Alex died, his fans encouraged eligible people to donate blood to help cancer patients.
Riley, a 21-year-old in Connecticut, routinely donates blood in honor of a friend who died of sarcoma, and she made her most recent donation in Technoblade’s honor. She said his death was all the more difficult because of her earlier loss. “I was bawling like a baby for a couple hours,” she said. (Riley spoke on the condition that her last name not be used because she has faced online harassment.)

She has played Minecraft for about 10 years, but she did not discover Technoblade until the early days of the pandemic when she was working grueling shifts at a grocery store. “There was not a lot of joy in my life being an essential worker,” she said.
She liked Technoblade’s humor and introduced his videos to some of her co-workers, who were reminded of his famous potato war at work. “We were stocking potatoes one night and we just started laughing,” she said.
Technoblade inspired Riley to start broadcasting videos of herself playing video games, or streaming, under the name Notable_Crayon. It has been a great way to unwind, she said, but it has also shown her why someone as popular as Technoblade would protect his offline identity.

Occasionally people will figure out Riley’s full name and send her “creepy” messages, she said. She also has a friend who was the victim of swatting, false reports of crimes in progress intended to draw armed police to the victim’s home. Her friend was not hurt, but others have been harmed, with one man killed by the police and another dying of a heart attack.
In the “so long nerds” video, Alex’s father read a letter that he said his son wrote about eight hours before he died. In the letter, Alex acknowledged the consequences of sharing personal information online and revealed that he and a sibling had successfully convinced online fans that his first name was Dave by using the name in a 2016 video, which was later deleted.
Alex said the prank resulted in “thousands of creepy online dudes trying to get overly personal, going, ‘Oh hey, Dave, how’s it going?’”
Navigating the loss of an online friend
For some fans, the mystery of Alex’s identity has added a confusing layer to the muddle of grief.
Richard England, a vicar at Crofton Parish on the south coast of Britain, said that his teenagers were both devastated by Alex’s death and that they had a few conversations about how not knowing Technoblade’s offline identity affected their grieving.
“Through this new online, offline world we have, many of them will feel like they will know Technoblade and other members of those online communities better than they know kids in their own school,” Mr. England, 47, said. “They will have spent just as much time with them.”
In Canada, Noelle and Ilana’s mother, Janice, admitted she was skeptical at first about the idea that you could have fun watching videos of someone else playing video games. But she said the girls had educated her about the Minecraft world and its personalities, which she now appreciates.
Janice, 52, was well suited to handle her children’s grief about Technoblade because she said she previously worked with children in grief as a child life specialist, a role that helps children and families cope with stress they experience because of health problems, hospitalization and bereavement.

She said that adults tend to want to protect children from uncomfortable feelings, but that it was important to give them space to express, or not express, how they were feeling about Technoblade.
“If we help our children through grief when they experience it,” she said, “then they will be better able to cope with it when they are older and have other situations in their lives that would cause them to be grieving.”

In the video call with her daughters, Janice said her sister in Maryland had called after Technoblade died, because her son was also a big fan. The boy had decided to raise money for the sarcoma foundation, Janice said, prompting Ilana to turn toward her mother and ask: “Is there a way I can help him with that?”"

2022-07-22,"Streams of freshly minted quarterly earnings reports are beginning to arrive from corporate America, promising a fuller picture of how important segments of the economy fared as the stock market fell in the spring and early summer.
More important, executives are giving “guidance” to analysts on how their companies are likely to perform in the months ahead. This exercise in compulsory financial disclosure always commands attention on Wall Street.
But this is no ordinary time. Investors have been flummoxed by the unusual array of circumstances weighing down the economy. Earnings reports may have an outsize impact on short-term market movements this season, even if the information being offered is usually sanitized and meager in substance.
I’ve been answering readers’ questions in columns lately. Truly long-term investors — those who plan on sticking with the stock market for at least a decade and preferably longer, and who use diversified, low-cost index funds that track the whole stock market — can safely ignore these short-term fluctuations.
In that sense, this column is a digression. It’s an assessment of an important aspect of the stock market cycle, not a specific guide to investing. But you may feel more comfortable with the day-to-day shifts in the stock market if you are aware of what is going on.
Fundamentally, the data arriving now may depict a late phase — maybe even the last one — of a broad expansion in corporate profits that helped to fuel the stock market from March 2020 until the beginning of this year. Energy companies continue to thrive, but nearly every other sector is facing difficulties.
It could be worse
Companies like JPMorgan Chase, Netflix, Johnson & Johnson, Lockheed, Goldman Sachs, Tesla and Halliburton have already reported their revenues and earnings for the three months that ended on June 30, and a host of others will do so in the next several weeks.
Some of the early reports, especially in the oil and gas sector, have been fabulous. For example, Halliburton, the energy services company, beat Wall Street expectations when it posted earnings on Tuesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Jeff Miller, the company’s chief executive, told analysts on an earnings call that with demand for oil rising, he expected strong earnings in the years ahead and was not troubled by the possibility of a recession.
“What we see in our business is activity demand moving up,” he said. “We see a tighter 2023 than we see in 2022. So all of these signals and in our business are extremely positive.”
For many other companies, though, the quarterly reports have simply not been as bad as may have been expected.
Consider Netflix. It is the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year, and has been losing millions of subscribers. But its latest subscription losses weren’t as dire as analysts had anticipated. As Reed Hastings, the company’s chairman and co-founder, put it in an online presentation on Tuesday: “We’re talking about losing one million instead of losing two million, so our excitement is tempered by the less-bad results.”
The words of Mr. Hastings may encapsulate the best hopes of stock analysts for the entire stock market in the months ahead. Under current conditions, Wall Street will, for the most part, be satisfied if the outlook seems less bad than a reasonable person may have feared.

Puncturing some of the optimism
Wall Street stock analysis overall is far more positive than the state of the world seems to warrant.
With the Federal Reserve likely to raise interest rates further this coming week in an effort to bring down inflation, a recession may be in the offing, and a bear market is already underway. Coronavirus infections are surging; Russia’s war in Ukraine is grinding on; oil, gas and other commodity prices are still high; supply-chain issues linger; and a ferocious heat wave blankets much of the Northern Hemisphere.
Yet Wall Street stock analysts continue to forecast gains in corporate earnings and revenues as far as the eye can see. The consensus on Wall Street, based on IBES data from Refinitiv, is that corporate America will achieve higher earnings and revenues in every quarter through the first three months of 2024. That’s the most distant date on Wall Street radar.
Don’t take these rosy estimates too seriously.
“We’re clearly on the downside of the profits cycle, but you don’t see that in the Wall Street estimates, not yet,” said Richard Bernstein, a former chief investment strategist at the old Merrill Lynch who now runs his own firm, Richard Bernstein Advisors. “Eventually, you will.
“Wall Street analysts are neither at the beginning nor the end of anything,” he continued. “They’re always positioned in the middle. When you start getting ‘negative surprises’ in corporate earnings — when a lot of companies aren’t meeting expectations — analysts will say at first that it’s an aberration.” Then, he said, they will, en masse, revise their projections down sharply.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Bernstein expects to see more downward revisions fairly soon — and then, sometime in the future, when earnings begin to improve again, he says, Wall Street will be slow to recognize that. “Nobody will want to be the first to say that, either,” he said.
The big picture
The reports being issued over the next several weeks will be looking backward. They will describe corporate performance in the second quarter and reflect an economy that, by metrics like the unemployment rate, was still surprisingly strong.
The Wall Street consensus on July 8 was that most companies were managing to squeeze out substantial profits on robust revenues. The average estimate for S&P 500 companies, according to Refinitiv, called for:
Revenue to be 10.6 percent higher than in the second quarter of 2021.
Earnings to be 5.7 percent higher.
Look a little more closely, though, and you will see that energy companies were expected to provide most of those earnings. Elevated oil and gas prices have hurt consumers and most companies, but they are wonderful if you are the chief executive of Halliburton or of Exxon Mobil, which will report earnings next Friday.
Exclude results from energy companies and the picture immediately darkens. These are the average estimates then:
Revenue would rise 6.6 percent from the same quarter in 2021.
Earnings would decline 3 percent.
We won’t have a final tally for months, but so far, companies have been modestly exceeding these expectations, which is exactly what usually happens during earnings season.
Customarily, Wall Street analysts set earnings expectations low enough that the companies they follow exceed them. Corporate executives help to guide these estimates lower as earnings reports approach, making it easier to surpass them. Shares tend to rise in response to these “positive surprises.”

I wrote about this ritual dance between corporate executives and analysts nine summers ago, and while the personalities are different, the basic dynamic hasn’t changed much since then.
A crucial question now is whether this dance will take on a frantic aspect this year — and whether overall corporate earnings are about to drop sharply and the economy is on the verge of falling into a full-blown recession.
It’s too early to say, but a host of big companies will report earnings this coming week. In addition to Exxon, they include Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, GE, General Motors, Boeing and Apple — a range broad enough to encompass a representative swath of corporate America.
We may be at the beginning of the downward slope of the earnings cycle, but numbers alone won’t tell the story adequately. That’s why it’s worth poring over transcripts of executives’ conversations with analysts for clues about where things may be heading.
What to do about it
So what should investors do about it?
Whatever the economic portents show, try to be nimble. To cite the immortal words of Yogi Berra, “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.”
Fortify yourself against all possibilities, so that whatever direction earnings and the economy go, you will be protected. Certainly, that means putting aside enough money to pay the bills and to take care of emergencies.
After that, think long term. I’ll be returning with some guidance on how to invest for the long haul even if the economy sputters."

2022-07-26,"SEATTLE — The uncertainty and challenges in the global economy have hit Microsoft, which on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street’s and its own expectations.
The tech giant said it had $51.9 billion in sales in the quarter ended June 30, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Profit rose 2 percent to $16.7 billion.
The results missed even Microsoft’s own reduced expectations. In early June, the company lowered its guidance for the quarter to account for the increasingly strong U.S. dollar.
“We’re obviously incredibly bullish on just about everything else that we have,” Chris Capossela, the company’s marketing chief, said after the revised guidance was released. “That’s one thing we can’t control.”

Since then, the conditions appear to have deteriorated further. The foreign currency challenges spurred by the war in Ukraine and broader economic uncertainty cost Microsoft $595 million in the quarter as it converted sales in Europe, Japan and elsewhere back into U.S. dollars. And production slowdowns of personal computers in China and falling consumer demand caused a decline of more than $300 million in sales of its Windows operating system that comes preinstalled on new computers.
A slowdown in advertising spending on LinkedIn and on Microsoft’s search products caused more than a $100 million decline in revenue.
Were it not for currency problems, Microsoft’s flagship cloud computing platform, Azure, would have grown 46 percent. Instead, it grew 40 percent, short of what investors expected. Without the strengthening dollar, the company’s two main enterprise lines of business, which it calls Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud, would have met the initial guidance it provided investors in April.
“Commercial demand overall felt pretty healthy,” Brett Iversen, Microsoft’s head of investor relations, said in an interview on Tuesday. “The long-term thesis of people wanting to move to the cloud to digitize their business, to be able to do more or to be able to save money — all of that still feels intact.”
He said that was reflected in strong long-term bookings commitments, including a record number of Azure deals worth more than $1 billion.

Overall revenue for Microsoft’s commercial cloud computing offerings, which also includes Office 365 subscriptions, increased 28 percent to $25 billion.
“We are not immune to what is happening in the macro broadly,” Satya Nadella, the company’s chief executive, said in a call with Wall Street analysts. But he said the continued interest that businesses have in using cloud services, which bills in part based on consumption, reflects companies efforts to make do with less.
“Moving to the cloud is the best way to shape your spend with demand uncertainty,” he said.
Microsoft’s personal computing business grew 2 percent to $14.4 billion, dragged down by the 2 percent decline in sales of its Windows operating system that comes preinstalled on personal computers. Investors were prepared to see some weakness because shipments of PCs are down from weakened demand and supply chain problems brought on by coronavirus lockdowns in China.
Revenue from Xbox content and services fell 6 percent, as consumers spent less time playing video games.
With unemployment remaining near the lowest levels in 50 years, LinkedIn, the professional social network Microsoft bought in 2016, grew 26 percent, down from 34 percent growth the previous quarter.

The company said it had $126 million in expenses related to scaling down its operations in Russia, and another $113 million in costs for paying severance to employees it laid off.
Mr. Iversen said the layoffs were for “a small number of roles” and the company expected to expand its head count in the new fiscal year, which started July 1.
In the call with Wall Street analysts, Mr. Nadella and Amy Hood, Microsoft’s finance chief, said beyond the strong dollar, the company expected some challenges to persist, such as reduced demand for personal computers, fewer paid job postings on LinkedIn and lower demand from small- and medium-size businesses.
But they said Microsoft would continue investing in markets where it has advantages and expected double-digit revenue growth in the next year, even if foreign exchange headwinds continued. The company’s share price increased about 5 percent in after market trading."

What tech earnings say about the economy
The long-booming bottom lines of major tech companies are all of a sudden smaller than expected. That might be a good thing. Big Tech sailed through the pandemic with its profits mostly intact. The fact that some firms’ results are now flagging could be a positive sign for the Federal Reserve, which is trying to engineer a slowdown as it fights the nation’s worst bout of inflation in four decades.
The big question for investors, and perhaps the Fed, is whether the profits of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and the other tech giants, along with corporate America in general, have fallen enough.
Microsoft and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, kicked off what appears to be a disappointing round of quarterly reports for the U.S.’s largest tech companies yesterday. Meta will release its results this afternoon, with Apple and Amazon rounding out Big Tech’s earnings announcements tomorrow.
Microsoft’s profits, while below expectations, were still up. Sales of its signature software products, like Office, rose 13 percent. Its cloud services were up 40 percent. And LinkedIn, the professional social network Microsoft bought in 2016, grew 26 percent from a year ago, continuing to benefit from the tightest job market in decades.
Alphabet’s sales rose 13 percent. In another good sign for the economy, the jump was driven by better-than-expected sales in its core Google search engine business, while results were mixed elsewhere. A jump in expenses and an exit from its Russian-related businesses caused profits to slump 14 percent.
The results were positive enough for investors. Alphabet’s shares rose nearly 5 percent on the earnings news to $110. Microsoft’s shares jumped $10, or nearly 4 percent, to $262. Executives at both companies said they saw evidence of a weaker economy. “We are not immune to what is happening in the macro broadly,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts. Alphabet’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told analysts that a pullback in spending by some advertisers reflected “uncertainty about a number of factors.”
Few are betting that the earnings reports will change the Fed’s approach. Its policymakers are meeting this week, and they are widely expected to continue raising benchmark interest rates. While central bankers “will likely acknowledge a recent weakening in economic momentum, the Fed will likely feel the need to appear resolute in battling inflation until there are clear signs that it is abating,” wrote David Kelly, the chief global strategist of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a note to clients earlier this week.

Cathie Wood’s Ark funds reportedly dumped Coinbase shares yesterday for the first time this year.
Antitrust legislation aimed at Big Tech may be off the table for now. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told donors at a Capitol Hill fund-raiser yesterday that the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which he had promised to bring to a vote this summer, lacks the support needed to get it to the Senate floor, Bloomberg reported. The bill’s bipartisan backers have been pressuring Schumer to act fast, before midterm elections that could change the balance of power in Congress.
One America News, once a dependable Trump promoter, is struggling to survive. The network is being dropped by major carriers and faces a wave of defamation lawsuits for its outlandish stories about the 2020 election. OAN’s most recent blow is from Verizon, which will stop carrying the network on its Fios television service this week. It is now available to only a few thousand people who subscribe to regional cable providers.
Teva Pharmaceuticals reaches a tentative $4.25 billion settlement over opioids. The proposed settlement, which is with some 2,500 local governments, states and tribes, would end thousands of lawsuits against one of the largest producers of the painkillers during the height of the opioid epidemic.

Florida Power & Light bankrolled and controlled The Capitolist, a news site aimed at Florida lawmakers, through intermediaries from an Alabama consulting firm, an investigation by The Miami Herald found. The site claimed to be independent, but it advocated rate hikes and legislative favors in efforts that were directed by top executives at the utility.

BlackRock downshifts on E.S.G.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, slashed its support for shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues this year, backing only 24 percent of such resolutions in the proxy season that ended in June, down from 43 percent in the previous period. The firm, which has long led the conscious investing movement, said this year’s proposals were “less supportable” and cited new regulatory guidance that opened the door to a broader range of policy-related proposals.

The firm has criticized overly “prescriptive” resolutions. In a May memo, BlackRock signaled that Russia’s war in Ukraine was straining global energy supplies and shifting its calculations. “Many climate-related shareholder proposals sought to dictate the pace of companies’ energy transition plans despite continued consumer demand,” wrote the firm’s global head of investment stewardship, Sandy Boss. She noted that shareholders generally supported fewer environmental and social proposals this year as well, voting for 27 percent of resolutions, down from 36 percent in the previous proxy period.

Opposition to E.S.G. is mounting. The environmental, social and governance investment push has been labeled “woke capitalism” by critics and is under fire from executives like Tesla’s Elon Musk, major investors like Bill Ackman and Republican politicians. In a speech yesterday, former Vice President Mike Pence, a possible 2024 hopeful, said that big government and big business were together advancing a “pernicious woke agenda.”
E.S.G. supporters say critics may have a point. Andrew Behar, C.E.O. of the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, agrees that many supposed E.S.G. investments don’t reflect true sustainability — with ever more capital directed toward the idea and many funds failing to live up to their promises. Behar argued that more corporate disclosures — which anti-E.S.G. groups oppose — would help to ensure that green investing actually works. He argues that critics also ignore a key financial incentive driving investor interest: knowing and lowering the costs of environmental issues throughout company operations, including risks from changing weather and the transition to more sustainable models. “We don’t have an E.S.G. problem,” Behar told DealBook. “We have a naming problem.”

Instagram tries to explain itself
Instagram responded yesterday to criticism from some of its most popular users, including Kylie Jenner, about new features that made it more like its top rival, TikTok, the fast-growing video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Adam Mosseri, Instagram’s head, said that it was experimenting with several changes, and that he knew users were unhappy. “It’s not yet good,” he said of some of the tweaks in a video post. He stressed Instagram’s commitment to photos, the app’s original focus, but said, “I’m going to be honest, I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time.”
Reels, a short-video product, is one of the six main investment priorities at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, according to an internal memo last month from Chris Cox, the company’s chief product officer. Cox said that users had doubled the amount of time they spent on Reels year over year, and that Meta would prioritize boosting ads in Reels “as quickly as possible.” Last week, Instagram announced that almost all videos in the app would be posted as Reels.
The changes come as Meta heads into a new phase. Mark Zuckerberg, its founder and chief executive, has cut costs, reshuffled his leadership team and made clear that low-performing employees will be let go, writes The Times’s Mike Isaac. “Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” Zuckerberg said on a call late last month. In recent months, profit at Meta has fallen and revenue has slowed as the company has spent lavishly on augmented and virtual reality projects, and as the economic slowdown has hurt its advertising business.
The high-profile complaints about Instagram’s revamp started in recent days, when Kylie Jenner, the beauty mogul with 361 million Instagram followers, shared an image on the site that read: “Make Instagram Instagram again. (stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.”
“PRETTY PLEASE,” Kim Kardashian, Jenner’s half sister and the seventh-most-followed Instagram user, echoed in a later post. Yesterday, Chrissy Teigen, a model and author with 39 million followers, responded to Mosseri in a tweet, saying, “we don’t wanna make videos Adam lol.”
Companies have reason to listen when social media stars speak up, writes The Times’s Kalley Huang. In 2018, after Snapchat overhauled its interface, Jenner tweeted: “sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me….” Within a week, Snap, the app’s parent company, had lost $1.3 billion in market value.

2022-07-28,"No boom can last forever, even for the technology industry’s most affluent companies. Investors punished the biggest tech companies earlier this year, erasing $2 trillion in market value over fears the industry would falter in the face of rising inflation and a slowing economy.
But this week, as the United States reported that economic output fell for the second straight quarter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple posted sales and profits that showed their businesses have the dominance and diversity to defy the economic woes hurting smaller companies.
Microsoft and Amazon proved that their lucrative cloud businesses were continuing to expand even as the economy cools. Alphabet’s subsidiary, Google, demonstrated that search advertisements remained in demand among travel companies and retailers. And Apple papered over a downturn in its device business by increasing its sales of apps and subscription services.
Collectively, it was a sign that tech may have already hit a bottom and is beginning to rebound, said Dave Harden, the chief investment officer at Summit Global, a firm near Salt Lake City with about $2 billion under investment that counts Apple among its holdings.

“These guys are still delivering,” Mr. Harden said. “They’re acting responsibly and navigating through a choppy period.”
The better-than-feared results lifted the companies’ share prices and provided a jolt to the stock market, even as Alphabet and Microsoft fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.
The results made clear that the companies are not immune to problems such as supply-chain disruptions, rising costs and shifts in customer spending. But their giant businesses are not as vulnerable to the various challenges sweeping across the economy as smaller companies like Twitter and Snap, the owner of Snapchat.
During calls with analysts, the companies’ chief executives cautioned investors about the months ahead, using words like “challenges” and “uncertainty.” Concerns about the economy are leading some of them, including Alphabet, to slow the pace of hiring and take other precautions, but none have said they plan to begin making layoffs.

Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s chief executive, cast the slowing economy as an opportunity, saying the company would sharpen its focus and “be more disciplined as we go forward.” He added, “When you’re in growth mode, it’s tough to always take the time to do all the readjustments you need to do and moments like this give us a chance.”

In what many investors interpreted as a testament to the industry’s optimism, Microsoft said it expected double-digit revenue growth for the next year, and Amazon said it expected sales to increase at least 13 percent in the current quarter.

Satya Nadella, the chief executive officer at Microsoft, said the company would invest over the year to take share and build its businesses, while Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s finance chief, said it would have more product in stock and speedier deliveries.
“That’s not a recession forecast,” said Sean Stannard-Stockton, president of Ensemble Capital, a San Francisco-based investment firm with $1.3 billion under management. “If we do avoid a severe recession, it’s clear that a lot of these businesses will see growth rate pick back up.”
Though Apple and Alphabet didn’t provide guidance, the companies bought back tens of billions of dollars in stock during the period. Apple’s purchase of $21.7 billion and Alphabet’s purchase of $15.2 billion testified to the companies’ belief that their businesses will continue to grow in the years ahead.

Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, was an outlier among the biggest tech companies, reporting its first decline in quarterly revenue since going public a decade ago. Its woes were an outgrowth of rising competition from TikTok, which has sapped it of users and advertisers, and challenges from privacy changes on iPhones implemented by Apple.
The advertising market is forecast to grow 8.4 percent this year and 6.4 percent in 2023, according to GroupM, a market research firm. Facebook’s sales growth last year, when quarterly sales jumped 56 percent, made it “implausible to keep growing,” said Brian Wieser, president of business intelligence at GroupM.
Similar challenges have hit the e-commerce market. Convinced that a surge in online orders during the pandemic represented a fundamental change in the way people shopped, Amazon advanced an ambitious plan to open dozens of new warehouses. But as sales have cooled — with the number of items it sold up just 1 percent in the most recent quarter — it has reversed course and decided to close, delay or cancel at least 35 warehouse openings.
Amazon’s smaller e-commerce rival, Shopify, said it would cut about 10 percent of its staff. Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify, said this year would be “a transition year in which e-commerce is largely reset” to the growth levels it recorded before Covid-19.
Apple’s biggest obstacle came from its dependency on China to manufacture most of its devices. In April, the company said it would lose about $4 billion in sales because of factory shutdowns in Shanghai, where it manufactures iPads and Macs. But it still managed to increase its sales of iPhones in the period by 3 percent and set a quarterly record for the number of people who traded Android smartphones for iPhones.

Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said that Apple saw “a cocktail of headwinds,” including the supply constraints, the strengthening dollar that increased device prices overseas and the slowing global economy.
“When you think about the number of challenges in the quarter, we feel really good about the growth that we put up,” Mr. Cook said. He added that the company would invest through a downturn, but be “deliberate in doing so in recognition of the realities of the environment.”"
2022-07-29,"Consumers are gloomy, the economy is shrinking, the Federal Reserve wants it to keep slowing and economists now say the whole world could be sliding toward recession.
At the same time, a lot of strong numbers are still coming out of many large American companies, which have been releasing their quarterly earnings reports and discussing their outlooks with Wall Street.
“We had an outstanding quarter,” Stephen Squeri, the chief executive of American Express, said after the company reported record revenue. “As our second-quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of,” said Christopher Nassetta, chief executive of Hilton Worldwide, noting that revenue per room in most major regions of the world was now above 2019 levels.
The blustery corporate optimism may seem at odds with the Fed’s grim determination to hold back the economy to get inflation down. But the economy is both what the Fed does and how companies and consumers are behaving. And the full picture of this strange economic moment is perhaps better captured by considering both sides together, central bankers and C.E.O.s, no matter how divergent they seem.

Some big companies — Meta, for example — have reported disappointing numbers, and their chief executives are downbeat about the future. Other tech giants, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft included, all released results that, while hardly stellar, were enough to persuade investors that their businesses were not falling off a cliff.
Indeed, so far, with roughly half of all large companies having reported their numbers, this earnings season has not provided much evidence that the economy is entering a big crackup, and almost no chief executives talked about doing mass layoffs on earnings calls.
The lack of really bad news in earnings in part explains why the S&P 500 stock index has bounced about 12 percent from its low point in June, and why Wall Street analysts still predict that earnings for the companies in the S&P 500 will grow 10 percent this year, according to data from FactSet. Though much of that growth is expected to come from energy companies, which have benefited from higher oil and gas prices, analysts expect profits to rise in eight of the 11 industries represented in the index.
It’s an awfully rosy picture when “recession” is on people’s minds. That’s why for some on Wall Street, that optimism is absurd. Michael Burry, the investor who foresaw the 2008 mortgage meltdown, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that the earnings reports coming in felt like a “last hurrah.”
Not done with fighting inflation, central banks are expected to continue pushing up the cost of borrowing, which would make corporate investments more expensive and dampen demand for companies’ products and services. Europe, a big market for U.S. corporations, could have a nightmare winter if natural gas prices continue rising. And supply chains are still dysfunctional for many companies, meaning they can’t even make and sell products for which there is demand.

“All those headwinds that created the downturn, they’re still intact and arguably getting worse,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.
Things could go into reverse quickly, the pessimists say. Many companies have for some time lived in a sort of nirvana in which they could keep hoisting their prices and customers would keep paying them, creating blowout profits.
Now there are signs that consumers are balking at what companies charge, and if they pull back hard, their sales and earnings could take a big hit and lead chief executives to lay off workers and slash investments to protect profit margins and balance sheets. Early signs of this dynamic are emerging, according to some analysts.
Home-building companies, for instance, have been able to sell homes at ever higher prices over the past two years, but as the Fed has raised interest rates, their senior executives say demand has fallen.
PulteGroup, a large home builder that reported earnings this past week, said the average price of its homes in the second quarter was $531,000, a 19 percent increase from a year earlier. The company forecast that the average would keep rising this year. At the same time, Pulte said, net new orders plunged 23 percent from a year earlier, which the company blamed on the increase in mortgage rates.

“We’ll have to see how well the sector is able to hold on to those price increases that they’ve accumulated over the last couple of years,” said Brian Barnhurst, co-head of credit research for PGIM Fixed Income, a division of Prudential, referring to home builders.
Pulte did not respond to requests for comment.
While well-off consumers show few signs of cutting back, the second-quarter earnings contain plenty of evidence that some households are getting squeezed as inflation pushes up their bills.
AT&T said its customers were taking two days longer on average to pay their bills, which caused a hit to the phone company’s second-quarter cash flow of almost $1 billion. The company’s chief executive, John Stankey, said on the earnings call that bad-debt levels were slightly higher than before the pandemic. But he added, “We view this cycle no differently and still expect customers will pay their bills, albeit a little less timely.”
On the earnings call for McDonald’s, the company’s chief financial officer said some of its customers were choosing “value” offerings over others. On Chipotle’s earnings call, its chief executive, Brian Niccol, said: “The low-income consumer definitely has pulled back their purchase frequency. Fortunately, for Chipotle, that is not the majority of our customers.”
Big retailers like Walmart have said their customers are spending so much on must-have items like food and fuel that they’re eschewing higher-cost merchandise, like clothes and home goods. Since shoppers are still spending at Walmart for the staples, the company — and to a certain extent, the economy — still benefits from their purchases, though the shift has hit its profit margins and helped pummel its stock.

Banks earnings are a good place to get an early read on how consumers are faring. Overall, there are few signs at lenders that borrowers are having trouble repaying their loans, analysts say.
“You would have come away from the quarterly earnings thinking that the consumer was generally in good shape,” said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst who covers finance companies at Credit Suisse.
Because of pandemic stimulus payments, low unemployment and rising wages, the levels of past-due loans and bad debt fell to historical lows, but lenders have expected them to rise as borrowers reduce cash holdings and their balance sheets look more like they did before the pandemic. The finance industry has started calling that process “normalization.”
It appears to have begun among lower-income borrowers.
Richard Fairbank, the chief executive of Capital One, a big credit card lender, said on the company’s earnings call that this normalization was more evident in the bank’s subprime loans than in those made to borrowers with stronger credit. But Capital One declined to provide past-due loan numbers for its subprime loans, making it impossible to chart the extent of any deterioration.
In its earnings report, Ally Bank, a big auto loan maker, provided data on past-due auto loans in the second quarter for borrowers at a range of income levels. Past-due loans were either at or close to prepandemic levels for borrowers with lower incomes.

Ally declined to provide the same data for earlier quarters, making it impossible to know how quickly past-due loans might have risen. On its earnings call, Jenn LaClair, Ally’s chief financial officer, said, “We have continued to invest in talent and technology to enhance our servicing and collection capabilities and remain confident in our ability to effectively manage credit in a variety of environments.”
Some analysts think the pullback in spending could spread to wealthier households.
“You’re going to see it go up the income scale as the year unfolds with people sitting there, saying, ‘I’ll go without rather than spend this much on that’ or ‘I’ll trade down to something more affordable,’” said Mr. O’Rourke, the JonesTrading strategist. He added that he was waiting for earnings from Macy’s and Nordstrom, which are scheduled to report in August, to see if that was happening.
The concern is that the heavy summer spending that has recently bolstered the earnings of the hospitality industries and the airlines is not sustainable. “There’s a faction of the market that’s quite convinced that when we get to the fall and the bills from the summer spending come home to roost, the consumer will be in a much trickier spot,” Mr. Barnhurst of PGIM said.
An exchange this earnings season reveals how chief executives and companies can keep the economy going, even when they fear that a downturn may be at hand.
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned in May that storm clouds were gathering over the economy. On JPMorgan’s second-quarter earnings call, Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo, asked Mr. Dimon why the bank had committed to investing such large sums this year if things could turn dire.

“It’s like you’re acting like there’s sunny skies ahead,” Mr. Mayo said, “You’re out buying kayaks, surfboards, wave runners just before the storm. So is it tough times or not?”
Mr. Dimon’s response: “We’ve always run the company consistently, investing, doing this stuff through storms.”"

2022-08-02,"One of the first moves the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery made when it took over CNN was shutting down CNN+, the nascent streaming service that was touted as the network’s bridge to the future.
The next month, when Chris Licht took over as CNN’s chairman, he told employees in his first town hall meeting not to worry about ratings, a mainstay of TV news used as a benchmark for revenue and relevance.
Now, three months into Mr. Licht’s tenure, the network finds itself facing big questions about how it can continue to expand its business with its moonshot streaming service dead and the traditional TV business in structural decline.
Projections from S&P Global Market Intelligence say CNN’s profitability is on a pace to decline to $956.8 million this year. That would mark the first time since 2016 that the network had dipped below $1 billion in profit, according to three people familiar with its operations.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Two people familiar with CNN’s operations said the network’s initial 2022 profitability target was $1.1 billion, which Mr. Licht is on track to miss by more than $100 million. But another person familiar with the matter said that by the accounting of company executives, Mr. Licht was on track to meet a profitability target of roughly $950 million for the year, since the network’s initial budget didn’t account for losses associated with launching the CNN+ streaming service.
However the numbers are crunched, inside CNN the hunt is on for new revenue. To help solve the financial puzzle, Mr. Licht has tapped Chris Marlin, a longtime friend who was recently an executive at the Florida home builder Lennar. Mr. Marlin — whom some CNN employees have taken to calling “Fish Man,” a takeoff on his surname — had no experience operating a cable news network, having worked at the law firms Foley & Lardner and Holland & Knight.
Mr. Marlin has floated a variety of revenue-generating ideas since joining CNN, including striking advertising deals with major tech companies like Microsoft. Mr. Marlin has also mentioned selling sponsorships to corporate underwriters, extending CNN’s brand in China and expanding CNN Underscored, an e-commerce initiative.
CNN’s parent has also cracked down on expenses. In July, CNN employees received a revised travel and expense policy that, among other things, restricts spending on work celebrations for senior vice presidents and below to $50 per person (“no cap for C.E.O. of W.B.D.,” the policy reads). And Mr. Licht has found ways to make coverage more economical, including a recent decision not to send a U.S.-based special events team to Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee.
Mr. Licht, who took over CNN in May after a corporate merger made Warner Bros. Discovery its parent company, has tried to sell its staff on a vision for the network that isn’t tethered to traditional TV ratings. During a meeting with employees his first week, Mr. Licht said CNN would generate revenue by pitching advertisers on the network’s “pristine brand,” not just sheer audience size, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by The New York Times.

“I don’t want producers making decisions based on what they think will rate,” Mr. Licht said, according to the recording.

A CNN spokesman said Mr. Licht was also focused on expanding the network’s traditional TV viewership, describing his recommendations to producers as “editorial guidance” rather than “business strategy.” The spokesman said Mr. Licht had not yet put his stamp on the network’s programming, adding that Mr. Licht projects the network’s profits will increase in 2023.
Ratings are down from their Trump-era heights across cable news, but declines at CNN are particularly pronounced. The network has drawn an average of 639,000 people in prime time this quarter, according to data from Nielsen, a 27 percent decrease from a year ago. It trails MSNBC, which is down 23 percent in prime time during the same period, and Fox News, where viewership is up about 1 percent.
CNN has spent millions covering the war in Ukraine, two people familiar with its operations said, and the network is still paying some costs associated with CNN+, such as the salaries of high-profile journalists like Chris Wallace and Audie Cornish, which have also weighed on the bottom line.

The network is trying to defray costs associated with CNN+ by selling some of the programming created for the streaming service to other providers, including HBO Max, which Warner Bros. Discovery also owns.
Executives at CNN’s corporate parent are examining the media empire — which includes the Turner cable networks and channels like Food Network — to find roughly $3 billion in cost savings.
But Mr. Licht told employees at the town hall meeting in May that he didn’t expect Warner Bros. Discovery to impose additional layoffs at CNN after the shutdown of CNN+.
“No one has said to me, ‘You’re going to have to go cut this,’” Mr. Licht said, according to the recording. “I think there’s an acute understanding that they don’t know our business.”
The bulk of CNN’s revenue comes from long-term subscription deals with cable companies and from traditional TV advertising revenue, said Steve Cahall, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo. When those advertisers make spending decisions, they are concerned primarily with total audience size, Mr. Cahall said.
“If the strategy delivers more reach — that is, more ratings — then it’s probably a better business,” he said. “If it delivers less reach — if it turns out that the middle is a narrow place to be these days in America — then it’s a less good business strategy.”"
2022-08-03,"Richard Tait, an entrepreneur, business executive and venture capitalist who helped invent the board game Cranium, a familiar part of American family life in the late 1990s and 2000s, died on July 25 at his home in Bainbridge Island, Wash. He was 58.
His son Finn said the cause of death was complications of Covid-19.
In 1997, Richard Tait and his wife at the time, Karen Fries, were vacationing with another couple on Long Island, in the Hamptons, when someone suggested they play a board game. But they could not find a game everyone could enjoy. One couple dominated when they played Pictionary. The other won handily when they switched to Scrabble.
Then Mr. Tait had a thought: What if there was a game that let everyone play to their strengths? His friend Dan Katz, who won the Scrabble game that day, remembers Mr. Tait telling the room: “There has to be a way for everyone to feel comfortable.”
He soon designed a game that was part Pictionary, part Scrabble, part Trivial Pursuit and part Hangman. After sharing the idea with a colleague named Whit Alexander, the two expanded the game, adding mini-competitions that involved charades-like playacting, sculpting shapes from clay and humming popular songs.

“We knew it would not be enough to just ask questions about music,” Mr. Alexander said in an phone interview. “We needed activities that allowed people to show their musical intelligence.”

The result was Cranium. Over the next decade, with help from two novel means of distribution — Amazon.com and the Starbucks coffee shop chain — they sold more than 44 million copies of the game and its sister titles in 22 countries before their company was acquired by the game and toy giant Hasbro.
“Cranium was — I am going to say it — a game changer,” said Chris Byrne, who was part of the team that launched Pictionary and is now a game and toy consultant known as The Toy Guy. “It revolutionized game play — and the social aspects of game play — for much of a generation.”
Richard John Tait was born on Jan. 17, 1964, at his home in Broughty Ferry, Scotland, a village on the north bank of the River Tay as it flows into the North Sea. His father, Thomas, was an executive at the Polaroid camera and technology company. His mother, Kathleen, worked part time as a secretary and receptionist at medical offices in Broughty Ferry and later in Helensburgh, about 90 miles to the southwest, where the family moved in the 1970s.

Mr. Tait studied computer science as an undergraduate at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh before moving to the United States, where he earned a master’s degree at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. When he finished his M.B.A., he took a job with Microsoft, in the suburbs of Seattle, just as that software maker was growing into one of the world’s most powerful corporations. Not long after, he hired one of the company’s most notable employees: the future chief executive and chairman Satya Nadella.
In the 1990s, during the heyday of multimedia CD-ROMs, Mr. Tait oversaw Microsoft’s catalog of reference titles, including the Encarta encyclopedia and Bookshelf, a catchall collection spanning Roget’s Thesaurus, The American Heritage Dictionary, Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations and The Chicago Manual of Style. He eventually became a kind of entrepreneur-in-residence at the company, launching five new internet businesses inside Microsoft within four years, including Carpoint, a car-buying service, and Sidewalk, an online city guide.
He left the company in 1997, hoping to become a radio disc jockey on the strength of his Scottish brogue. But after a failed audition, he decided to develop Cranium, building a new company, Cranium Inc., with Mr. Alexander, a former Microsoft colleague.
When they finished creating the game in late 1998, game stores and other traditional retailers had already stocked their shelves for the holiday buying season. But one afternoon, when they met for coffee at a Starbucks in Seattle, Mr. Tait had another thought: What if they sold the game through the coffee shop chain?
“His idea was to sell the game not where games were sold but where our customers were,” Mr. Alexander said. “Most of the people we were going for would never set foot in a game store.”

Through an acquaintance, Mr. Tait arranged a meeting with Starbucks’s chief executive, Howard Schultz, and soon Starbucks was selling Cranium in shops across the country. Later, Mr. Tait and Mr. Alexander arranged similar deals with Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, both of which were then known for selling primarily books, not games.
“All successful games break the rules, and this one did, too,” Mr. Byrne said.
After the success of Cranium, their company released dozens of other games and toys, including the children’s games Cadoo and Cariboo. They sold the company to Hasbro for $77.5 million in 2008.
After the sale, Mr. Tait, a lifelong soccer fan, created a soccer-themed energy drink called Golazo — Spanish for “super goal” — but it did not find the same success as Cranium. He later became an entrepreneur-in-residence at Starbucks before joining the Seattle venture capital fund Valor Siren Ventures.
In addition to his son Finn, Mr. Tait is survived by another son, Deacon, and a daughter, Remy, all from his marriage to Ms. Fries, which ended in divorce; two sisters, Louise Tait and Gillian (Tait) Heard; his partner and fiancée, Amy Paron; and her daughter, Bella Paron.
As Mr. Tait envisioned Cranium, he began sketching pictures of the brain. He saw the game as a way of reaching both right-brained people (creative, intuitive types) and left-brained people (analytical, logical types).
That is why he called it Cranium. As the box said, it was “the game for your whole brain.”"

2022-08-05,"Turn on the evening news, and it immediately becomes clear that Americans are experiencing the effects of climate change. Extreme heat and drought are affecting tens of millions of people as floods and wildfires ravage communities from Appalachia to California. In the coming days, Congress has the opportunity to face the climate crisis while strengthening our country’s energy security, creating opportunities for businesses and improving the lives of Americans. We can’t afford to miss it.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may be the single most important piece of climate legislation in American history. It represents our best chance to build an energy future that is cleaner, cheaper and more secure. Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin of West Virginia deserve a lot of credit for reaching this agreement, as do countless others. Many business leaders and activists I’ve gotten to know through Breakthrough Energy, the climate organization I founded in 2015 to accelerate the clean energy transition, have worked relentlessly for decades for this moment. But although it appears the legislation will pass, success is not guaranteed, so it’s critical to keep pushing for it. Let me explain why.
Many of the technologies we’ll need to reach net-zero emissions don’t exist, are in early stages of development or are still too expensive to scale up. At the same time, more mature technologies like solar, wind and electric vehicles must be deployed more quickly in more places. Through new and expanded tax credits and a long-term approach, this bill would ensure that critical climate solutions have sustained support to develop into new industries.
A changing climate, a changing world
Card 1 of 4
Climate change around the world: In “Postcards From a World on Fire,” 193 stories from individual countries show how climate change is reshaping reality everywhere, from dying coral reefs in Fiji to disappearing oases in Morocco and far, far beyond.
The role of our leaders: Writing at the end of 2020, Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, found reasons for optimism in the Biden presidency, a feeling perhaps borne out by the passing of major climate legislation. That doesn’t mean there haven’t been criticisms. For example, Charles Harvey and Kurt House argue that subsidies for climate capture technology will ultimately be a waste.
The worst climate risks, mapped: In this feature, select a country, and we'll break down the climate hazards it faces. In the case of America, our maps, developed with experts, show where extreme heat is causing the most deaths.
What people can do: Justin Gillis and Hal Harvey describe the types of local activism that might be needed, while Saul Griffith points to how Australia shows the way on rooftop solar. Meanwhile, small changes at the office might be one good way to cut significant emissions, writes Carlos Gamarra.
These incentives would also provide the private sector with the confidence to invest for the long term. This legislation would begin to transform the parts of our economy that are hardest to decarbonize, like manufacturing, which we must do to reach net-zero emissions. As many Americans face summer blackouts, power shortages and high electricity bills, these measures would help build a modern, reliable power grid so all can have access to affordable, abundant and clean energy.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
With those incentives and investments, this bill would catalyze a new era of American innovation. The ability of America’s universities and industries to innovate remains second to none, yet the country risks falling behind as other countries race to build their own clean energy economies. This legislation would help turn American energy innovations into American energy industries and unlock huge economic opportunities in the energy market. If it becomes law, few nations would have the capacity for producing homegrown clean energy like the United States. America could quickly become a leader in the deployment of clean energy at the scale required.
American businesses are ready for this change. I’ve spoken with corporate leaders who are eager for our government to act. Many have made big climate pledges and invested significant amounts in clean energy, both because they care about making good on their promises and because it’s good business. Even more businesses are waiting on the sidelines for a strong signal from government that clean industries are a solid long-term investment. Passing the Inflation Reduction Act would send that message and enable private capital to supercharge our clean energy future with even greater confidence.
With President Biden’s signature, this legislation would jump-start and support clean energy industries that could create millions of jobs, many in communities that have been built by fossil fuels. In fact, many of the most promising technologies in the clean energy economy will require similar skills and expertise possessed by today’s coal, oil and gas workers. This will help ensure a fair transition.
Solving climate change is perhaps the hardest challenge humanity has ever faced. It will require fundamentally transforming how we power our communities, move goods, build things, heat and cool buildings and grow food — basically how we do everything. We need to do it rapidly with a cohesive and coherent plan if we want to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

The country has an opportunity to set an example by offering a vision of what’s possible — and then by making it happen. By passing this legislation, Congress would mark a moment when, despite the many challenges facing the nation, lawmakers in Washington acted with ambition and foresight to build a cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous future. Let’s get it done.

2022-08-11,"ValueAct, an activist investor that has taken stakes in major companies including Microsoft, Reuters and 21st Century Fox, said on Thursday that it had bought nearly 7 percent of The New York Times Company’s common stock and would push for changes to some of the publisher’s business operations.
The purchase of the stock, made public in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, makes ValueAct one of the largest shareholders in The Times, alongside Vanguard and BlackRock Fund Advisors. The Times is controlled by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which limits the influence outside investors have on the company.
Shares of The Times, which are down about 27 percent year to date, jumped more than 10 percent on news of ValueAct’s investment, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
In a letter to its investors on Thursday, ValueAct said it had conducted research that showed many consumers were not aware that The Times sells a bundled subscription to its products, which include news, games, a cooking app and the sports publication The Athletic. ValueAct said that created a potential growth opportunity.

“This is an opportunity we believe management needs to drive with urgency, as it is the biggest lever to accelerate growth, deepen NYT’s competitive moat, and ensure the long-term strength and stability of the platform,” ValueAct said in the letter, according to a person with knowledge of its contents.
The Times has 9.17 million paid subscribers. It has a goal of signing up 15 million by the end of 2027.
The Times Company has a dual-class share structure. The shares used to elect the majority of the company’s board, called Class B, are controlled by a trust for the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which owns 95 percent of these shares. The family has controlled the business since Adolph Ochs purchased it in 1896. The 13-person board is chaired by A.G. Sulzberger, who is also the publisher of The Times.
Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said in a statement that members of the company’s management team had held conversations with ValueAct to exchange views.
“The board and management team will continue to make decisions that we believe are in the best interest of the company and all company shareholders,” Ms. Ha said in the statement.

Unlike some other activist investors — like Carl Icahn, who made a name for himself with bruising courtroom battles — ValueAct has a track record of investing in companies over a long period and working with management behind the scenes. Often it seeks out companies, like Adobe and Microsoft, that are in the middle of changing their business models.
Activist investors have been increasingly willing to take stakes in companies with dual-class structures like The Times. The activist firm Elliott Management revealed a position in the social media company Pinterest in August, and the activist firm Blackwells Capital pushed for the ouster of the chief executive of Peloton, John Foley, this spring.
The Times has dealt with activist investors before. In 2008, the hedge funds Harbinger Capital Partners and Firebrand Partners told the company they intended to nominate four independent directors to the publisher’s board. The Times ultimately struck a deal with the investment firms, offering up two board seats."
2022-08-12,"GREEN BAY, Wis. — It takes a certain type of Packers fan to tailgate outside Lambeau Field at sunrise months before the team’s season kicks off. But Tom Rozum isn’t an ordinary fan: He’s a Packers shareholder who last month was preparing to attend the team’s annual shareholder meeting, a rite unique to the N.F.L.’s only publicly owned team.
After Bloody Marys with family and friends, Rozum joined more than 8,000 other team shareholders in the stadium on a weekday morning last month to hear the Packers’ president, general manager and board members address the state of the fabled franchise.
“We can see where our money is going to,” joked Rozum, who lives nearby and circles the stadium daily to get to 10,000 steps. “Today, you can walk around like you own the place.”
Rozum’s shares, and those of the team’s other 539,000 shareholders, pay no dividends and cannot be traded. Their only benefits are a chance to buy shareholder-only swag and attending this two-hour annual meeting that is a cross between a dutiful accounting of the team, a pep rally and an inside joke.

Though largely worthless, the shares let fans dream that they have a voice in a team that plays in a league dominated by billionaire team owners. Many fans at the meeting viewed the Packers not as America’s Team, as the flashy Dallas Cowboys call themselves, but as Americana’s Team, a franchise that harkens back to when many N.F.L. teams were based in smaller factory towns and Vince Lombardi won championships by deploying a brand of smash-mouth football that’s no longer en vogue.
The reality is that the fans’ willingness to pay $300 for a frameable certificate helps the Packers compete with teams in far larger cities with deep-pocketed owners who can spend freely on bells and whistles such as top-rate facilities to lure the best free agents and stadiums to attract well-heeled fans.
“This is like Christmas in July,” said Keith Cox, 50, a new shareholder who drove 15 hours from Clarkesville, Ga., with his son, Jordan, 20, to attend the meeting.

“It’s a privilege to say I own a fraction of the team,” Jordan added.
At the meeting, Mark Murphy, the team’s president, told the shareholders to give themselves a round of applause for helping raise $65 million in a stock sale during the winter.

Murphy said the windfall will go toward the more than $200 million being spent on new infrastructure, including larger video boards, concourse renovations and a second generator to power it all. “It’s not very sexy, is it? But we need it,” he joked. The players and coaches will also get a new training facility with underground parking.
Because the Packers are publicly owned, the team must release annual financial figures that provide a window into all 32 teams, much to the consternation of every other owner who tries to keep prying eyes from learning the specifics of their wealth.
And this year, the picture is bright. The Packers generated a record $579 million in revenue last year, a 56 percent increase, as fans returned to games after pandemic-related restrictions were lifted.
Nearly 60 percent of that revenue, or $347.3 million, came from the Packers’ share of the league’s growing media and sponsorship contracts, which are divided among all 32 clubs. The shared revenue grew 12.3 percent last year and is so robust that every team is guaranteed to turn a profit regardless of on-field performance because their biggest expense — player payroll — was capped at just $188 million last year.
The 10-year labor agreement the N.F.L. signed with the players’ union in 2020 added a 17th regular season game, another money stream. New revenue from sports gambling partnerships is starting to pour in. The 2021 renewal of broadcasting rights agreements worth more than $100 billion over the next decade has also started to kick in.

The financial outlook in pro football is so bright that the value of franchises continues a precipitous rise: The Denver Broncos this year sold for $4.65 billion, a record for an American sports team.
“It just seems like a blessed time to be an N.F.L. owner,” said Andrew Brandt, who negotiated player contracts for the Packers from 1999 to 2008 and now runs the sports law program at Villanova University. “Not only is the money staggering, but it’s the length of the deals because when you invest in something, you want security in length. So yeah, it’s a booming business.”

The Packers, though, play in one of the league’s smallest television markets, so the team works harder than most to generate money at home. Local revenue hit $232 million last year thanks to fans returning to Lambeau Field. With money piling back up, the team did not have to dip into its $440 million reserve fund.
“This is kind of our alternative to having a rich owner, nothing against rich owners,” Murphy said.
The Packers are not shy about selling their history to attain money that they do not have to share with other teams and that can be used to pay for their own initiatives. Tours of Lambeau Field cost as much as $67, and the pro shop and 1919 Kitchen & Tap, a bar inside the stadium, is often packed. The Packers recently issued a four-volume history of the team that sells for $99.

Like many other N.F.L. teams that have developed commercial real estate around their facilities — such as the New England Patriots, the Cowboys and the Los Angeles Rams — the Packers are working with other companies to turn the 45 acres immediately west of the stadium into a residential and commercial development called Titletown, a nod to the team’s league-leading 13 championships.
When the project is fully completed, the Packers and their partners will have invested $300 million. So far, two-thirds of the 152 apartments are leased, including to some players, and the team has sold about half of the 50 or so townhouses it plans to build. Nearly 80 percent of the office space is rented. The team does not release specific financial figures, but it said the investments are now profitable.
Among the offices facing Lambeau Field are those of some of the nearly two dozen tech start-ups in which the team has invested. The Packers and Microsoft each contributed $5 million to a $25 million fund to incubate emerging businesses that focus on health care; sports media and entertainment; supply-chain technology; construction and agriculture; and the environment, areas that overlap with industries in Wisconsin. If the start-ups are acquired or go public, the Packers will receive a share of the proceeds.
Craig Dickman, a managing director at TitletownTech, the start-up venture capital fund, said the Packers “have this unique ability to convene,” referring to the team having enlisted university professors and business mentors to help the new businesses.
One of those businesses, Oculogica, created a device, called an EyeBOX, that tracks eye movement to help diagnose brain injuries, including concussions. The company, run by Rosina and Uzma Samadani, sisters who grew up in Beaver Dam, Wis., near Madison, had its EyeBOX approved by the F.D.A. and they are being used by hospitals throughout the country.

The Samadanis said the Packers viewed their technology as a potential aid in treating the concussion crisis that has plagued football, and said it has wider applications in emergency rooms, on battlefields and elsewhere.

“I don’t know if there’s another N.F.L. team that would invest in a concussion diagnostic company,” Rosina Samadani said. “At the end of the day, that really says something about their being tied into the community and that they haven’t lost sight of what’s really happening in the world.”
Those ties to the community are what convinced Chris and Dodie Kocher to drive from Indianapolis to attend the meeting. They spent their honeymoon in Green Bay in 1979 and still love the hometown feel of the team. After their daughter bought them shares this winter, they had to return to Lambeau Field to celebrate.
“It’s a long drive, but it’s worth it,” Chris said."
2022-08-13,"Despite the rocky stock market and the slowing economy, corporate America is sending more money to shareholders than ever before.
The amounts are staggering, which is why these huge sums, sometimes called “windfall profits,” have become a political target.
The landmark climate and tax legislation that now goes to President Biden for his signature includes a new 1 percent tax on buybacks, for example.
Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and Senate majority leader, announced the new tax with a succinct critique. “I hate stock buybacks,” he said. “I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.”
Yet buybacks and dividends are immensely important to investors.
Consider that companies in the S&P 500 will spend more than $500 billion on dividends this year and more than $1 trillion on share buybacks, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s a combined $1.5 trillion, more than ever before.
No wonder these enormous cash flows are capturing attention.
As investors, consumers or just plain citizens of the planet, it’s worth considering the significance of buybacks and dividends — whether they are a form of self-serving corporate profligacy, a wise use of capital or perhaps something in between, as Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, suggests.

2022-08-14,"The top job in this country has gone from the baby boomer Barack Obama to the barely boomer Donald Trump to the throwback Joe Biden, a member of the so-called Silent Generation. At this rate, the presidency may do the natural thing and skip over Generation X entirely.
Wait, you may be asking yourself: Gen Xers are supposed to be in charge now?
It may not seem like it, but do the math: Born between the years 1965 and 1980, Gen Xers are now between the ages of 42 and 57, prime time for being the boss, whether of country, corporation or just a small sales team.
And yet after years of being outnumbered in the work force by boomers (born between 1946 and 1964), Gen Xers have already been overtaken by another, larger cohort: millennials (born between 1981 and 1996). According to a Pew analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, Gen Xers were a majority of the U.S. work force for only a few years — a brief period of dominance ending in 2016.
If Gen Xers are the bosses now, they are the bosses only in a very Gen X way: ambivalently, fleetingly and with dubious authority.

Here’s a refresher on the measliness of Generation X: Our parents were typically members of the Silent Generation, that cohort born between 1928 and 1945 — people shaped by the Great Depression and World War II, people who didn’t get to choose what they were having for dinner and made sure their kids didn’t either. The parents of Gen X believed in spanking and borderline benign neglect, in contrast to the boisterous boomers and their deluxe offspring, the millennial horde.

Grubby Gen Xers were designated the O.G. slackers, which did not bode well for becoming the bosses of the future. It wasn’t our fault! I mean, mostly not. Reality bit for Gen X because when we started to join the work force around 1990, the economy was in a recession; the recovery that followed was sluggish."

2022-08-23,"VANCOUVER — The newest players in Vancouver’s never-ending real estate drama don’t come from across the Pacific or from south of the border. They are the area’s oldest inhabitants, ensconced in this corner of Canada since long before what they call “contact” with European colonizers — and they had long been bystanders as a hyperactive market created fortunes and turned the city into the country’s priciest.
Vancouver’s three local Indigenous communities, called First Nations in Canada, now find themselves in an unusual position. As owners of vast tracts of prime land in a major metropolis, they are courted by developers and poised to continue shaping a city that has been transformed in recent decades by money from Hong Kong and mainland China.
“In the past, we were looking in windows just to be a part of things — we’re now at the table,’’ said Wilson Williams, a councilor and spokesman for the Squamish Nation, which broke ground this month on an 11-tower, 6,000-unit residential project called Senakw on 11 acres across English Bay from downtown Vancouver.

How the Squamish, as well as the Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh nations, got to the table is the result of decades-long legal battles and a tentative union among the three communities over competing land claims. It is also part of the ongoing process of national reckoning and reconciliation over the brutal treatment of Canada’s Indigenous population, which was highlighted again last month by Pope Francis’s apology for his church’s role in that history.

Like their counterparts in the rest of North America, the city’s three Indigenous communities, who altogether number about 7,500 people, were dispossessed of their ancestral lands. But there was a key difference: the authorities in British Columbia never bothered to sign treaties in exchange for most of the Indigenous-held territories.
“The British governor came here and just started taking land away and giving it to his friends without any kind of agreement with local nations,’’ Kennedy Stewart, the mayor of Vancouver, said in an interview. “If you’re applying English common law, you can’t just take people’s land without authority, and so that really set the groundwork for everything.”
British settlers starting taking land from Indigenous communities in Vancouver, beginning in the 1880s and through the 1920s. Now, following decades of court battles, governments have returned or sold back land to the three communities — who have now become, according to the mayor, the “largest developable landowner in this city and probably in the metro area.”
The First Nations have also been given preference as the federal or provincial governments have sold off land they no longer use, including a former military site and the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, where the First Nations are building two new developments.

The First Nations have financed land purchases through loans from the federal government or from banks, sometimes in partnership with private developers eager to build on some of the last swaths of prime land in Vancouver.

Ian Gillespie, the founder and chief executive of Westbank, a major developer involved in Senakw and other Indigenous projects, said that the developments were much more than a real estate story, but one about achieving true reconciliation through the three nations’ acquisition of power.
“Reconciliation isn’t about recognizing what happened and saying, ‘That’s terrible, I’m sorry, let’s move on,’’ Mr. Gillespie said, adding that things will change only when Indigenous communities get power. “Power can come in different forms, but economic power is probably top of the list.’’
“When it comes to real estate in Greater Vancouver, it’s our Microsoft, our Tesla,’’ added Mr. Gillespie, who is not Indigenous. “And so if you can put the First Nations at the center of that, then they are in a position of power.’’

Besides the Squamish-led project called Senakw, the Musqueam Nation has already built about 40 percent of a 1,250-unit development on 21 acres near the University of British Columbia. Called Lelem, its public spaces feature Musqueam art and designs.

But the two projects will be dwarfed by one to develop 90 acres of one of Canada’s most valuable oceanview pieces of property, known as Jericho Lands in West Point Grey, a wealthy neighborhood with beaches and mountain views. The three Indigenous communities are developing Jericho, a former military enclave, together after buying back federal and provincial land under a jointly-owned company formed in 2014, MST Development.
In all, the three communities separately or together have acquired about 175 acres in metro Vancouver in the past eight years, said David Negrin, the chief executive of MST. They are currently negotiating to acquire about a further 100 acres of land on 14 sites from the provincial government and two from the federal government in metro Vancouver, Mr. Negrin added.
“If you look at the land they’ve got back, it’s nothing compared to the land they had,’’ said Mr. Negrin, a high-profile developer hired by the three communities to run MST.

While the communities must now mostly purchase back land they once owned, paying market rates, leaders are pressing for a simple return as another step toward true reconciliation.
“The nations are moving in that direction now, that they’d like to get more of their land back and not pay for it,’’ Mr. Negrin said.

Only in Vancouver have Indigenous communities had so much success.
Across Canada, Indigenous communities have land claims in many other major cities, said Ginger Gosnell-Myers, a former urban and Indigenous planning expert with the Vancouver city government and now a fellow at Simon Fraser University.
“Cities everywhere in this country had First Nation villages that settlers came and stole,’’ said Ms. Gosnell-Myers, a member of the Nisga’a and Kwakwaka’wakw nations. “We don’t have cities across this country by divine intervention. They are there because they were the easiest places to occupy.’’
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Outside Vancouver, few Indigenous communities have succeeded in reclaiming a major piece of city land — in great part because of competing claims by different communities over the same territory, Ms. Gosnell-Myers said.
“Other First Nations with overlapping land claims are not working together, but Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh are, and this is making them unstoppable,’’ she said.
Unity among the three nations took decades to achieve, and they still don’t take it for granted. In fact, claims by the Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh over the 11 acres now being developed by the Squamish contributed to the delay of a final court ruling.
According to First Nation leaders, unity emerged in the past decade following a series of unexpected events.
The three communities, along with the Lil’Wat in Whistler, realized the value of working together in helping host the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

“That’s when the conversations started,’’ said Mr. Williams, the Squamish councilor whose ancestral name is Sxwíxwtn. “Why the four nations? Because the Olympics are on our land, and we were able to put politics aside to be able to work with everyone.’’

Around the same time, members of the three Vancouver communities came together at an emotional funeral for a baby with family ties to all three nations, said Wayne Sparrow, the chief of the Musqueam Nation.
In a series of meetings at the Musqueam longhouse, leaders from the three communities worked through key differences over land. Traditionally, besides family ties, the three communities engaged in cultural and sports activities, and came together at weddings or funerals.
“But when it came to the land, there were always disputes,’’ said Matthew Thomas, economic development officer of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation.

After some “arm-twisting,’’ the three communities agreed to work together on some parcels of land, including the 90-acre Jericho, Mr. Thomas said.
They left unsettled the ownership of other pieces of land.

“So there’s still a lot of work that needs to get done,’’ Chief Sparrow said. “It’s not as rosy as everybody thinks it is.’’
Still, the tentative union allowed the creation in 2014 of MST Development and the purchase of 52 acres of the Jericho Lands, in co-ownership with Canada Lands, the federal government’s real estate arm. MST then purchased 38 acres from the province on its own. It also signaled that the three communities were now a force to reckon with in real estate.
“I got a lot of knocks on the door in the last four years, especially with the profile of MST taking shape,’’ said Stephen Lee, the chief executive officer of Musqueam Capital Corporation, the First Nation’s business arm.

For Indigenous leaders, used to being “out of sight, out of mind’’ in Vancouver, the developments gave them “a sense of being at the table in the past couple of years,” Mr. Williams said.
Vancouver Magazine placed the three communities at the very top of its list of 50 top power brokers early this year, pointing out that the City Council agreed to rename a street — named after the province’s first lieutenant governor whose racist policies harmed the city’s original inhabitants — following a request by the Musqueam.
Some Indigenous leaders said that this newly acquired power was difficult to grasp because their communities had yet to reap the benefits. Chief Sparrow said that perceptions of the communities had begun to change, in part thanks to the magazine ranking.
“It’s very helpful, being recognized to have that amount of power, especially with business,’’ Chief Sparrow said. “Big business people in Vancouver kind of looked and didn’t really acknowledge First Nations. Now, while the government has the legal obligation to consult and accommodate First Nations, I think the business world is getting to that stage.’’"

Re “Townhouses? A Rich Town in Tech Says Nope” (Business, Aug. 15):
Your report about NIMBYism in Atherton, Calif., puts the megawealthy’s hypocrisy on full display. Tech leaders and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley need to walk the walk when it comes to addressing the region’s housing crisis.
While we have many recent examples of tech companies like Cisco, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and LinkedIn taking bold steps to fund affordable housing in our region, we must also guarantee that each of our cities and towns, particularly our most exclusive ones, create affordable homes for all.
A recent study shows that while the Bay Area needs to build nearly 30,000 affordable housing units for low-income families to keep up with the demand, only 3,645 permits for such units have been issued.
So, instead of saying “not in my backyard,” I would urge the residents of Atherton to reconsider.
Open your hearts and the gates to your world. Your influence stretches beyond the charitable gifts you make. Say “yes” to affordable, multifamily housing. In your backyard, too.

You can support hard-working families — good people who want to help build our country and make your city run right — by building much-needed housing in your wonderful community.
You are missing the great good that can come from all this. You will be the loser if you stop new housing from being built, because you could be exposed to different kinds of people — learn their hopes, their fears, their goals.
This could be a great learning experience for you. There is no reason to be afraid of new tenants in your community. I am sure it would enrich and inform your view of the world. Who wants to associate with everybody who is the same — same houses, same work, same food, same ideas, same everything?

Re “Workers in the Catskills Can’t Find Places to Live” (Real Estate, Aug. 21):
The struggle to find affordable (and available!) housing in the Hudson Valley is a problem for white-collar workers too. It’s really tough, for instance, for incoming assistant professors at SUNY New Paltz to afford housing on their salaries, which start at around $60,000. That affects whom the college can recruit and retain. In that way, the lack of affordable housing threatens one of the county’s anchor institutions — one that plays an important role in the region’s economy, character and community.

Re “In Ukraine War, a Nuclear Plant Is Held Hostage” (front page, Aug. 24):
By invading a sovereign nation and then using its most volatile asset as a defensive bulwark, Russia is revealing yet again why we need to think very carefully before embracing nuclear power as part of a global arsenal to combat climate change.
The Chernobyl disaster demonstrated nearly 40 years ago that, even in peaceful times, poorly designed and badly managed nuclear power can go tragically awry. Other nuclear accidents and near misses in the U.S. and abroad should have given us ample cause to sideline nuclear as a pathway to clean energy.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But Russia this time is not just mismanaging the Zaporizhzhia power plant; it is intentionally placing this giant facility — the largest in Europe — at the center of an existential battle over Ukraine sovereignty. Its nuclear brinkmanship reminds us that this technology, by its very existence, can be a powerful wartime weapon.
We have long been concerned that nuclear plants could be targets for terrorism — a concern that was heightened when we learned that Al Qaeda included U.S. nuclear plants as potential targets for terrorism. Russia’s actions bring a cynical new twist to nuclear power’s vulnerability in an unstable world.

Re “Democrat Pat Ryan Wins in House Race That Turned on Abortion” (nytimes.com, Aug. 24):
The victory by the Democratic candidate, Pat Ryan, over Mark Molinaro, a Republican, in the Hudson Valley’s 19th Congressional District race was more than just a referendum on the political power of abortion rights. As Mr. Ryan said on Twitter after he was declared the winner, freedom and choice were on the ballot.
Although Americans hold wildly differing views on policy, the economy and the role of government itself, the overwhelming majority are deeply committed to basic fundamentals of individual liberty and choice. Mr. Ryan’s victory signals that voters are deeply troubled by the G.O.P.’s flagrant embrace of a society where state governments not only prohibit women from making choices about their bodies, but also criminalize those who violate their edicts.

Re “Daniel Goldman, Ex-Trump Prosecutor, Tops Crowded Field in N.Y. Primary” (nytimes.com, Aug. 24):
I live in the newly configured 10th Congressional District in New York, and after working the polls I feel deeply dispirited. For 15 hours, poll workers served a dribble of voters in this supposedly politically engaged community.
Dan Goldman, who won a plurality — 16,686 votes, or 26 percent of the votes, versus 24 percent for his nearest rival, Yuh-Line Niou (as of this writing) — will likely become our representative in November in this heavily Democratic district.
Ms. Niou and Mondaire Jones, who came in third, together earned 27,157 votes, or 41.9 percent of the votes. The low voter turnout that I believe led to Mr. Goldman’s victory reflects that voters don’t care enough to fill out an absentee ballot before leaving for vacation. Maybe folks thought: It’s only the primary. But given the demographics, our next congressman will likely have been chosen by only 3.5 percent of the 474,320 registered voters in the district.
Yes, passivity is a choice. Blame summer, blame the courts, blame ourselves. There were real differences between the candidates — in experience, focus, ethnicity. But, hey, we’re playing pickleball.

Rating Jackson Hole’s crystal ball
Jay Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, gets a half-hour slot (10 a.m. Eastern) this morning to deliver his annual address at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. On the agenda: an update on the economic outlook, the inflation picture and the path ahead for interest rates.
A recap: When Powell spoke at the most recent rates-setting meeting in July, investors detected a dovish tone, and equities rallied. This morning’s speech will get special scrutiny as investors grasp for any hint at what might come next for the Fed, which has been raising rates rapidly in its campaign to tamp down the fastest rate of inflation in 40 years, writes The Times’s Jeanna Smialek.
After yesterday’s rally, U.S. equities futures are in the red this morning.
Over the years the Jackson Hole conference has been the source of some prescient calls about the economy, but also some pretty big swings and misses. Here’s a selection of the most memorable predictions that have come out of the conference, and how close they came to ringing true.
When: 2005
The prediction: The I.M.F.’s Raghuram Rajan warned of a looming “catastrophic meltdown” in financial markets thanks to “housing prices that are at elevated levels around the globe. While the techniques and instruments to absorb fluctuations have improved, there is uncertainty about how they will perform in a serious downturn.”

What happened: Nailed it. Despite being dismissed at the time (Larry Summers called Rajan’s analysis “misguided”), his projection of a drop in housing prices, and that it would cascade into the markets was on point.
2009
The prediction: The Fed chair, Ben Bernanke, called an end to the recession but warned that job gains would be slow. The words: “Economic activity appears to be leveling out, both in the United States and abroad, and the prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good.”
What happened: Bernanke was correct on slow job gains, but he was too optimistic about a sustained rebound, which took a few years to develop.
2016
The prediction: The Fed chairman, Janet Yellen, who had incorrectly predicted that interest rates would rise that summer, doubled down on a call for an imminent hike. “I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,” she said.
What happened: Her timing was off. The Fed did raise interest rates, but not until December, which many saw as arriving too late to give Yellen full credit for her forecast.

2021
The prediction: Powell, in a speech that used the word “transitory” five times, said inflation was unlikely to stay much above 2 percent. “Businesses and consumers widely report upward pressure on prices and wages. Inflation at these levels is, of course, a cause for concern. But that concern is tempered by a number of factors that suggest that these elevated readings are likely to prove temporary.”
What happened: Way off. Instead of falling, inflation went on to nearly double to an annual rate of 9 percent in June, from just over 5 percent a year ago. It has since leveled off, but few think inflation will return to 2 percent any time soon.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Regulators accuse Starbucks of discriminating against unionized employees. A regional office of the National Labor Relations Board said that the coffee chain denied such workers wage and benefit increases that were given to nonunion counterparts. Starbucks denied wrongdoing.
Dollar stores’ fortunes climb as inflation rises. The deep-discount sector’s two biggest retailers, Dollar Tree and Dollar General, reported strong profits as consumers increasingly flocked to their stores. A growing number of them are from higher-income households.

Citigroup will shut its Russian consumer banking arm. The U.S. firm will close 15 branches and lay off or move 2,300 workers, after struggling to sell the operation. A major factor in the decision was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Moscow.
Paul Allen’s art collection could fetch over $1 billion at auction. Christie’s will sell more than 150 works owned by the Microsoft co-founder, who died in 2018, including masterpieces by Renoir and Roy Lichtenstein. The sale would be the largest in auction history, with proceeds going to philanthropy.

Musk’s rough day in court
Judge Kathaleen McCormick, who is presiding over Twitter’s lawsuit against Elon Musk, yesterday announced a trio of rulings that resoundingly favored Twitter. She twice sided with Twitter in keeping discovery confined to a tighter time window. And she is compelling Musk to provide more detail on the analysis he performed that he says helped justify his decision to walk away from the deal to buy the social network.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Perhaps just as worrisome for Musk was the language and tone in which she delivered the rulings, indicating impatience with his demands. At one point, Judge McCormick refused to order Twitter to make good on Musk’s most expansive data requests “because no one in their right mind has ever tried to undertake such an effort.”

Judge McCormick kept the focus on the period covered in the merger agreement, which goes back only to January 2021. She denied two requests from Musk’s team pushing for discovery to go back multiple years. In so doing, the judge rejected as “absurdly broad” their demand that Twitter retrieve from its data logs several years’ worth of evidence to explain how it arrived at the spam-to-active-users ratio the company disclosed in previous filings. Instead, Judge McCormick ordered Twitter to supply a much narrower sample of 9,000 accounts since January 2021.
She also ordered Musk’s data scientists to hand over their work. Before Musk walked away from the Twitter deal, he hired data scientists to analyze Twitter’s “firehose” of data that, he says, resulted in such alarming results that he wanted out. Twitter has asked Musk to turn over that analysis; Musk has declined, arguing that it is privileged. (Experts hired only for trial preparation typically have client-attorney privilege.) But McCormick said the scientists also acted as witnesses, since they were part of a process that would lead to Musk abandoning the deal. And given the importance of their role — and Twitter’s inability to get their analysis elsewhere — they should provide their work, she argues.
What about Mudge? Musk’s side dropped another filing yesterday bringing Judge McCormick’s attention to the recent whistle-blower claims from Twitter’s former security chief, Peiter Zatko — who goes by the nickname Mudge — alleging that the company misled the public about how it tracks and fights spam and hackers. On the question of whether that’s relevant to Musk’s defense, Judge McCormick gave little indication of her thinking in yesterday’s rulings. But we have more questions, like whether Twitter’s side will try to question Zatko on the timing of going public ahead of the big October showdown in Delaware. (Twitter has accused Zatko of “opportunistic timing.” Mudge has said he had no contact with Musk).
And, might Musk file a new, federal suit against Twitter, alleging securities fraud and trying to get out of the deal that way? “It’s a bit of a long shot,” Eric Talley, a professor of corporate law at Columbia Law School, told DealBook. “But it’s not a crazy thing, if you were kind of backed up against the wall and you don’t like your chances on the contract.”

S.E.C. tries again with another C.E.O. pay rule
Companies will have to cough up much more information about executive compensation after the S.E.C. yesterday approved a new rule that’s been more than a decade in the making.
Citing the 2008 global financial crisis and “the stark misalignment of incentives that led executives to take excessive, catastrophic risks,” Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga hailed the ruling as a victory for shareholders. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was passed in response to the great financial meltdown and subsequent bank bailouts, directed the S.E.C. to make pay transparent. A 2015 proposal tried to do just that, but was never adopted. He hopes the new rule on executive pay will help “reduce the likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts.”
Executive pay must now be linked to specific performance goals. Companies will have to disclose and explain how their executives’ compensation relates to total shareholder return and other benchmarks. They will also have to show how their company’s pay data stacks up against peers.
Companies have flexibility in reporting this pay information — and that may be problematic, said Michael Dambra, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Management. Any performance measure can be finessed, he said, and businesses could choose comparisons that put them in the most favorable light, defeating the S.E.C.’s larger transparency objectives. Dambra’s own work on the effect of pay disclosures has shown that more reporting isn’t always illuminating.
Don’t expect much to change. A study by Dambra and his colleagues published last month found that a 2015 pay ratio rule adopted by the S.E.C., which required companies to report C.E.O. pay compared with the median compensation of their employees, did not lead to much, if any, pay reform. But he holds out hope for this latest rule. Because it requires firms to more explicitly articulate pay justifications, also in terms of shareholder returns, it could be more effective, Dambra said.

60: As in, the markets have assigned 60 percent odds that the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates by 75 basis points at next month’s board of governors meeting. For those keeping score: a 75-basis-point increase is considered hawkish, and could spook stock markets. Meanwhile, a 50-basis-points raise, which would be preferred by a majority of investors, is now looking less likely.
80: That’s the percentage increase in energy prices that most British households will pay this fall, after Britain’s energy regulator raised the cap on what typical customers will pay for electricity and gas in a year. That “cap” will be increased to 3,549 pounds ($4,200) in October. Industry forecasts predict that the cap will rise yet again to £6,600 a year by the spring.

2022-08-28,"Colleen McCreary recently gave managers at Credit Karma a message that could seem more apt for rising sixth graders than personal finance executives.
“Back to school is coming,” Ms. McCreary, the company’s chief people officer, recalled telling managers. “We’re getting excited about all of these returning-in-the-fall type activities.”
The company has been trying to get employees back to the office regularly for more than a year. First, the vaccine rollout gave executives hope that the office would be full again. Then there was “Wine Down Wednesday” in the company’s Charlotte, N.C., location, and kombucha by the firepit in the Oakland, Calif., building. Now Credit Karma’s leaders are relying on a different incentive: Labor Day. The latest corporate magical thinking is that September will herald the grand refilling of cubicles around the country.
Each pandemic fall has brought with it employers’ hopes of a broad-scale return to the office. Last year’s plans were derailed by the Delta variant. But this time, business leaders are adamant that they won’t change course. Seriously.

“I don’t like to take attendance or babysit, but managers should know where their people are,” Ms. McCreary said, adding that since February employees have been asked to come in at least a few days a week, though the number is not specified and different teams set their own guidelines‌.

It’s been more than two years since the rules of the working world snapped. On all sides of the debate over returning to the office, the stakes feel high as ever. More than one-third of U.S. workers who can do their jobs from home want to stay permanently remote, according to recent data from Gallup. Meanwhile, executives realize that if they don’t persuade their employees to come back now, with pandemic restrictions eased in most areas, the new norms of flexible work will be hard to unstick. So, some sense a standoff coming. Bosses say the office deadlines are real; workers are testing just how much they mean that.
“Many leaders have had decades of experience having all the answers,” said Sheela Subramanian, vice president of Future Forum, a Slack-backed research consortium. “That’s why you’re seeing a lot of these top down mandates of ‘you will do this,’ and the inevitable resistance to that.”
“I have seen an increased resolve among executives to figure out what’s next,” she added.
It’s either the end of an era of mute button fails, hybrid hiccups and making it up as we go along — or the beginning of outright rebellion.

“I don’t think there will be a big grand return to office,” said Christine Ratcliff, who works in online education and lives in Littleton, Colo. “It seems like a trickle.”
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
Ms. Ratcliff switched jobs last year and applied only for roles that would let her stay fully remote. She considers herself a night owl and bristles at the thought of a position requiring her to be alert early in the day. She feels comfortable at the desk in her one-bedroom apartment, seated under a whiteboard on which she has scrawled affirmations like “routine, not schedule.”
“I could see one company being like, ‘OK, today is the day we’re doing it, if we lose people we lose people,’” Ms. Ratcliff continued. “But in the culture as a whole it’s probably going to be a constant struggle.”
Some major companies brought workers back to the office in recent months, as the winter’s Omicron wave ebbed, including American Express, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs. But during the summer, workers took long-delayed vacations or worked from home more often, making offices feel ghostly quiet. Earlier this year, office attendance on Fridays was at 30 percent, far lower than it was on Wednesdays at 46 percent, according to data from Kastle.

People were working remotely about 35 percent of the time this spring, according to a national survey from Stanford and other institutions. That is more than employers had expected. The same survey found that companies had planned for their employees to be remote just 30 percent of the time by 2022.
In general, it’s been a period of surprises for business leaders — who are sometimes realizing they don’t know where their employees are working, even if they know it isn’t the office.
“One organization I spoke to had employees update their mailing address because they were sending out sweatshirts,” said Steve Black, chief strategy officer at the H.R. technology company Topia. “They found people in random places around the globe.”
“There’s been a little bit of ostrich burying its head in the sand, a bit of ‘we’re trying to keep people safe and do our best,’” he added. “We’re starting to see folks formalize their policies.”

A number of companies, including Apple, Capital One, Comcast and The New York Times Company, are setting fresh guidelines around returning to the office for September.
For many workers, a fresh push from bosses means new forms of pushback. Chris Campbell, who manages a team at an advertising agency in Minneapolis, has been required to go into the office one day a week since May. This summer, executives at his agency have been discussing ramping up the return to office to two days a week, while Mr. Campbell keeps emphasizing how much he has gained from the freedoms of remote work.
“You’re able to be so much more present with your child and your partner,” he said. “And your dog.” (His is named Frida, a German wirehaired pointer with bushy brows.)
Mr. Campbell has assured his own direct reports they shouldn’t feel pressured to commute in, and gave two permission to leave Minneapolis and go permanently remote. “People are going to resist it pretty heavily,” he said broadly of return to office plans. “But it’s a pretty uphill battle.”
At Credit Karma, which has more than 1,500 employees, company leaders have persistently faced resistance on returning to the office. During several full-staff video meetings in 2020, Ms. McCreary recalled, leaders spent nearly all their time fielding questions about remote work. Much of the opposition she heard came from workers who said they were productive at home, found it easier to have a personal life with remote work and saw some competitors take the leap to permanent flexibility. The company terminated two employees for working in locations where the business isn’t authorized to operate.

“It’s always, ‘Google is doing XYZ,’ or ‘Facebook is doing XYZ,’ or ‘Small start-up down the street is doing XYZ,’ why can’t we?” Ms. McCreary said. “We’re very clear this is the choice we’ve made, and if people want to make another choice there are lots of opportunities for people from Credit Karma to go work somewhere else.”

Some Credit Karma employees have embraced the company’s approach on returning to the office, which sets the expectation that they work in person but allows them to pick which days. Patrick Kennedy, 28, a growth technology manager, joined the firm in February after leaving his previous job at a cable company because he had to work in person on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. He said he often couldn’t get an exemption to stay home when last-minute child care obligations arose, while at Credit Karma he has more flexibility.
Mr. Kennedy now goes into the office frequently because he feels energized by his morning routine of bopping desk to desk, trash-talking his office Ping-Pong opponents and finding colleagues who share his “Stranger Things” obsession.
“I’ll get someone on my team, we’ll stop and see Scotty who hired me, we’ll take the elevator to the eighth floor to say hi, chitchat,” Mr. Kennedy said. “I’m eager to get to work just because when something happens, I have to inform them of my own personal life gossip.”

At many companies, including Credit Karma, leaders have felt a growing sense of urgency to make their work arrangements more concrete, given the logistical bumps in that hazy middle ground between fully remote and fully in-person work. A recent survey of human resources professionals showed that 39 percent had found an employee working in a location where their business didn’t have tax approval to operate.

Comcast and NBCUniversal are shifting into a newly detailed return-to-office plan in September, in which U.S. office-based employees are asked to be in person on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Previously, management asked employees to be in the office several days a week but didn’t specify which days, and some were finding it challenging to see their teammates.
At Apple, some employees recently circulated a petition demanding the option to keep working remotely after Labor Day: “This uniform mandate from senior leadership does not consider the unique demands of each job role nor the diversity of individuals,” members of the group Apple Together wrote.
Apple declined to comment on the petition.
Beyond the white-collar work force, which is centered in larger cities where people have longer commutes, a lot of people are working in person. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that last month just 7 percent of Americans worked from home at some point because of Covid. Researchers point out, though, that this figure underestimates the extent of remote work. The survey asks people whether they are working from home because of Covid. But more and more people are working from home not because of Covid, but because of the way the pandemic reshaped the norms of work.

Zoe Sands, who works at a financial services firm in Denver doing internal audits, learned that management wanted her to start coming in once a week starting in May. Then she heard the company is hoping to build up to three days a week by later this year. She has decided that she would try to negotiate with her manager if she is asked to come in more than two days.
Ms. Sands feels most at ease when she can wake up at 7:15 a.m., drink a Yerba Mate and immediately start answering emails without devoting time to doing her hair and makeup. Going into the office means spending part of her morning rooting through her closet looking for an outfit that doesn’t make her feel self-conscious.
“One day I was really stressed out because I couldn’t find anything to wear,” she said. “I was like, that’s a really dumb way to call in and not go to the office, because I’m having a wardrobe malfunction.”
But the strain of trying to remake lives and routines is far from trivial. In conversations with more than three dozen people, it is clear that many can’t picture squeezing themselves back into office life with all its constraints, from the discomfort of blazers to the sting of a hallway slight. Others are increasingly desperate to return to the version of working life that existed before the pandemic and can’t imagine entirely letting go of their in-person relationships.

As summer fades, people are increasing attempts to articulate those workplace needs. Mr. Campbell, for example, said he has been raising concerns about returning to the office with his managers, emphasizing the prospect of the company losing out on talent because its competitors are embracing more flexibility.
Mr. Campbell has listened to his colleagues who ask: With the business winning awards and growing its client pool, what’s the point in returning to old ways of working? While he has made his own reservations clear, Mr. Campbell worries that company leaders have made up their minds.
“There’s some sort of cultural linkage to August and September being the time people want to go back,” he added. “It’s tied to that, ‘We’ll get through summer and then we have real work to do.’”
With two years of return-to-office wrangling under their belts, some managers are feeling more confident about spelling out their expectations, both to their employees and to job applicants.
“I’ve had conversations with candidates where they’re very much like ‘I would prefer to work remote.’ Then I have people at the opposite end of the spectrum,” said Ms. Dukes, 40, the director of engineering at Credit Karma.
“Sometimes there are situations where we’re not going to align with a candidate,” she added. “That happens.”"

Looking beyond China
This month, Apple is expected to release the iPhone 14. Beyond rumors, little is known about what the crew from Cupertino, Calif., has planned for the company’s newest version of its nearly ubiquitous smartphone.
But there is one major change that most consumers will probably fail to notice: A small but growing number of the latest iPhones will be manufactured outside China, report The Times’s Daisuke Wakabayashi and Tripp Mickle. That’s a big change for Apple, and it is not alone.
After years of growing their Chinese operations, U.S. tech firms are starting to relocate production. The moves have been small so far. China is the world’s most dominant consumer electronic manufacturer, but there are growing signs of a great remapping of the global supply chain. Yesterday, China said that factory activity contracted in August.
Geopolitical tensions have driven the exit. Some companies began looking for options outside China during Donald Trump’s presidency, when tit-for-tat tariffs created risks of supply disruptions. Coronavirus-related shutdowns — Chengdu is the latest — raised further concerns. And China’s saber-rattling after Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s August visit to Taiwan has hastened the pace of American companies looking to add manufacturing capacity outside China.

Despite talk of reshoring, though, very few of the jobs appear headed for the U.S.
Apple moved some production of AirPods to Vietnam in 2020, where it also makes watches and iPads. More iPhone production will be done there as well.
Google will shift a portion of its latest Pixel phone manufacturing to Vietnam from China.
Microsoft’s Xbox and Amazon’s Fire TV devices, both of which used to be exclusively made in China, now ship from Vietnam and India, respectively.
The Biden administration has placed new restrictions on the chips makers Nvidia and AMD selling to China and Russia.
It will be hard for many companies to leave China completely. Google, for instance, is considering a foldable phone that will most likely need to be made in China because it requires advanced materials. More generally, over two decades, the tech industry has built up a low cost and formidable supply chain in China (at least before the pandemic). “We have a long way to go to have the whole supply chain diversified outside of China,” said Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group who focuses on the tech supply chain.
Vietnam appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the China exodus. Real estate brokers say they are busy showing properties to multinationals, even as the price of industrial land there has increased in the past few years. Foxconn, Apple’s largest contract manufacturer, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars expanding in Vietnam.
“The empire of manufacturing in China is being shaken,” said Lior Susan, the founder of Eclipse Venture Capital, which invests in hardware and manufacturing start-ups. “More and more capital is going to pull manufacturing out of China and find an alternative.”

Abortion rights loom larger in investment decisions
In recent years, impact investment funds have increasingly emerged to bet on start-ups advancing reproductive health and innovation. After the Supreme Court decision in June to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion, the retail investment community turned its attention to reproductive health care.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Almost immediately after the court’s decision, the investing app Alinea, which is geared toward young adults, saw a new investment focus on companies that support reproductive health, said Alinea’s founders, Eve Halimi and Anam Lakhani. “When the news came out, one of the community members created a pro-abortion-rights playlist” — as in, a basket of stocks — “with companies that were supporting the cause,” Halimi told DealBook. “We saw a rush of activity.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Reproductive health as a criteria. That first user-created playlist included companies that were taking a public stand to support abortion access, echoing public demand for businesses to weigh in on the issue.
Later, users asked for an updated version of the playlist, and the founders adopted that same inclusive standard. It now includes about 50 firms — including Levi’s, Apple, Pfizer and Tesla — that have taken a stand against the overturning of Roe v. Wade, or those that help pay for employees’ access to abortion services, or both.
Data shared with DealBook shows reproductive rights looming large in investment decisions. But location and gender matter. One month after the decision, Alinea had about 10,000 female users. Of those:
About 11 percent are in Texas, where abortion access was threatened, and slightly more than half are now investing in anti-abortion companies.
About 25 percent are in New York City, where reproductive rights remain robust, and only about 40 percent of them are investing in anti-abortion companies.
More than 30 percent of new app users now cite the change in reproductive rights as a reason for their interest in both investing and financial independence.
No male users have invested in playlists that are made up of companies supporting abortion rights.
Reproductive rights at the corporate level are the “newest E.S.G. frontier,” according to Confluence Philanthropy, a network of investment managers, shareholder activists and others that convened a panel discussion on the matter in June. Expect a flurry of proxy proposals as activists plan to push deeper into the corporate arena. Previous efforts have failed, but E.S.G. experts are certainly telling companies to start preparing.
“We think it’s poised to be a game changer. It’s really going to open the floodgates for proxy fights.”

McDonald’s speaks out against California fast-food bill
Yesterday, the president of McDonald’s U.S.A., Joe Erlinger, came out in full force against a new California bill that he says “should raise alarm bells across the country.” The measure, A.B. 257, could transform the way the service sector is regulated.
The bill, which the California Senate passed on Monday and which awaits Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature, would create a state council to establish minimum pay and safety conditions. Supporters say it will protect fast-food workers from pay theft, discrimination and unsafe work environments.

Erlinger says the bill goes too far. His open letter is a sign of just how high the stakes are for McDonald’s and the restaurant industry, which fears similar legislation being adopted elsewhere.
“This is a clear example of picking ‘winners and’ losers,” said Erlinger, who called the legislation “the outcome of backroom politicking.” The bill excludes independent operators with fewer than 100 locations. But it applies to chains that are part of a larger company, like McDonald’s. The bill also provides an exemption for restaurants that produce bread “as a stand-alone menu item,” meaning it probably won’t extend to chains like Panera.
Erlinger isn’t against reform. He said that he wanted to see progress on worker pay and protections, and that new measures should be applied equally across the industry. “Shouldn’t all restaurant workers benefit?,” he asked.
Erlinger also worries about the inflationary effect of the bill. McDonald’s, for its part, raised the minimum wage at restaurants it owns last year by 10 percent to reach an average of $15 an hour by 2024. But its franchisees are free to set pay, and they have not all moved in tandem. Some franchisees “still focus too much on the cost side, and don’t see investment in people as a way actually to grow their cash flow over time,” the McDonald’s C.E.O. Chris Kempczinski told The Times last year.
A crypto mogul stares down the tax man
Michael Saylor became a hero to the cryptocurrency faithful in recent years for directing MicroStrategy, the software company he co-founded, to spend roughly $4 billion to buy Bitcoin. That move has looked disastrous as the price of Bitcoin has dropped below $20,000. Saylor and MicroStrategy face a new problem: tax charges.

Saylor is accused of evading $25 million in taxes owed to the District of Columbia, according to a lawsuit by Karl Racine, the district’s attorney general. Though Saylor has claimed to live in Virginia or Florida — states with little or no personal income taxes — he has actually lived in several properties around Washington, Racine claims. (As proof, the district points to Facebook posts by Saylor that reference a home in Washington.)
MicroStrategy is also named as a defendant. In his complaint, Racine accused the company of knowing that Saylor was evading D.C. taxes and of working with him to help hide that fact.
It’s a potentially big problem for Saylor and MicroStrategy, with Racine seeking what could amount to more than $100 million in unpaid taxes and penalties. That’s on top of a plunge in the value of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings amid the broader decline in the crypto market. The company’s shares have nearly halved over the past 12 months; Saylor recently stepped down as C.E.O.

A corporate turnaround artist’s new gig
Yesterday, DealBook broke the news that Starbucks had chosen Laxman Narasimhan as its next chief executive, a hire that puts the 55-year-old in line to run the world’s largest coffee chain and a global corporate giant. With unionization drives, rising inflation and other issues to contend with, that’s a venti-size job for anyone — but who, exactly, is Narasimhan?
He’s a veteran of American and British companies. Born in Pune, India, Narasimhan studied engineering and moved to the U.S. to attend the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. He then joined McKinsey & Company, becoming a senior partner, before shifting in 2012 to PepsiCo, where he oversaw operations in regions including Latin America and Europe. In 2019, he was hired to lead Reckitt Benckiser, the British conglomerate that makes Lysol disinfectant and Durex condoms.
Narasimhan was tasked with cleaning up Reckitt, which had struggled with slowing sales and an ill-fated $16.6 billion takeover of the infant products maker Mead Johnson. He quickly moved to cut costs while investing in Reckitt’s supply chains and product research. He also sold underperforming divisions, and scrapped a potential breakup of the company.
Investors and analysts praised his turnaround work. “The business is now on a fundamentally firmer footing,” Jeremy Fialko, an analyst at HSBC, wrote in a research note yesterday. Reckitt has delivered four consecutive quarters of above-expectations organic sales growth, and in July, it raised its revenue outlook for this year. (In a sign of his perceived worth, Reckitt’s shares fell over 5 percent yesterday after the company disclosed he was leaving.)
Starbucks was drawn to his broad experience across industries and international borders, as well as his knowledge of technology and supply chains. “He’s a true operator and has the DNA of an entrepreneur,” Howard Schultz, the company’s longtime leader and interim C.E.O., told DealBook.
Narasimhan will gradually take the reins at Starbucks: He’ll join the coffee chain in October as “incoming C.E.O.,” but he won’t formally lead until April. During that transition, Schultz said, Narasimhan will get “immersed” in Starbucks’s culture by traveling to stores worldwide and even working behind the counter at some locations.
That slow-roll approach appears to fit with how he took on the Reckitt job: On a McKinsey podcast in 2020, Narasimhan said of starting his new role, “I recognized I needed to be humble about it and take some time to set an agenda.”

Gas prices fall as a key Russian pipeline prepares to restart. Natural gas appears ready to flow again through Nord Stream 1 tomorrow, after Russia shut it down for what it said was maintenance. But European leaders said they were worried about Moscow turning off gas flows in the winter.
Lukoil’s chairman dies after falling from a hospital window. Exactly how Ravil Maganov, who oversaw Russia’s second-largest oil giant, died is unclear: The state-owned Tass news agency said it was a suicide, while associates interviewed by Reuters said that was unlikely. Other Russian executives tied to the energy industry have died under suspicious circumstances since the Ukraine invasion.

The F.T.C. loses on its home turf
The F.T.C. yesterday lost its bid in the agency’s administrative court to block the takeover of Grail, a maker of a test for early-stage cancer detection, by Illumina, a gene-sequencing company, for $8 billion. Grail formed as a separate company in 2016 inside Illumina and was later spun off. Last year, Illumina closed the deal while antitrust regulators in Europe and the U.S. were still scrutinizing it.
The ruling comes after an administrative law trial last year and  members of Congress told President Biden, health regulators and the F.T.C. that resistance to the deal was delaying Americans’ access to potentially lifesaving technology.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Vertical mergers are rarely blocked. Illumina and Grail do not compete with each other directly, but the F.T.C. last year moved to stop the deal, claiming the acquisition “would substantially lessen competition in the U.S. multi-cancer early detection” because “Illumina is a near monopolist in next-generation DNA sequencing” and Grail’s competitors rely on Illumina technology. The merger would give Illumina incentive to thwart their efforts, the agency argued. But Illumina countered that the F.T.C. was incorrectly characterizing the test market and was pitting Grail against other test manufacturers with very different products.
What does all of this mean for antitrust? The opinion is not yet public, but a lawyer who reviewed it told DealBook that it was highly specific to the facts in this case and may not hurt the Biden administration’s wider campaign to crack down on corporate consolidation. The F.T.C.’s Bureau of Competition could also appeal the administrative law judge’s decision: Holly Vedova, the bureau’s director, said that it was “reviewing the opinion and evaluating our options.”

Europe is also expanding its review of mergers. In July, the E.U.’s General Court ruled that the bloc’s antitrust commission had the authority to examine the deal even if the market concentration at issue “did not have a European dimension” because it was referred for review by a member state. It was the first decision on new standards adopted last year, potentially opening an era of more aggressive review by the bloc. Illumina is appealing the decision. Whether the new U.S. ruling could influence consideration in Europe remains to be seen, but the American and European authorities have cooperated on this case and may keep playing off each other.
Biden faces a legal fight over student loans
President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan, which was announced last week, would cancel as much as $20,000 in debt per borrower for millions of Americans. The initiative has excited liberal Democrats, divided moderate Democrats and has been demonized as irresponsible by Republicans.

It might not happen. In the past week, financial services trade groups, private lenders, scholars and think tank experts have been trying to determine if the White House initiative is legally sound, reports The Times’s Alan Rappeport. Loan servicers are among those who would sue, legal experts say, on grounds that they could lose revenue from the executive action. Some attorneys general have hinted they are planning a legal challenge.
The administration says it’s on “very strong legal ground.” The pandemic, the administration said, gives it the power to invoke a 2003 law that allows the education secretary to “alleviate hardship” because of a national emergency.
Others say the administration’s defense is somewhere between “sloppy” and “dubious.” Tying the loan forgiveness now to the pandemic is a stretch, they say. “Blanket student loan forgiveness is undoubtedly an act of economic and political significance, and the likelihood it is upheld within the president’s authority is dubious,” said Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president for social policy, education and politics at the Third Way, a center-left policy think tank.

If only there had been an edit button sooner …
Twitter users, many of you are about to get your wish: an edit button. It won’t necessarily mean the end of fat-finger flubs, unfortunate typos, customer-service spats gone wrong or covfefe-size head-scratchers, but it could save politicians, executives and the rest of us from serious embarrassment.
The social network said yesterday that it had started testing the correction ability internally, with the aim of gradually offering it to other users “in the coming weeks.”
Here’s how it works. Users will see a button to edit a tweet, but you’ve got to be quick on the draw: The function expires 30 minutes after the tweet is sent. “Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more,” Twitter explained in a blog post. As always, you could simply delete a regrettable missive and hope nobody caught it, much less recorded it for posterity.
Inspired by the big news, we thought it timely to share some memorable gaffes and #fails. Here are three of our favorites:
American Red Cross gets #slizzerd. In 2011, Twitter users puzzled over a late-night tweet from the nonprofit group’s account that someone named Ryan had fetched a couple of bottles of Dogfish Head beer. “When we drink we do it right #gettngslizzerd,” the tweet concluded. P.R. pros applauded what came next: The organization deleted “the rogue tweet” and then joked, “rest assured the Red Cross is sober and we’ve confiscated keys.” Impressed, Dogfish Head encouraged its followers to participate in Red Cross blood drives.

Kenneth Cole’s Arab Spring bombshell. During the pro-democracy uprising in Egypt in 2011, the fashion brand unwisely weighed in. “Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now available online,” read a tweet from its official account, linking to its online store. After an outcry, Kenneth Cole apologized, tweeting, “We weren’t intending to make light of a serious situation. We understand the sensitivity of this historic moment -KC.” (Cole himself drew criticism two years later for joking about the conflict in Syria.)
Affirm jumps the gun. In February, the online payments company tweeted that it had just completed “another great quarter” and shared highlights of its financial results. There was just one problem: Affirm wasn’t scheduled to report just yet. The company deleted the tweet, but the damage was done. Its stock sank.

Elon Musk earns a split decision in Delaware court
Some potential major cracks are beginning to appear in Elon Musk’s suit to undo his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, yesterday’s hearing in Delaware’s Court of Chancery revealed. But Musk has also scored a major victory.
Nearly two hours after DealBook published on Wednesday, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the case, ruled that Musk can amend his suit to include whistle-blower accusations from Peiter Zatko, a former Twitter security chief who claimed that the social network had misled the public about its security practices. However, she rejected Musk’s request for a delay of the trial, which will proceed on Oct. 17. Twitter shares surged 4 percent on the news.
Here are some of the highlights from the hearing on Tuesday:
Musk told his Morgan Stanley banker to slow the deal down less than two weeks after the purchase agreement was announced. On May 8, Musk texted Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to express concerns about the geopolitical environment that could weigh on the deal. “Let’s slow down just a few days. Putin’s speech tomorrow is really important,” said the text, which was read during the hearing and referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It won’t make sense to buy Twitter if we’re heading into World War 3.” On May 13, he tweeted that the deal was on hold. (A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.)
That revelation could put him in breach of contract, which requires the buyer to use his or her best efforts to close a deal. It could also undermine Musk’s complaint that Twitter was not providing information about bots he needed to close the deal. The text makes it seem as if Musk’s private concerns over the transaction had little to do with bots.

Musk discussed re-pricing the deal with Bob Steel, a partner at Perella Weinberg, according to text messages Twitter’s lawyers disclosed yesterday. They detailed an exchange in mid-June in which the two were contemplating using a “contingent value right arrangement” that would have adjusted the payout to Twitter shareholders depending on certain bot figures. (A spokeswoman for Perella Weinberg declined to comment.)
McCormick, at times, showed little patience for Musk’s legal team.
She told Musk’s team that its efforts to fully identify all of the people with whom he spoke to about the deal “bothered me a lot.” She added, “I ordered you to do the job,” and called his team’s response to her request about naming those parties “suboptimal.”
Musk’s lawyers argued that even if Musk had done full due diligence for the deal, the Twitter board would have hid the whistle-blowers’ accusations. McCormick replied: “We don’t know what would have happened in diligence because there wasn’t any due diligence, right?”

A test case for antitrust’s global reach
Illumina last week scored a big win over U.S. antitrust regulators in its battle to buy Grail, a maker of early cancer-detection tests, for $8 billion. But yesterday, the gene-sequencing company faced a major setback when the E.U.’s competition authority blocked the same transaction. The decision makes the deal a test case for a new era of stricter global scrutiny of M.&A.

This is the first application of new E.U. antitrust standards, which were adopted last year. They allow E.U. member states to request a merger review even if the companies involved aren’t concentrated in the eurozone market.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The move is a sharp reversal in Illumina’s fortunes from last week, when an F.T.C. administrative law judge ruled that the deal did not pose a threat to competition. The agency is appealing.

It’s a sign that antitrust is still a global matter, even if the companies argue that their deals aren’t. Illumina has said its deal posed no issues for the bloc: “Grail has no products or customers in Europe,” Francis deSouza, Illumina’s C.E.O., told DealBook. But antitrust experts say that may not matter, if the E.U.’s precedent holds. DeSouza said that could lead “any country” asserting jurisdiction over any business, regardless of whether it operates in a region.
Illumina is preparing for worst-case scenarios, including divesting Grail, which it formally acquired last year despite continuing antitrust reviews by the U.S. and the E.U. Still, the company plans to appeal both this E.U. ruling and the previous one that gave the European Commission jurisdiction in the matter. “We think everyone needs clarity,” deSouza said.
Green tech investing is hotter than ever
Just weeks ago, President Biden signed into law a landmark climate bill to spur investments in the green tech needed to produce clean energy. The bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, is the latest in a series of policy moves that has led to a recent surge in funding for battery factories, solar panel manufacturing and mining.
Investment in renewables will reach $1.2 trillion by 2035, analysts at Wood Mackenzie estimate — in part because the bill, which will invest $369 billion over 10 years in direct funding, loans and loan guarantees, has brought much-needed certainty to companies that political leaders are serious about steering the country away from fossil fuels, report The Times’s Jack Ewing and Ivan Penn.
Corporations like Toyota and Honda have announced that they are investing billions of dollars to build new factories for batteries for electric cars and hybrids. The mining company Piedmont Lithium said it would build a lithium processing plant in Tennessee as the U.S. looks to ease its dependence on Chinese refineries. First Solar, a big solar panel manufacturer, said it would spend $1.2 billion building a factory in the Southeast to meet growing demand.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But even with the bill delivering a large infusion of federal funding, reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be a challenge, analysts and industry representatives say. The new projects will take time to finish; Toyota’s factory, as well as Honda’s venture with LG, won’t start producing batteries until 2025. Procuring the raw materials for batteries is another challenge. So is location. Landowners, environmentalists and businesses have raised concerns about offshore wind farms near fisheries and about building power lines through farmland, which are needed to transmit solar energy.

What the iPhone 14 will say about Apple
At 10 a.m. Pacific today, Apple will unveil the iPhone 14. But Apple watchers say the newest iPhone is not the main event this year. Expectations for anything truly wowie are teensy-weensy. The 14 is likely to have a pro-size screen, even for the basic model. The camera will be slightly better.
But while the iPhone 14 might not be a big reveal, Apple’s C.E.O., Tim Cook, could still make news if he addresses the biggest issues facing the company — privacy, China and how much innovation is still left in the tech giant. Here’s what to listen for.
On privacy: Unlike its rivals Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook), Apple has long used its commitment to consumer privacy as a selling point. That stance could be under threat as the company seeks more revenue from online advertising, delivering ads on its websites, in Apple Maps or through apps. The Times’s Shira Ovide says it’s hard to do that and not suck up some, or a lot, of consumer data.
On China: Apple’s strong ties to Beijing are perhaps its biggest risk. Apple knows it. The company is making more of its products outside the country. But quitting China, as The Times’s Tripp Mickle reports, will not be easy. “The iPhone has gone from being a product that is designed in California and made in China to one that is a creation of both countries,” Mickle writes.
On innovation: Apple has always used lofty goals to elevate its marketing. And this year’s event, with the tagline “far out,” is no different. But Apple these days has been less about getting consumers to buy new devices, and more about getting users to do more things with their iPhones, like making payments or tracking health. If Cook and others talk about all of the cool new things that an iPhone can do — and less about what Apple might do — today’s event may hardly be the “far out” affair investors had hoped for.

2022-09-08,"WESTMINSTER, Calif. — Dozens of Vietnamese-speaking volunteers filled a community center on a recent Wednesday to phone bank for Representative Michelle Steel, Republican of California, a Korean American lawmaker whose campaign signs and fliers in Vietnamese and English lined the walls.
A few neighborhoods down, Jay Chen, a Democrat and Navy reservist of Taiwanese descent who is challenging Ms. Steel, passed out fliers outside of Zippost, a shipping business that residents often use to send packages to relatives in Vietnam. Mr. Chen, donning a Navy hat, walked around the plaza with a Vietnamese-speaking volunteer in tow helping residents register to vote.
Ms. Steel and Mr. Chen are vying to appeal to the Asian American voters who dominate the electorate in this slice of Orange County, making up a quarter of the voting population. Their race — one of only a few dozen competitive ones that could determine which party controls the House — is being watched closely for clues about what may move voters in this increasingly critical bloc.
“The Asian vote can really give enough votes for a candidate to win,” said Mary Anne Foo, the executive director of the nonprofit Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander Community Alliance, a nonpartisan resource center. “What’s significant now is the number of Asian Americans running for office. Having representation is exciting.”

Across the country, Asian American voters, who comprised 4 percent of the electorate in 2020, are the fastest-growing population of eligible voters. The Asian American Voter Survey found in July that nearly half of Asian Americans identified as Democrats, about a third as independents and about a fifth as Republicans. About two-thirds voted for Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump, surveys show.
However, an analysis by The New York Times found that immigrant communities shifted to the right as they had a surge in voters in 2020. The Asian American Voter Survey found that older Asian voters tended to identify as independent or Republican at higher rates than those in younger generations. Vietnamese Americans, who make up a large proportion of Asian residents in Orange County, also leaned more to the right.

Both candidates in the race have made tackling inflation the centerpiece of their campaigns, and both have also focused on safety amid an increase in reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans — themes that are top of mind for many Asian voters, according to analysts.
Karthick Ramakrishnan, the founder of AAPI Data, which helps conduct the annual Asian American Voter Survey, said the economy and crime were top issues for respondents, which could give an advantage to Republicans. But health care has also been a major issue, he said, which could boost Democrats, who recently pushed through Congress sweeping climate, health and tax legislation that would lower prescription drug costs and subsidize health insurance, among other benefits.

“The ethnicity of the candidate is a bit of a wash in terms of how much it will make a difference here, so it’ll be important to see the kind of appeals each of these candidates make,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said.
Still, race has hung heavily over the contest, sometimes in ugly ways.
Ms. Steel, who was born in South Korea and raised in Japan, has accused Mr. Chen of mocking her accent; he said at a campaign event in April that people need “an interpreter to figure out exactly what she’s saying.” Mr. Chen said in an interview that his comments were misconstrued and that he meant he did not understand her policies.
In the campaign feud, he has accused Ms. Steel of “red-baiting” by painting him as sympathetic to China’s authoritarian government. An accusation of communist sympathies may be particularly resonant to the county’s many refugees who still have bitter memories of fleeing a communist regime.
Mr. Chen, the Harvard-educated son of immigrants who is a member of the board of trustees of Mt. San Antonio Community College and owns a local real estate business, said he has tried to appeal to right-leaning voters with his military experience. He served stints in the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula with the Seventh Fleet, which helped evacuate refugees after the Vietnam War.

She narrowly defeated Representative Harley Rouda, a Democrat, in 2020 in a district along the California Coast that leaned Republican, becoming one of the first three Korean American women to serve in Congress. But she was displaced by redistricting and opted to run in a new district that tilts slightly toward Democrats.
Lance Trover, the communications director for Ms. Steel’s campaign, said in a statement that she was focused on standing up to China and lowering taxes.
“Michelle is the campaign’s greatest asset because AAPI voters know and trust her,” Mr. Trover said in the statement, using the abbreviation for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Ms. Steel declined to be interviewed.
Orange County was once described by President Ronald Reagan as a place “where the good Republicans go before they die.” Its partisan bent has since shifted as a younger, more diverse population has moved from the Los Angeles metropolitan area seeking more affordable living. Now, Democrats outnumber Republicans in voter registration, and there is a sizable no-party preference voter bloc, according to the latest statistics from the county voter registrar.

The pendulum swung for the first time in 2018, when Democrats swept into the House majority by flipping four seats in the area, giving Democrats control of all seven congressional seats in the county. It swung in the other direction in 2020, when Republicans reclaimed two seats in Orange County.
But the shifts reshaping the area are lasting, and they reflect similar ones underway in suburban enclaves across the country, as immigrant communities relocate out of cities, said Christine Chen, the executive director of Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, which helps conduct the Asian American Voter Survey.

The same trend is underway in Virginia, a state that has leaned toward Democrats in recent years, and in Georgia, she said. Mr. Ramakrishnan added that districts in New Jersey and the suburbs of Houston and Dallas are experiencing a similar dynamic.
“The Asian American population, in all of those instances, has increased so much that, really, elected officials have no choice but to make sure they engage and develop a relationship with the Asian American voters, because they’re coming out to vote,” said Ms. Chen, who is not related to the Democratic candidate challenging Ms. Steel.

Asian Americans make up over a fifth of residents of Orange County, which is known for having the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam, many of whom sought refuge in the region after the Vietnam War.
The district encompasses Little Saigon, a stretch of Vietnamese-owned homes and businesses in the city of Westminster, which looks like most aging suburbs in Southern California: palm trees, stucco single-family homes and sun-bleached signs. Vietnamese and occasionally Korean and Chinese characters are predominantly featured on storefronts, and the political signage clogging up street corners feature mainly candidates with Asian surnames. Both campaigns and local organizations have been investing heavily on advertisements in Vietnamese.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced in July that it planned to make a seven-figure investment to reach Asian voters in California, and the Republican National Committee has opened several Asian Pacific American community centers across the county, a multimillion-dollar investment aiming to recruit volunteers for voter outreach to support Republican candidates, with one of the first in Little Saigon.
John Le, 57, a Vietnamese American Microsoft engineer from Lake Forest who described himself as a traditional Republican, said that, partisan politics aside, he was proud to be in a district with two Asian American candidates. He said he planned to vote for Ms. Steel.
“It’s the American dream,” Mr. Le said. “We should be proud of these people who are giving back to the community. I will look at who will represent me the most.”"

1. Russia acknowledged the loss of large swaths of northeast Ukraine.
The Ukrainian military is claiming to have retaken 20 towns and villages over the last day, in addition to 200 square miles in the country’s south and nearly all of the northern Kharkiv region. One military expert told The Times that the advance showed the effective collapse of one of four Russian regional commands in Ukraine.
Russia still holds vast chunks of eastern and southern Ukraine, but the stunning land capture raises questions over whether Russia’s once-daunting military can hold the territory it still controls. Russian officials who described the retreat as a planned move to “regroup” face hard questions, especially with a growing backlash from pro-war voices at home.
Ukraine’s sudden battlefield success provides evidence to the West that its military aid is helping. Analysts say the recent developments will probably increase the pressure on allies to supply more sophisticated, heavier weapons.

2. Child poverty in the U.S. has fallen by 59 percent since 1993. An expanded government safety net played a critical role.
In every state across America, children have become much less poor over the last 30 years. Child poverty has fallen by about the same degree among children who are white, Black, Hispanic and Asian. Lower unemployment and increased labor force participation played roles, but a new analysis showed that government aid was the most dominant factor.
My colleague Jason DeParle went to Huntington, W.Va. — a state, once the epitome of childhood deprivation, where child poverty dropped about 75 percent since 1993 — to examine the impact of the expanded safety net there. He found that children now have financial protection that their parents often lacked.

5. New York is set to vote on new rules for holding private schools to academic standards.
A Times investigation found that Hasidic boys’ schools in particular are systemically denying some 50,000 children an adequate education, an apparent violation of state law, while receiving more than $1 billion in public funding over the past four years. Some use corporal punishment to keep children in line.
State officials met today to discuss proposed regulations that would hold private schools to minimum academic standards. The proposals, which are expected to pass this week, would likely most affect Hasidic Jewish schools in New York City.

Employers around the U.S. have been desperate to hire workers as the country has rebounded from the depths of the pandemic. But the share of people who are either working or actively looking for a job still hasn’t quite recovered.
Covid’s death toll has played a role, and legal immigration has slowed down. People at retirement age dropped out at disproportionate rates and haven’t returned. More puzzlingly, men in their prime working years have retreated from the work force, while women have bounced back.

8. HBO and Netflix are expected to win big at tonight’s Emmys.
Hosted by Kenan Thompson, the “Saturday Night Live” veteran, this year’s Emmys will look more like its prepandemic past than either of its last two iterations. Beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern, viewers can watch the ceremony on NBC or the streaming service Peacock.
With submissions for drama, comedy and limited categories all up significantly, this may be the most competitive year at the Emmys to date. Still, the top two most-decorated networks will almost certainly be, as usual, HBO and Netflix — with “Succession” as the drama favorite.

10. And finally, an arms race between humans and cockatoos.
Sulfur-crested cockatoos are notorious in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia, as relentless trash-bin bandits. They are known to quickly learn how to open the lids of garbage containers in search of bread and other food and learn new methods from each other in a type of cultural transmission.
A new study found that many Australians have simultaneously been experimenting to keep the cockatoos out: bricks to weigh the lids down, sticks to keep them shut or even a rubber snake to scare the birds away. However, the study found that good defense just pushes the cockatoos to innovate.

2022-09-13,"The Oscars, Grammys and Tonys all had viewership gains this year, reversing recent declines.
But not the Emmy Awards.
Viewership for Monday night’s Emmys dropped to a record low, with 5.9 million tuning in to watch the ceremony, according to Nielsen.
That was about 1.5 million fewer than for last year’s ceremony, and it was lower than in 2020, when the mostly virtual ceremony garnered 6.1 million viewers, which had been the record low.
Part of the Emmys ratings drop can be explained by its Monday night time slot, which generally depresses viewership totals. NBC broadcast this year’s Emmy Awards — the four major broadcast networks rotate airing the annual ceremony — and slotted it for a Monday night to avoid a conflict with the network’s Sunday Night Football rights. In both 2018 and 2014, the last two times NBC aired the Emmys on a Monday, viewership totals dropped from the Sunday night ceremony the year before.

NBC did not disclose the number of people who watched the Emmys on Peacock, which was also streaming the ceremony live.
Of course, part of the ratings problem could also be with the show itself. Kenan Thompson, the “Saturday Night Live” veteran, hosted the affair, and reviews were decidedly mixed. The New York Times called the ceremony “forgettable,” and The New Yorker said the show “was ineptly written and paced.”
It probably didn’t help matters that the winners were a bit predictable. Both “Succession” and “Ted Lasso” won for a second time, in the best drama and comedy categories, respectively, and “The White Lotus” overwhelmed the limited-series categories, taking home five awards on Monday night.
This year’s Emmy Awards was a full return to the Microsoft Theater for the first time since 2019 (last year’s ceremony was held in a tent in downtown Los Angeles). Producers of the Emmys also put nominees at tables filled with bottles of wine and champagne, Golden Globes style, to keep the mood light, and keep viewers hooked. This time around, it didn’t work."
2022-09-14,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it had charged three Iranians in a wide-ranging hacking campaign across the world that targeted local governments, public utilities and nonprofit institutions, including a domestic violence shelter and a children’s hospital.
According to an indictment unsealed in New Jersey, the men, who remain at large in Iran, breached the computers of hundreds of people in the United States, Israel, Russia and Britain. They demanded ransom in Bitcoin after deploying malware to block access to networks or to steal data and threatening to sell or make public sensitive information if their victims did not pay up, officials at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. said on Wednesday.
The State Department, which is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to their capture, said that those charged worked for tech companies linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful branch of Iran’s military.
The cyberattacks were not directed by the Iranian government, which is in the middle of tense negotiations over its nuclear program, senior law enforcement officials told reporters. In fact, the men tried to extort ransom from Iranian businesses.

Nonetheless, Biden administration officials emphasized that Iran’s unwillingness to crack down on cybercrime within its borders, especially ransomware attacks, along with its history of hacking foreign adversaries, made it easier for the men to operate with relative impunity.
“The government of Iran has created a safe haven where cybercriminals acting for personal gain flourish and defendants like these are able to hack and extort victims, including critical infrastructure providers,” said Matthew G. Olsen, the assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s national security division.
The men, Mansour Ahmadi, Ahman Khatibi Aghda and Amir Hossein Nickaein Ravari, were indicted on conspiracy to commit fraud using a computer and other cyberextortion charges. The scheme, which began in 2020, is believed to still be underway.
The men remain at large in Iran, and prosecutors said they were highly unlikely to face trial in the United States. Officials said they hoped that by exposing the group, they might prevent future attacks. They also released an advisory providing details of the vulnerabilities the hackers exploited, including in the Microsoft Exchange email program.
In a joint move with several U.S. agencies, the State Department announced that it was penalizing 10 Iranians, including the three men, along with two entities for “conducting malicious cyberacts, including ransomware activity,” according to a statement.

All of those named were current or former employees of Najee Technology and the Afkar System Yazd Company, which the State Department has linked to the Revolutionary Guards.
It is not clear how much ransom money the men extracted, but some demands were paid, officials said. Prosecutors believe that the targets of the cyberattacks, identified only by location and a general description of their operations, were selected for no other reason than their systems were known to have vulnerabilities.
In several cases, the men hacked into computer systems; encrypted data using BitLocker, a commercially available software program used to protect information; then demanded payment in exchange for the data, the court filing said.
Victims included a township in Union County, N.J.; a construction business working on critical infrastructure projects and a public housing authority, both in Washington State; accounting firms in Illinois and New Jersey; a county government in Wyoming; and a domestic violence shelter in Pennsylvania.
Two electric power utilities, in Mississippi and Indiana, were also breached, but the intrusion did not affect their operations or cause any power disruptions, officials said.

In February 2021, the men targeted a township in Union County, gained control of its computer network, stole data and employed a hacking tool to set up remote access using a domain registered to Mr. Ahmadi, court documents showed.
In June 2021, the group gained access to the computer network at a children’s hospital, created unauthorized accounts, stole data and tried to encrypt information. Once alerted to the breach, administrators were able to repel the attack without any effect on patient care or medical services.
Last December, the hackers froze access to data at the domestic violence shelter, then ordered the printers to spit out a ransom note that read: “Hi. Do not take any action for recovery. Your files may be corrupted and not recoverable.”
The shelter’s operators quickly agreed to pay Mr. Khatibi Aghda one Bitcoin, then worth $13,000.
They deposited it to his Bitcoin wallet and he freed up their files, prosecutors said.

2022-09-15,"Uber discovered its computer network had been breached on Thursday, leading the company to take several of its internal communications and engineering systems offline as it investigated the extent of the hack.
The breach appeared to have compromised many of Uber’s internal systems, and a person claiming responsibility for the hack sent images of email, cloud storage and code repositories to cybersecurity researchers and The New York Times.
“They pretty much have full access to Uber,” said Sam Curry, a security engineer at Yuga Labs who corresponded with the person who claimed to be responsible for the breach. “This is a total compromise, from what it looks like.”
An Uber spokesman said the company was investigating the breach and contacting law enforcement officials.

Uber employees were instructed not to use the company’s internal messaging service, Slack, and found that other internal systems were inaccessible, said two employees, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Shortly before the Slack system was taken offline on Thursday afternoon, Uber employees received a message that read, “I announce I am a hacker and Uber has suffered a data breach.” The message went on to list several internal databases that the hacker claimed had been compromised.
The hacker compromised a worker’s Slack account and used it to send the message, the Uber spokesman said. It appeared that the hacker was later able to gain access to other internal systems, posting an explicit photo on an internal information page for employees.
The person who claimed responsibility for the hack told The New York Times that he had sent a text message to an Uber worker claiming to be a corporate information technology person. The worker was persuaded to hand over a password that allowed the hacker to gain access to Uber’s systems, a technique known as social engineering.
“These types of social engineering attacks to gain a foothold within tech companies have been increasing,” said Rachel Tobac, chief executive of SocialProof Security. Ms. Tobac pointed to the 2020 hack of Twitter, in which teenagers used social engineering to break into the company. Similar social engineering techniques were used in recent breaches at Microsoft and Okta.

“We are seeing that attackers are getting smart and also documenting what is working,” Ms. Tobac said. “They have kits now that make it easier to deploy and use these social engineering methods. It’s become almost commoditized.”

The hacker, who provided screenshots of internal Uber systems to demonstrate his access, said that he was 18 years old and had been working on his cybersecurity skills for several years. He said he had broken into Uber’s systems because the company had weak security. In the Slack message that announced the breach, the person also said Uber drivers should receive higher pay.
The person appeared to have access to Uber source code, email and other internal systems, Mr. Curry said. “It seems like maybe they’re this kid who got into Uber and doesn’t know what to do with it, and is having the time of his life,” he said.
In an internal email that was seen by The New York Times, an Uber executive told employees that the hack was under investigation. “We don’t have an estimate right now as to when full access to tools will be restored, so thank you for bearing with us,” wrote Latha Maripuri, Uber’s chief information security officer.
It was not the first time that a hacker had stolen data from Uber. In 2016, hackers stole information from 57 million driver and rider accounts and then approached Uber and demanded $100,000 to delete their copy of the data. Uber arranged the payment but kept the breach a secret for more than a year.

Joe Sullivan, who was Uber’s top security executive at the time, was fired for his role in the company’s response to the hack. Mr. Sullivan was charged with obstructing justice for failing to disclose the breach to regulators and is currently on trial.
Lawyers for Mr. Sullivan have argued that other employees were responsible for regulatory disclosures and said the company had scapegoated Mr. Sullivan."

Members of Congress have access to information that ordinary Americans don’t. They meet with chief executives, read classified intelligence reports and help set the rules by which the economy works.
That level of knowledge can give them an advantage if they or their families want to invest in the stock market — and many of them do: Nearly one in five members of Congress, from both parties, have in recent years bought stocks that intersected with their congressional committee work, a Times investigation found. And that’s probably an underestimate because lawmakers’ work extends beyond their committee duties, my colleague Kate Kelly, who reported on the story, told me.
Among the conflicts uncovered:
The wife of Representative Alan Lowenthal, a California Democrat, sold Boeing shares a day before a House committee that he sits on released a report exposing the company’s mishandling of its 737 Max jet, which had been involved in two deadly crashes.
Representative John Rose, a Republican of Tennessee, sold $100,000 to $250,000 in Wells Fargo stock a few months before a committee he is on released a report that was critical of the bank.
Senator Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican on the Armed Services Committee, and his wife sold options tied to Microsoft less than two weeks before the company lost a $10 billion contract with the Defense Department.

In many of these cases, little or no evidence directly links congressional work to a purchase or a sale. Most lawmakers questioned about potential conflicts of interest say that they followed the law or that a relative or broker with no knowledge of their congressional work made a purchase or sale.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But that demonstrates the problem: Lawmakers can profit from their inside knowledge while remaining within the bounds of the law but creating, at a minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Widespread distrust
The trades exacerbate many voters’ sense that politicians put their own interests above the public’s or the country’s. That, in turn, helps fuel Americans’ distrust of their government. Congress in particular consistently scores poorly in surveys about confidence in institutions.
Each of the past three presidents promised to restore that trust, in his own way. Barack Obama campaigned on his anticorruption record and later signed a law trying to stop congressional insider trading. Donald Trump vowed to “drain the swamp” of corruption and self-dealing (though his administration was plagued by ethics scandals). President Biden has called on Congress to prove that “democracy still works” and that government “can deliver for our people.”
The institutional distrust can pose a threat to democracy, scholars warn. If Americans don’t believe the government is working for them, they may be more likely to support alternatives, even nondemocratic options. In other countries, authoritarians have tapped into public distrust to justify more extreme measures and changes, eroding democracy around the world.

Potential solutions
Lawmakers have proposed bills to restrict their own stock trading. Some proposals would bar members of Congress and their spouses from buying stocks, a measure that majorities of voters support. Other legislation would force lawmakers and their spouses to put their investments into blind trusts.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
On Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised a House vote on a congressional stock-trading bill this month. But neither that bill nor any other appears to have the bipartisan support needed to pass the Senate.
Why? For one, congressional stock trading can be a genuinely tricky issue. Some proposals would effectively force spouses to abandon yearslong careers that preceded a lawmaker’s time in Congress. That would be the case with, for example, Pelosi and Senator Tina Smith, whose husbands are professional investors.
It’s also unclear where to draw the line. Should lawmakers’ children, for example, be barred from buying stocks? (Some members of Congress think so: Representative Angie Craig said her college-age son had bought stocks without her knowledge. She told The Times that she disapproved of her son’s purchases and wanted to pass a law “to force him to listen to his mother.”)
And despite the optics, members of Congress may not be profiting much. Lawmakers’ stock purchases and sales from 2012 to 2020 did not perform better than other, similar stocks, a recent study found.

Still, there may be a simpler explanation for why lawmakers haven’t passed a bill, Kate said: “It’s not in their personal interest.”

2022-09-21,"Bowing to what he called an “unforgiving climate,” Robert Sarver said Wednesday that he planned to sell the Phoenix Suns and Mercury amid public pressure after an N.B.A. investigation found that he had mistreated team employees for years.
It was a swift turnabout for Sarver, who seemed determined to hold onto his stakes in both basketball franchises after the N.B.A. last week fined him $10 million and suspended him from team operations for one year. According to the investigation’s report, Sarver had engaged in more than a decade of workplace misconduct, including using racial slurs, making sexual remarks and treating women inequitably.
But following the punitive measures, Sarver — and the N.B.A. — faced mounting public pressure to levy a harsher punishment for behavior N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver had described as “beyond the pale.”
In a statement Wednesday, Sarver said his one-year suspension would have given him time to “make amends and remove my personal controversy” from the teams that he owns.

“But in our current unforgiving climate,” he said, “it has become painfully clear that that is no longer possible — that whatever good I have done, or could still do, is outweighed by things I have said in the past.”
In separate statements, Silver and Suns Legacy Partners L.L.C., the ownership group of the Suns and Mercury, said Sarver’s decision was the best choice for the organization and the community.
“We also know that today’s news does not change the work that remains in front of us,” the ownership group said, adding: “We acknowledge the courage of the people who came forward in this process to tell their stories and apologize to those hurt.”
An N.B.A. spokesman declined to comment when asked whether Silver had pushed Sarver to sell the teams. Last week, Silver defended the fine and suspension issued to Sarver as fair punishment and said he had not asked him to voluntarily sell the teams. The N.B.A.’s board of governors also had not discussed removing him as an owner, he said. Silver could have suspended Sarver for longer than one year, but $10 million was the most he could fine him.
The N.B.A. announced its penalties Sept. 13 after releasing a 43-page public report by the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which conducted a nearly yearlong investigation into Sarver’s conduct in his 18 years with the basketball teams. The N.B.A. began its investigation in response to a November 2021 article by ESPN about accusations of mistreatment against Sarver. The law firm said its investigators interviewed more than 100 individuals who witnessed behavior that “violated applicable standards.”

Sarver, according to the report, made crude jokes, used “the N-word” on at least five occasions, shared inappropriate text messages and photos, and belittled employees. During the investigation, Sarver sought to defend himself by citing his contributions to social and racial justice causes and his support of women’s basketball.
In a statement Wednesday, W.N.B.A. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the league was committed to diversity and inclusion and welcomed the news of Sarver’s decision to sell the Mercury. She had described his fine and suspension as “appropriate and necessary.”
Last week, Suns guard Chris Paul and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James quickly criticized the N.B.A.’s punishment as insufficient. Paul said he was “horrified and disappointed” by what he had read in the report and described Sarver’s behavior as “atrocious.” Tamika Tremaglio, the executive director of the N.B.A. players’ union, said last week that Sarver should be barred from the league for life.
On Wednesday, New Orleans Pelicans guard CJ McCollum, the president of the N.B.A. players’ union, said in a statement that Sarver had made “a swift decision that was in the best interest of our sports community.”
After Sarver announced his plans to sell the Phoenix teams, James said on Twitter that he was “proud to be a part of a league committed to progress,” striking a different note from a week ago when he said the N.B.A. “definitely got this wrong” with its punishment.

“I love this league and I deeply respect our leadership. But this isn’t right,” James said in a tweet last week. “There is no place for misogyny, sexism, and racism in any work place. Don’t matter if you own the team or play for the team. We hold our league up as an example of our values and this aint it.”
The harshest penalty the league has ever levied on a team owner came in 2014 when Donald Sterling, then the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was barred for life after he made racist remarks about Black people in a private conversation and a recording of his comments was made public.
Steve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, agreed to buy the Clippers for about $2 billion just one month later. The quick sale was facilitated when medical experts declared that Sterling was “mentally incapacitated,” which allowed his wife, Rochelle, to have sole trusteeship of the team and negotiate a deal.
Yet selling professional sports teams is often a drawn-out process that can take months or even years.
Owners typically hire one of a handful of bankers who specialize in such transactions. That banker solicits bids from billionaires, corporations or, increasingly, large coalitions of individuals. Sometimes there is a more traditional auction process. Once an agreement is reached, the potential new owner or owners have to be vetted and approved by a vote of the N.B.A.’s board of governors, which includes owners from all 30 teams.

There are a number of factors that can complicate a sale, some of which are present with the Phoenix Suns.
While Sarver controls the Suns and the Mercury, he owns just 35 percent of Suns Legacy Partners L.L.C., the legal entity that owns the teams. Potential buyers may want to purchase 100 percent of the teams, which would involve negotiating with other members of the ownership group — though some of them may want to buy the team and may have a leg up after already having been vetted and approved by the N.B.A.
Arenas and associated commercial development can also complicate sales. While the Suns ownership group manages the Footprint Center, where the Suns and the Mercury play their home games, the arena is owned by the City of Phoenix.
Teams usually sell to those willing to pay the most money, but not always. Sometimes owners value non-monetary terms, like an agreement to keep a team in a specific city, and the method and terms of payment for teams can also matter.
When team owners have been more or less forced to sell teams, the outcomes have varied widely.
In 2017, Jerry Richardson announced he would sell the Carolina Panthers shortly after Sports Illustrated reported allegations of workplace misconduct. Five months later, after a fairly typical sales process, David Tepper agreed to buy the Panthers for at least $2.2 billion, which was the highest price for an N.F.L. team at the time.

The sale of Real Salt Lake, an M.L.S. team, took much longer. In August 2020, M.L.S. announced that Dell Loy Hansen would sell the team, after Hansen was reported to have made racist comments. It took 17 months for Hansen and M.L.S. to find a buyer, and the league had to operate the team for a season.
The N.B.A. has also agreed to less severe punishments when inquiries have found workplace misconduct.
In 2018, Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, agreed to pay $10 million to women’s leadership and domestic-violence organizations after an N.B.A. investigation confirmed reports of sexual harassment and other improper conduct among employees in the team’s front office.
Cuban did not face accusations of misconduct, but the investigation found his supervision lacking. According to the report, Terdema Ussery, the former team president and chief executive, was one of several high-ranking team officials who had engaged in inappropriate conduct toward female employees.
After the report was released, Cuban apologized and said he had missed opportunities to correct the culture of his organization.

The cost of rebuilding Ukraine
This month, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine announced that the country had assembled a team of bankers and researchers to solicit investments from private businesses to help pay for Ukraine’s recovery. Zelensky said the team had identified more than $400 billion of potential investment for what is effectively a Marshall Plan for Ukraine, the U.S. program that provided aid to Western Europe after World War II.
Yesterday, DealBook spoke with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, about what it would take to rebuild the country battered by Russia’s war.
Ukraine estimates it would cost $750 billion. The country hopes to develop a fund to invest the money it raises for its recovery after the war, Shmyhal said. The initial basis would be confiscated Russian assets, but Ukraine also said it wanted help from private businesses. Mr. Zelensky met virtually last week with BlackRock’s Larry Fink, and Shmyhal said Ukrainian officials would meet with other American business executives this week.
Insuring investments could be an option for money raised during the war. “All private businesses understand that, for every investment, there could be a loss during the second a rocket missile flies and destroys it,” Shmyhal said, adding that Ukraine was pushing to make an international form of war insurance available for investments within its territory.
Transparency and anti-corruption efforts will be key. Transparency International, an anticorruption watchdog, ranked Ukraine 122nd out of 180 countries on its corruption index last year. Shmyhal said that the country’s European Union membership bid came with stringent anticorruption requirements, and that it had taken steps to safeguard investments in its recovery. He said Ukraine reported how it spends global aid to the World Bank. And its recovery fund, Shmyhal said, would “be open for our partners in which we invite them to participate on the management basis and on a supervisory report basis.”
No matter how much money Ukraine raises, geography will be a challenge. Unlike the 16 countries that received Marshall Plan aid, Ukraine will continue to have a neighbor — Russia — that wants to take it over (and other neighbors, like Belarus, that are sympathetic to Moscow’s views.) Also complicating Ukraine’s pitch for aid is war fatigue. Inflation, and in particular food and energy prices, has spiraled since the start of war, sapping the resolve of some in Western countries to commit to further relief efforts.

2022-09-26,"Uber was hacked this month. The company said that the attacker — a teenager possibly linked to the incident was just arrested in London — most likely obtained the corporate password of an Uber contractor. Using that person’s access, the hacker gained access to some of Uber’s internal systems: internal Slack messages, a finance tool for invoices and the dashboard where the company’s security researchers report bugs and vulnerabilities. It’s a big deal, and an embarrassment to the company.
Uber has said that it believes that the attacker is affiliated with a hacking group called Lapsus$, whose members are mostly teenagers and which has recently targeted several technology companies. Uber also said it had not seen any evidence that user data was compromised during the incident. In the lawsuits that will invariably result, we will learn more about what happened.
But any litigation against the company, whether it be by government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, or class-action lawsuits by shareholders or perhaps even customers, will focus on the proximate causes of the hack. More fundamental are the underlying causes of security breaches: Current economic and political forces incentivize companies to skimp on security at the expense of both personal and national security. If we are ever to have a hope of doing better, we need to change the market incentives.
When you’re a high-tech start-up company, you are likely to cut corners in a lot of areas. It makes business sense — your primary focus is to earn customers and grow quickly enough to remain in business when your venture capital funding runs out. Anything that isn’t absolutely essential to making the business work is left for later, and that includes security culture and practices. It’s a gamble: Spending money on speed and features rather than security is a more likely path to success than being secure yet underfunded, underfeatured, or — worst of all — a year later to market.

Security can be improved later, but only if necessary. If you’ve survived the start-up world and become a runaway success, you’ve had to scale to accommodate your customers or users. You’ve been forced to improve performance and reliability, because your new higher-profile customers demand more. You’ve had to make your internal systems work for your hundreds and maybe thousands of employees. You’re now an established company, and you had better look and act that way.

But in all of that, you’ve never had incentive to upgrade your security. The quick-and-dirty systems you built in the beginning still work, and your customers or users don’t know what’s going on behind the curtain. Your employees are expected not to tell anyone, like chefs being told to stay in the kitchen. And truth be told, it’s expensive and time-consuming to rebuild everything from the ground up with security in mind.
This is something I see again and again in companies, and not only in start-ups. It’s even the same thing that the former Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko (better known as Mudge) is accusing that company of doing. Companies large and small skimp on security when the market doesn’t reward doing any better. The result is that hackers have an easier time breaking into networks, and once they break in there are few controls that prevent them from accessing everything.
Some companies do manage to make the change. We saw it with Microsoft, when Bill Gates changed the company’s direction in 2002 with a now-famous memo. Google’s shift to a more robust security culture happened in 2010, after being hacked by attackers in China.
The lack of incentives obviously has profound implications for the security of all of our personal data, stored by a seemingly unknowable number of different companies who are all collecting dossiers on our movements and habits. It also has national security implications. We know that countries are stealing as much data as possible for their own purposes. China, in particular, is apparently using its resources collecting data on Americans in general. State-sponsored Chinese hackers are believed to be behind the theft of personal data on U.S. government employees, especially those with security clearances, from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in 2015. Hackers suspected of working on behalf of the country’s civilian spy agency were also apparently behind the theft of data on 500 million guests from the Marriott hotel chain in 2018 and about 80 million former and current patients and employees from the health insurer Anthem in 2015.

In all of these cases, the victimized organizations could have very likely protected our data better, but the reality is that the market does not reward healthy security. Often customers aren’t even able to abandon companies with poor security practices, as many of them build “digital moats” to lock their users in. Customers don’t abandon companies with poor security practices. Hits to the stock prices quickly recover. It’s a classic market failure of a powerful few taking advantage of the many, and that failure is one that only representation through regulation can fix.
We need strong regulations that force organizations to maintain good security practices. The focus must be on resilient security for the user data entrusted to the company. Government regulation should not be involved (for example) if Uber loses the source code to its phone apps or its employee Slack channel. Government regulation should be involved if Uber loses data about the rides taken by its 100 million-plus users. (One risk of this data for Uber: It can be used to find one-night stands, for either fun or blackmail opportunities.)
Worries that any regulation will somehow quell innovation are overblown. Good security isn’t incompatible with features, agility or time to market. But even so, a smart internet-security regulatory regime will take a page from successful industry regulations such as banking, and tailor requirements to the size of the organization. Just as a small local bank doesn’t have to follow the same level of regulation that a large national bank does, or a jumbo jet has a more extensive preflight checklist than a single-engine two-seater, there’s no reason a small start-up with only a few customers has to follow the same rules as a Twitter or an Uber. And as a company becomes larger and more successful, its security requirements should increase because the impact of insecurity increases.
In 2020, Russian hackers breached the internet infrastructure company SolarWinds. SolarWinds followed the trajectory from start-up to established company. This particular hack was a national security disaster. The hackers were able to use their access to penetrate the computer networks of some 18,000 SolarWinds customers, including U.S. government agencies such as the Homeland Security Department and State Department, government contractors, nuclear research labs, I.T. companies, and nongovernmental agencies around the world. Here again, the market rewarded poor security practices in the name of short-term profits. If the government mandated better ones, things might have turned out differently.
Last week’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, “Protecting Americans’ Private Information From Hostile Foreign Powers,” further highlighted that personal data privacy is now a matter of national security. And while regulation isn’t a panacea — nothing is in the world of security — it will serve to align corporate incentives with our broader societal goals. It will keep us all safer against both hackers and foreign governments.

2022-09-27,"WASHINGTON — With only months remaining before it closes up shop, the House Jan. 6 committee is wrangling over how best to complete its work, with key decisions yet to be made on issues that could help shape its legacy.
The panel, whose public hearings this summer exposed substantial new details about former President Donald J. Trump’s efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election, must still decide whether to issue subpoenas to Mr. Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.
It has yet to settle on whether to enforce subpoenas issued to Republican members of Congress who have refused to cooperate with the inquiry, or what legislative recommendations to make. It must still grapple with when to turn its files over to the Justice Department, how to finish what it hopes will be a comprehensive written report and whether to make criminal referrals. And on Tuesday, it abruptly postponed a hearing that had been scheduled for Wednesday as a hurricane bore down on Florida, even as its members disagreed publicly over whether the next session would be its last.
The panel had not disclosed the topics it intended to cover at its next hearing, and gave no date for rescheduling the session, which will be its first since July. But it is still working to break new ground with its investigation.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It recently had a breakthrough when Virginia Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, agreed to a voluntary interview about her role in seeking to keep Mr. Trump in office. That interview is expected to take place within weeks.
The committee also issued a subpoena to Robin Vos, the Republican House speaker in Wisconsin whom Mr. Trump tried to pressure as recently as July to overturn the 2020 election, suggesting that the panel tracked Mr. Trump’s activities long after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and his departure from office two weeks later. (Mr. Vos has sued to try to block the committee’s subpoena.)
“Our hearings have demonstrated the essential culpability of Donald Trump, and we will complete that story,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee.
But the committee has debated whether and how to highlight certain information related to the Jan. 6 attack. For instance, some members and staff have wanted to hold a hearing to highlight the panel’s extensive work investigating the law enforcement failures related to the assault, but others have argued that doing so would take attention off Mr. Trump.
And it has struggled in recent weeks with staff departures and is facing public criticism from a former aide, Denver Riggleman, who says it has not been aggressive enough in pursuing connections between the White House and the rioters.

The final stages of its planned 18 months of work are playing out against a shifting political climate. Polls suggest that Democrats could lose control of the House in November’s midterm elections. Mr. Trump is showing every intention of seeking the presidency again, and the committee’s Republican vice chairwoman, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who lost her primary in August, appears to be positioning herself as the party’s anti-Trump White House candidate for 2024, with the panel’s conclusions as part of her platform.
Ms. Cheney on Saturday seemed to contradict other committee members by describing this week’s hearing as unlikely to be the last. Other members, including the committee’s chairman, have said it would likely be their final presentation.
With that backdrop, the next hearing could be seen as the first step in the closing stages of the committee’s work.
“What they have to do is strategic,” said Norman L. Eisen, who was special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2020, including for the first impeachment and trial of Mr. Trump. “The first part of the endgame is to close the deal with the American people.”

The panel set high expectations for itself by revolutionizing what a congressional hearing could look like. Preparing for the hearing that had been scheduled for Wednesday had consumed the committee’s focus in recent weeks.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“They’ve pretty uniformly met and exceeded expectations,” Mr. Eisen said. “And when you’ve done that eight times, that suggests that you know what you’re doing. I suspect part of the reason that they took a lengthy hiatus — and by all reports worked very hard over the summer — was to be able to come back in September with a bang.”
To some degree, the committee is now competing for attention with other investigations into Mr. Trump and his allies. The New York attorney general has filed a sweeping fraud suit against Mr. Trump and his family. Prosecutors in Georgia are conducting grand jury interviews about efforts to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss there. And the Justice Department is now conducting criminal inquiries into both the events that led to the Jan. 6 attack and Mr. Trump’s handling of classified documents he took with him upon leaving the White House.
To help with its end game, the panel has quietly rehired John Wood, a former federal prosecutor who is close to Ms. Cheney. Before he left the panel for a brief, unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate in Missouri, Mr. Wood led the committee’s “Gold Team,” which investigated Mr. Trump and his inner circle.
It has also expanded its number of staff members from about 50 up to 57, according to Congress’s latest financial data, and has spent about $5.3 million over its first year in existence.
But at the same time, the committee has had five staff members put in resignation notices in recent weeks. Among them is Amanda Wick, a former federal prosecutor who was featured in a committee hearing and led the panel’s “Green Team,” which investigated the money trail connected to Jan. 6, including political donations and the funding of the rallies that preceded the violence.

The next hearing is expected to feature new video of the Jan. 6 attack and also new clips of some of the committee’s hundreds of interviews with witnesses. And the panel planned to include parts of a trove of evidence it obtained from a documentary filmmaker about how Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime confidant to Mr. Trump, encouraged violence before the Jan. 6 attack and sought a pardon afterward.
Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, said the committee would focus some of its energy on ongoing threats to democracy, such as 2020 election deniers gaining power over election systems.
“We have found additional information,” Ms. Lofgren said. “We worked throughout the summer.”
Committee investigators held closed-door interviews with senior Trump administration officials in an effort to uncover more about the period between Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Mr. Trump’s supporters attacked Congress, and Jan. 20, when President Biden was sworn in, including talks about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office.
The panel at one point considered inviting generals who worked for Mr. Trump to deliver firsthand accounts of his behavior. (The idea has not moved forward.)
Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee, said the panel recently received a trove of documents from the Secret Service in response to a subpoena it issued after the news that agents’ text messages from Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, 2021, had been lost.
ADVERTISEMENT

A spokesman for the agency said the Secret Service provided a “significant level of detail from emails, radio transmissions, Microsoft Teams chat messages and exhibits that address aspects of planning, operations and communications surrounding January 6th.” But the spokesman said the documents did not include any additional text messages, such as those sought by the committee that were erased during an upgrade of phones.
Members of the committee had originally seen their investigation, and the possibility of a criminal referral, as a way of putting pressure on the Justice Department to pursue a criminal case. But with federal prosecutors now investigating elements of Mr. Trump’s efforts to retain power despite losing at the ballot box, the House committee is considering a new suggestion for the information it uncovered about Mr. Trump and his allies raising money by promoting baseless assertions about election fraud: making a referral to the Federal Election Commission, a largely toothless body that can weigh abuses of campaign finance laws.
“F.E.C. would be a good possibility,” Mr. Thompson said. “Obviously we looked seriously at some of the fund-raising that went on around Jan. 6.”
Members have also been discussing what legislative recommendations they should make. Last week, to close off the possibility of another president trying to have a vice president block the certification by Congress of the Electoral College results, Ms. Cheney and Ms. Lofgren introduced an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act, which quickly passed the House. (Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, on Tuesday endorsed a somewhat different version awaiting action in the Senate, bolstering its prospects of enactment.)
Members are also discussing reforms to the Insurrection Act, legislation related to the 14th and 25th amendments and regulation of militia groups. They also are likely to recommend improvements to Capitol security.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Not all the panel’s recommendations have found agreement. Mr. Raskin, for instance, has pushed for recommending that the Electoral College be eliminated, but that idea has been met with resistance from Ms. Cheney and others and is unlikely to be included in the final recommendations.

2022-09-29,"Google said it would shutter the video game streaming service Stadia, its answer to Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation video game consoles, in another sign of Google’s drive to be leaner amid fears of an economic slowdown.
Stadia, which has streamed games over the internet rather than requiring expensive consoles, will shut down on Jan. 18, Phil Harrison, Stadia’s vice president and general manager, wrote on Thursday in a blog post. The product debuted nearly three years ago, promising to revolutionize how people play video games. But it failed to catch on with enough gamers.
“It hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected, so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service,” Mr. Harrison wrote.
Google will refund all game hardware purchases made through the Google Store, as well as game purchases made in the Stadia Store, Mr. Harrison wrote. He said the company expected to complete most refunds by the middle of January.

The company had already begun selling Stadia’s underlying streaming technology to other businesses, and said it expected that many Stadia team members would be “carrying this work forward in other parts of the company.” In February 2021, Google shut down Stadia’s in-house game studio, which had been formed to create new titles, prompting fears that the entire service might one day disappear.
Stadia is just the latest product to be killed by Google. The company is set to shutter Hangouts, its messaging app, in November. And YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, announced in January that it would stop making original content.
Amid rising inflation and concerns about economic instability, Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, has begun what he calls a “Simplicity Sprint,” an effort to improve business efficiencies and trim unnecessary expenses. The company recently cut funding and jobs at its in-house tech incubator, Area 120, and it has canceled unnecessary business travel.
Marc Rodriguez, the chief operating officer of VoxPop Games, said in an interview that he had mixed emotions about Google’s decision to end the service because his company had shared Stadia’s challenges, including competing with the gaming giants Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, and with the fixed habits of gamers.
Charles Yu, VoxPop’s chief executive, added, “Hardcore gamers are saying, ‘Well, I already have the hardware, and I’m used to using this service,’ so they don’t adopt, even if there’s a new technology.”

The planned shutdown was disappointing to those who used Stadia frequently.
“A lot of people like myself feel very betrayed,” said Jon Jameson, 36, of Lyman, S.C., adding that he felt “every emotion from anger to just feeling bad for the staff” who worked there.
Mr. Jameson, who has lived on long-term disability insurance since being in a car accident 10 years ago, said he had played games like Assassin’s Creed on Stadia every day, “looking for escapes when I’m not doing exercises.”
For Gabe Maier, 37, of Linthicum, Md., Stadia was a family affair. He has spent $1,000 on games and controllers since the service’s inception, and said he loved Stadia because his children could play on his phone or tablet while the adults watched television. He said that his young daughters enjoyed the game Pikuniku and that he had his own weekly playing sessions.
Mr. Maier, who owns an Android phone and uses many of Google’s products, said in an interview that Stadia’s looming expiration was “super disappointing.”
“It leans into the worst perceptions of Google, which is that they’re quick to innovate and quick to throw the baby out with the bath water,” he said. “The people they hurt the most are the people most committed to the brand.”"

The ties that bind
Technology stocks have long been seen as the market’s most rewarding but riskiest investments. Bonds have the opposite reputation. This year, both have ended up in the same place — deep in the red.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell nearly 3 percent yesterday, and is now down nearly 30 percent for the year. Meanwhile bonds, spooked by inflation and the Federal Reserve’s promise to keep raising interest rates to fight rising prices, are facing their most devastating period since at least 1926.
It’s rare for bonds and tech stocks to tumble together. In 2000, when the dot-com bust cratered tech, bond prices rose nearly 12 percent. Same was true in 2008. Tech stocks fell 42 percent, while bond prices rose 5 percent.
The alignment might be more natural now. Tech companies are more vulnerable to higher interest rates than they used to be.
One reason is borrowing. Apple, for instance, had just $300 million in debt in 2000. The iPhone maker now has nearly $95 billion.
Another is their size. Microsoft’s sales are seven times as much as they were 20 years ago. And as technology companies have grown, they are more tied to the ups and downs of the economy in general.
But don’t expect the relationship to continue forever. Venture capital and private equity funds remain full of cash, and ready to invest in promising firms. What’s more, higher interest rates will send investors looking for higher returns, and that favors tech shares. For now, though, higher interest rates, and the threat of a recession, are pounding every investment, and that includes tech. “It’s a painful quicksand moment for the tech sector,” said Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities.
Nasdaq futures this morning point to a mild rebound when markets open. But the macro data indicates more trouble ahead. Inflation is running red hot — this morning, eurozone price increases hit a record high — putting pressure on central banks to raise interest rates further to rein in consumer demand, placing the global economy at further risk of slowing. In such a climate, corporate profits could suffer, dealing another headache to investors whose portfolios hold a heavy mix of stocks and bonds.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Ian heads toward South Carolina. The storm, strengthened again to a hurricane, left about two million customers without power in Florida this morning. More than 2.5 million people near the ocean in multiple states were also under hurricane warnings early today.
The Senate passes an emergency funding bill. Legislation approved yesterday will keep the federal government running past today’s deadline and will send more aid to Ukraine. President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law by midnight.
The E.U. backs a power-reduction plan. Energy ministers agreed today to measures to reduce consumption and tame climbing gas prices. Steps will include windfall taxes on fossil-fuel companies and targets for lowering electricity use during peak hours.
Look to Nike for what ails multinationals. Shares in the company fell more than 10 percent in premarket trading after the company disclosed problems that reflected an array of economic ills: growing inventories tied to supply-chain disruptions, a need to hold more sales to liquidate them and weaker overseas sales because of a strong dollar.
Meta prepares for layoffs. The tech giant’s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, told employees this week that the company would freeze all hiring. Zuckerberg said a drop in the company’s revenue made the job cuts necessary.

Why Elon’s texts (and tweets) matter
Yesterday, a slew of text messages between Elon Musk, the Twitter board, Musk’s bankers at Morgan Stanley and a supportive cadre of Silicon Valley stalwarts were made public as part of the billionaire’s legal fight to get out of his $44 billion deal to buy the social network. The texts, revealed in a court filing, offer fresh insights into the rally of support for Musk’s bid. They also exposed how desperate Wall Street was to get Musk’s business, and shed new light on some fundamental issues about the case.

Musk believed bots were a big problem. In a text to Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, the day he told the company he planned to take it private, Musk wrote that it would be hard to fix Twitter as a public company, because “fake users will make the numbers look terrible, so restructuring should be done as a private company.” Twitter cited this text in its lawsuit seeking to force Musk to acquire the company, and it goes to the heart of one of the main legal arguments in the case: Despite his concern about the spam count, Musk made his offer without any stipulations around the accuracy of its spam numbers.

And the spam data may not help Musk’s case, anyway. When Musk first sought to call off the deal, on July 8, he cited an analysis by his own advisers that concluded that the percentage of active Twitter users who are actually spam is “wildly higher than 5 percent.” (Musk has said that Twitter’s estimates that 5 percent of active users are spam is misleading.) But according to a court filing revealed yesterday, one outside firm put the percentage at 5.3. Could such a meager difference derail the deal?

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Musk’s intent in buying Twitter could matter, too. Many of the texts between Musk and the Twitter board in the lead up to the deal — as well as those with his various supporters — center on Musk’s goal to rid the platform of spam and use it promote free speech. Expressing such noble aims could overshadow his complaints of bots and spam being part of some larger “material adverse effect” that’s eroding the value of a firm he once wanted to buy. “Courts talk about whether there have been sufficient changes to call the economics of the deal into question,” said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School. It’s unclear how that applies when the buyer makes clear the economics don’t matter much to him, Lipton adds.
Speaking of those text messages … Here’s a sample of the many that were released yesterday:
“Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job,” the investor Jason Calacanis wrote to Musk.
The venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson recommended Musk hire the former Uber executive Emil Michael as Twitter’s C.E.O. — and his own son as an engineer.
When Musk tried urgently to reach out to Oracle’s Larry Ellison, a former Tesla board member, Ellison brushed him off: “Sorry. Let’s talk tomorrow.”
“Maybe Oprah would be interested in joining the Twitter board if my bid succeeds,” Musk wrote to the journalist Gayle King, a noted friend of Oprah Winfrey’s. (King called Musk’s offer a “gangsta move.”)
Big banks face new climate resiliency tests
This week’s extreme weather in Florida heightened the debate in Washington — and beyond — about the financial risks that climate change poses to banks.
Yesterday, the Fed announced that six of the biggest U.S. banks — Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo — were expected to participate in a pilot program next year to test their resilience and risks under different climate hypotheticals.
The Fed said that the program was “exploratory in nature” and that it would not have capital consequences.

Environmentalists lauded the move. Adele Shraiman of the Sierra Club told DealBook the program was “long overdue.” She argued that there was “really broad consensus” among financial authorities around the world that climate risk is a reality, but that the banks and regulators were not addressing those risks fast enough. The storm in Florida has been a “prime example” of physical risk, she said, but the much less visible risks come from failing to transition to green energy, from continuing to invest in fossil fuel companies and from the possibility that those types of companies could fail.
Similarly, a report yesterday from Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group, said that banks were making progress on climate goals, but that important aspects of the business, like the $600 trillion derivatives market, remain a “black box in terms of climate risk.”
Climate requirements may be an overstep, some industry representatives counter. In response to the Fed’s announcement, the Bank Policy Institute, an advocacy group representing the nation’s leading banks, said that recent research suggested “that the near-term risks are entirely manageable for large banks” and that regulatory requirements “seem to be disproportionate to the risk.”
The conflicting stances are creating friction for banks. Whether climate change presents material financial risks has long been a fraught political question, so American banking officials have been slower to explore the answers than their counterparts in Europe. At the same time, Republican politicians are amping up their fight against environmental, social and governance investing, creating headaches for banks and making them wary of international climate commitments.

David Gottesman made billions from his ties to Warren Buffett.

Remembering Sandy Gottesman
David Gottesman, a longtime friend of Warren Buffett and a billionaire financier, died on Wednesday at age 96. Known as Sandy to his intimates, he quietly became a force in money management, as well as a major donor to charity.

Gottesman became one of Buffett’s close associates early on, after the two met in 1963 and bonded over investing discussions. Gottesman went on to found First Manhattan, an investment firm that now manages some $20 billion. But Gottesman’s most profitable decision was betting on Buffett: Gottesman invested in Berkshire Hathaway, gaining a stake that made him a billionaire.
“There probably has never been a better return on any stock held for 44 years in the history of Wall Street,” Gottesman wrote a decade ago.

Buffett regarded him as a close friend and adviser. He credited Gottesman with helping prevent an investment in a department store from becoming a financial disaster, and put Gottesman on Berkshire’s board. (Gottesman reportedly inadvertently inspired Buffett to invest in Apple when he lost his iPhone in a cab.)
“Absent Sandy doing anything financially for me, we would have been the best of friends,” Buffett told The Times yesterday.

2022-10-07,"Walk into any grocery store and it’s only too obvious that a dollar won’t buy much of anything, not even a quart of milk.
Inflation has done that. The latest government figures showed that in August, even a fistful of dollars bought 11.4 percent less food, 25.6 percent less gasoline and 6.2 percent less housing than they did a year earlier.
Any American consumer knows very well that a dollar doesn’t have the swagger it once did in the United States. Yet in financial circles, it is frequently said that the dollar is strong. I’ve written this in previous columns, and the claim is repeated constantly in headlines and speeches.
But what do we mean when we say the dollar is strong?
Recognize, first, that the phrase isn’t neutral. Given a choice between strong and weak, who wants to be weak? When it’s said the dollar is strong — and traditional U.S. government policy says the dollar should always be strong — that sounds unambiguously positive, with a precise meaning.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But the strong dollar is neither of those.
Paul O’Neill, Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2002, was forthright about this, after he left office. “I was not supposed to say anything but ‘strong dollar, strong dollar,’” he said. “I argued then and would argue now that the idea of a strong-dollar policy is a vacuous notion.”
Really, there are at least three meanings when we say, “The dollar is strong.” None is entirely good for American consumers or investors.
First, and most straightforward, the dollar buys more yen, pounds, euros and renminbi than it has in decades. It can be exchanged for more foreign currency.
Second, the dollar anchors international finance and commerce, a role once played by the British pound.
Third, the dollar is a weapon, one that the United States is using against adversaries like Russia and Iran.
In all three ways, the dollar is playing an extraordinarily important role, not just in the United States but almost everywhere on the planet.
If you are a consumer, an investor or just a person who wants to live peacefully and prosperously, the strong dollar is a mixed blessing, at best.
Purchasing Power
In the basic definition of dollar strength — its worth in other currencies — this has been the dollar’s best year in decades. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar’s value against six major currencies, was up 16.9 percent this year through Thursday, and hovering around its highest levels in 20 years. In direct matchups with the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi, the dollar is, likewise, higher than it has been in years.
This buys you better meals and drinks if you are an American traveling abroad, but it is a hindrance if you are investing in the stock of American multinational companies. Those with the most international exposure are being severely penalized in this bear market.

Consider two subindexes of the S&P 500. The S&P 500 U.S. Revenue Exposure Index, filled with domestic-oriented companies like Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth Group, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase — dropped 12.7 percent this year through Thursday. That’s not good, but it’s far better than the 24.8 percent loss of the S&P 500 Foreign Revenue Exposure Index, which includes Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Tesla, big drivers of stock market returns. On balance, the strong dollar has probably been a drag on investment, even within the United States.
For the economy, in the United States and around the world, the strong dollar has caused pain in many ways, too. A Sept. 29 analysis by Morgan Stanley summarized the effects of the dollar’s appreciation this way: “It takes a toll on economic growth, in particular through depressing the demand for U.S. exports and increasing the attractiveness of foreign goods and services.”
On the plus side, the strong dollar reduces the price of foreign goods in the United States. Inflation here would be worse without it.
So dollar appreciation coincides with the current policy of the Federal Reserve, which is focused on bringing inflation down.
That’s not always been the case. In 2014 and 2015, Federal Reserve officials said they would not raise interest rates precisely because the dollar’s appreciation then was weakening the American economy. And in 2018, during the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pointed out that a weaker dollar would help U.S. companies compete — only to be chided by Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, who said the U.S. government “should stick with the strong dollar mantra,” come what may, to protect the Treasury’s “credibility.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
At the moment, Morgan Stanley estimates, current dollar appreciation is adding to the effects of interest rate increases in the United States. The dollar’s rise is roughly equivalent to an increase of about 0.40 percentage points — on top of the 3 percent increases in the federal funds rate already imposed this year by Federal Reserve policymakers. In other words, the appreciating dollar is slowing the rate of inflation in the United States — but increasing it in much of the rest of the world — and doing all of this by weakening the economy both in the United States and around the world.
John Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management, put the conundrum this way: “Dollar strength equates to global currency weakness, fanning inflationary pressures around the world. Consequently, central banks in developed and emerging economies are confronted with the conflicting necessity to raise interest rates to fight inflation and support their currencies, despite weakening economic growth.”
As New York Times colleagues in Asia have pointed out, a rising dollar and a disorderly decline in the value of other currencies caused a global debt crisis 25 years ago, requiring international bailouts. If the dollar keeps rising now, it could disrupt economies in unforeseen ways.
The Heart of Finance
The dollar is the fulcrum of the world’s trading and financial system, a position that it has occupied, with periodic adjustments, since it supplanted the British pound during World War II.
The strongman role of the U.S. currency and the weakness of the British one were on spectacular display this month, when the new British government was compelled to reverse its fiscal policy in response to the cratering of its currency. It abandoned plans to cut taxes for wealthy people largely because the prospect of widening British deficits caused a run on the pound.
Thanks to the central role of the dollar, the U.S. government has been largely immune from such financial pressures when its habitual deficit spending has seemed imprudent to outsiders. In a world crisis — even one emanating from the United States, such as the periodic brinkmanship in Congress over the raising of the U.S. debt ceiling — investors tend to pour their money into the safest assets. Remarkably, even when the United States is causing disruptions, the haven of choice is, for the most part, dollar-denominated Treasuries.

A Formidable Weapon
The dollar’s primacy has always added to American geopolitical power. Now, the dollar is being increasingly used as a weapon against American adversaries.
Most foreign exchange reserves are held in dollars, and more global trade is transacted using dollars than any other currency. That’s given the United States the ability to freeze dollar assets as leverage against other nations, and it has done that through the decades against Cuba, North Korea, Afghanistan, Iran and Venezuela.
But with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its allies sharply escalated the “weaponization of global finance,” according to a recent State Street study, freezing nearly half of the Russian Central Bank’s estimated $630 billion in foreign exchange and gold reserves. The allies have also frozen the assets of individuals and Russian banks, and severely limited Russia’s access to the international payment system, known as SWIFT. Such sanctions are now a standard part of the policymaking playbook, for reasons that have far more to do with political and military power than traditional finance.
The Goldilocks Dollar
Forecasts of the end of the dollar’s role in international finance have been rampant — and wrong — since 1971, when President Richard M. Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, leading the world toward the floating exchange rate system that we now take for granted.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A new backlash against the dollar is developing, and a range of countries, from Russia to China and Saudi Arabia, have been working on alternatives in international finance. Some cryptocurrencies have been promoted as dollar substitutes.
I won’t hazard a prediction, except for these observations.
First, the current high dollar exchange value will surely reverse itself, as it has before, once the Federal Reserve pivots and worries more about economic fragility than inflation. Second, the dollar is slowly losing ground in international finance but until there’s a better option, predictions of its demise will continue to be premature. Third, the weaponization of the dollar is likely to hasten its decline because no country wants a financial system in which it can easily lose access to its own money.
Really, we will all be much better off if we don’t have to think so frequently about the dollar — about its puny purchasing power at home, its exorbitant exchange rate or its use as a potent weapon.
A strong dollar isn’t a sustainable goal. A Goldilocks dollar, one that isn’t overwhelming the world or underwhelming consumers, is."

The Bernanke years, revisited.

Debating Bernanke’s legacy
Of the three people who won the Nobel prize for economics yesterday, the one who stood out was the former Fed chair Ben Bernanke. Unlike the vast majority of laureates, Bernanke was able to actually apply his research — on banks and financial crises — to a real-world scenario: the 2008 market meltdown.
Bernanke’s work as head of the Fed was given only a glancing reference in the prize citation, but the award resurrected the debate over his handling of the financial crisis.
Supporters say Bernanke helped prevent a meltdown. In quickly setting up hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of bailout programs for banks and unleashing a wave of economic stimulus, Bernanke helped prevent the Great Recession from becoming a Great Depression, his backers say. His work also pioneered a whole set of tools for central banks to boost their economies, including quantitative easing.
“Mr. Bernanke’s contribution to economics can only be understood as a function of both his research and his leadership of the Fed,” wrote Greg Ip of The Wall Street Journal, “combining intellectual heft with small-p political acumen.”
“There is no doubt that his understanding of the precise nature of the crisis saved the global financial system in 2008,” wrote Stuart Trow of Bloomberg Opinion.
“I’ve been arguing since 2008 that the Fed did it right,” Andrew said on CNBC yesterday.
But others say Bernanke still has a lot to answer for. Even his supporters acknowledge that, as a Fed governor from 2002 to 2005, Bernanke missed the warning signs of the subprime housing crisis. Critics draw a direct line from his actions in 2008 to soaring inflation and economic woes today.
“Suppressing interest rates to historic lows and flooding the economy with bank reserves via quantitative easing distorted markets for every form of credit in ways economists still don’t understand — and then the Fed did the same only more so when the pandemic hit in 2020,” wrote The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board.
“This is a bankruptcy moment for central banking and the economics Nobel,” tweeted Sridhar Vembu, the billionaire C.E.O. of the software company Zoho.
Bloomberg Opinion’s John Authers offered a more measured take: “It’s strangely provocative for the Nobel committee to decide to make him the award at this juncture.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The Fed’s vice chair commits to fighting inflation. Lael Brainard said yesterday that the central bank was taking note of rising global economic risks — but was focused on raising interest rates to tame rising prices. Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase warned that the U.S. could enter a recession by the middle of next year.
The Bank of England expands its purchases of British government bonds. The central bank will now buy inflation-linked bonds for the first time, hoping to avert “fire sales” by pension funds. It also warned that dysfunction in the government bond market posed “a material risk to U.K. financial stability.”
A union rejects President Biden’s rail compromise. The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the Teamsters, which has 12,000 members, failed to ratify the labor deal brokered by the White House last month. If more unions follow suit, the U.S. could suffer a debilitating rail strike.
The nasal version of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine fails in a clinical trial. The formulation generated antibody responses in only a minority of trial participants. The results dampen hopes for a nasal vaccine, which would be easier to administer than injections.
A prominent billionaire investor renounces his Russian citizenship. Yuri Milner, whose firm DST backed the likes of Facebook and Snapchat, said he had given up his ties to Russia in August. Milner has long stressed that he has had Israeli citizenship since 1999 and made nearly all his wealth outside of Russia.

Welcome to the meh-taverse
Meta Platforms holds its annual developers’ conference today, almost a year after Mark Zuckerberg pivoted what had been Facebook into “a metaverse company,” committing billions to creating a virtual world where we can work, play and socialize.
Zuckerberg hailed the metaverse as the next “generation of the internet.” Wall Street too is bullish, with Goldman Sachs last year calling it an “$8 trillion market opportunity.” Shareholders so far aren’t buying it, sending the stock plummeting nearly 60 percent since the big shift.

Zuckerberg warned that it could take years for mainstream consumers to buy into the metaverse. The challenge: Even teens are on the fence, according to Piper Sandler’s biannual survey on the consumption habits of thousands of American teenagers. They found:
26 percent of teens surveyed own a V.R. device, but just 5 percent use it daily.
48 percent are either unsure or “uninterested” in the metaverse.
Meta’s real-world losses are ballooning. Reality Labs, the Meta division tasked with turning the metaverse into a big business, is still operating in the red. It’s racked up $5.7 billion in losses so far this year and over $10 billion last year, according to company disclosures. The division has implemented a hiring freeze after reportedly looking to cut expenses by at least 10 percent in the next few months.

Even Meta staffers acknowledge the rough start. More than a dozen current and former Meta employees told the Times’s Ryan Mac, Sheera Frankel and Kevin Roose that the early stumbles were becoming a big distraction. Vishal Shah, the executive in charge of the metaverse division, wrote on an internal message board that he was disappointed in how few workers were using Horizon Workrooms, the company’s virtual meeting app.

Musk’s take on content moderation
Even as arbitrage traders are putting good-but-not-great 60 percent odds on Elon Musk closing his $44 billion Twitter acquisition by month’s end, he seems to be thinking ahead about how he’ll run the platform. Musk weighed in yesterday on the Twitter suspension of Ye, the musician formerly known as Kanye West, for his antisemitic rant over the weekend. The intervention may have soothed Ye, but it’s generating plenty of questions and concerns elsewhere.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Musk, the counselor-in-chief. “Talked to ye today & expressed my concerns about his recent tweet, which I think he took to heart,” Musk tweeted yesterday. He had welcomed Ye back to Twitter on Saturday before his antisemitic comment, and had stayed silent on the matter until yesterday.
Musk is no fan of Twitter suspensions. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,” he tweeted in April. “If people want less free speech, they will ask the government to pass laws to that effect.” Using that bar, Musk would likely let Ye’s tweet stand, experts told The Washington Post, since it would fall under First Amendment protections. Meanwhile, states like Texas are pushing to allow individuals to sue when a platform takes down their content.
Musk’s less-is-more approach to content moderation has its limits. Even everyday Twitter users wondered how Musk will pull it off. “Musk’s plan to not enforce any Community Rules but instead try to personally talk each user out of doing bad things seems not scalable,” one joked. Indeed, creating a content policy that can handle a vast range of potential problems has been a core challenge for Twitter. “It’s an enormously complicated challenge for any company to do content moderation at scale,” Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s top lawyer and safety expert, said in 2019 on Joe Rogan’s podcast. “It’s not easy.”
Let’s see what Musk thinks — in as soon as three weeks.
Lifting the curtain on political donations
In the wake of the 2020 presidential election and riot at the Capitol, corporate giants have looked more closely at their political contributions and become more transparent about where the money goes. Companies have increasingly faced intense scrutiny for donating to politicians and groups that don’t align with their own stated values.
“As we head into a very consequential election, we find companies are much more sensitive to their spending and taking steps to manage the risks,” Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, told DealBook.
Every year, the C.P.A. and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at Wharton score S&P 500 companies on their accountability and transparency around contributions and build an index out of the results. This year there is an uptick in companies’ scrutiny of their own political giving.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Companies are drawing more lines and increasing disclosure.
Sixty percent of S&P 500 companies, or 300 firms, either fully or partially disclosed political spending this year.
Thirty-one percent, or 156 companies, said they wouldn’t make direct contributions to state and local candidates, as well as political parties and committees — a record since the index started.
In total, more than three-quarters, or 385 companies, took some action to control or provide more transparency on political giving, also an index record.
AT&T, HP and Visa were in the small group ranked at the top in terms of disclosure and accountability on contributions. Tesla, DISH Network and Domino’s Pizza were at the bottom.
Despite improvements, increased transparency is needed, Allison Herren Lee, a former S.E.C. commissioner, writes in a foreword to the report: “The political spending decisions currently being made inside U.S. corporations implicate nothing short of the survival of democracy in the United States.”

2022-10-12,"Follow live updates on the House committee hearing on the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
WASHINGTON — The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack is planning on Thursday to present a sweeping summation of its case against former President Donald J. Trump at what could be its final public hearing, seeking to reveal damning new evidence about Mr. Trump’s state of mind and his central role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election.
Armed with new witness interviews and unreleased footage of the violence of Jan. 6, 2021, the panel is planning to argue that Mr. Trump’s lies about widespread voter fraud inspired far-right extremists and election deniers who present a continuing threat to American democracy.
Unlike previous hearings, which focused on specific aspects of Mr. Trump’s attempts to overturn the election, members will attempt to portray the entire arc of the plan, demonstrating Mr. Trump’s involvement in every step — even before Election Day.
The hearing comes at a pivotal moment, weeks before midterm elections in which control of Congress is at stake and as time is running out for the panel to complete its work, including an extensive report on its findings. Should Republicans succeed in their drive to win the House majority, they would be all but certain to disband the committee in January and shut down any official accounting by Congress for the largest attack on the Capitol in centuries.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
To bolster its case, the committee has obtained more than 1.5 million pages of documents and communications from the Secret Service that include details of how agents blocked Mr. Trump’s attempts to join his supporters at the Capitol even after they had begun the assault.
The communications lay out how Secret Service personnel attempted to find a route to take Mr. Trump to the Capitol in a presidential S.U.V., and how those plans were ultimately rebuffed amid the chaos.
Secret Service staff initially attempted to accommodate Mr. Trump’s wishes, but supervisors at the agency expressed alarm, and District of Columbia police declined to block off intersections for his motorcade as a mob of his supporters began attacking and injuring dozens of police officers, according to the communications, which were described by two people familiar with their contents.
Robert Engel, Mr. Trump’s lead agent, broke the news to Mr. Trump inside the vehicle, prompting an angry outburst. Afterward, a Secret Service supervisor followed up to ensure Mr. Trump would not be joining the mob at the Capitol, the communications show.
The panel is attempting to refocus the country’s attention on Mr. Trump’s central role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election, including how he encouraged his supporters to congregate in Washington; agitated them and directed them to the Capitol even though he knew they were armed and threatening violence; and then did nothing to stop the violence for hours.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Washington Post reported earlier that the committee planned to use the Secret Service communications at its hearing. NBC News reported earlier that the communications obtained from the Secret Service surpassed 1 million in volume.
Among the documents turned over to the committee were emails, Microsoft Teams chat transcripts, planning documents, tapes of radio transmissions and surveillance video of the events at the Ellipse near the White House that preceded the rally where Mr. Trump spoke that day. The materials show documentation that some in the crowd had tactical gear.

The agency turned over the documents in response to a committee subpoena, which was issued after the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of the Secret Service, told lawmakers that agents’ texts from Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, 2021, had been erased as part of a device replacement program. Those texts have not been recovered.
The documents also corroborate parts of the testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide, who told the panel in June how Mr. Trump had become enraged when his security detail refused to take him to the Capitol.

The filmmakers said they plan to attend the hearing at the Capitol.
Included in the evidence are text messages that show that Mr. Stone sought a pardon in connection with the events of Jan. 6 and maintained close relationships with the leaders of two far-right extremist groups, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.
The footage also shows Mr. Stone using bellicose language, endorsing violence and laying out plans to create and exploit uncertainty about the election results to help Mr. Trump cling to power.

The panel also could use some of the testimony of Virginia Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas and a conservative activist who pushed to overturn the 2020 election. Her interview was not recorded on video under an arrangement reached with her lawyer.
Committee investigators also held closed-door interviews with senior Trump administration officials throughout the summer in an effort to uncover more about the period between Jan. 6 and Jan. 20, 2021, when President Biden was sworn in, including talks about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office.
The committee also has been investigating statements by key allies of Mr. Trump asserting that the president planned to declare he won the election even if the votes proved he had lost.
The session will come as the committee, with only months remaining in its work, still faces many significant unresolved issues, including whether to issue subpoenas to Mr. Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, a possibility that appears increasingly unlikely with each passing day. Members must weigh whether to enforce subpoenas issued to Republican members of Congress who have refused to cooperate with their inquiry, when to turn the investigative files over to the Justice Department and whether to make criminal referrals to the department.
The committee has tasked a subcommittee of its four lawyers — Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming; Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California; Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California; and Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland — to study the issue of criminal referrals.

2022-10-13,"Netflix’s ad tier is here.
The streaming company on Thursday unveiled the details of its big effort to jump-start subscriber growth after the company’s first-quarter revelation that it had lost paying customers for the first time in a decade. Beginning on Nov. 3 in the United States, Netflix will offer a $6.99 advertising-supported subscription called Basic With Ads, a lower-cost option that will show people four to five minutes of ads per hour of content they watch.
This tier will also be available in 11 other countries in November: Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Spain.
The ads, ranging from 15 to 30 seconds, will play before and during television shows and older films. For new films, the ads will play only before the movie begins.
Subscribers opting for this tier will not be able to download titles for later viewing, a prohibition based primarily on technical challenges. Netflix also indicated that “a limited number of movies and TV shows,” somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of those on the service, wouldn’t be available when the ad tier began because of “licensing restrictions.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“We believe that with this launch we’ll be able to provide a plan and a price for every Netflix fan,” Netflix’s chief operating officer, Greg Peters, said during a presentation to journalists.
Netflix’s current pricing options won’t change. The basic service, without ads, costs $9.99 a month. The most expensive tier, with the highest-definition resolution, is $19.99.
The advertising is being managed by Microsoft, and Netflix is working with two verification companies to ensure that the ads are being seen as intended. The company also said Nielsen would be able to analyze audience reach and specific viewer demographics in the United States. Those partnerships will begin in 2023.
Jeremi Gorman, Netflix’s newly hired president of worldwide advertising, said advertising on Netflix would give companies a chance to “reach a diverse audience, including younger viewers who increasingly don’t watch linear TV.” To target ads to the proper audience, Netflix will collect information on gender and birth date from people opting for the cheaper option.
Netflix also hopes the tier will bring in new customers and perhaps encourage those who have been sharing passwords with friends and family, a user number the company believes could be as high as 100 million, to stop using others’ accounts and pay for their own.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“I think it’s a really relevant and complementary approach because obviously whatever we do with password sharing, having people be able to land in a lower-price offering is a great way to give them a chance to find Netflix and pay for it consistent with that model,” Mr. Peters said.
The advertising strategy, first announced in April by Netflix’s co-chief executive Reed Hastings, is a significant change for a company that swore off ads for years, opting instead for “the simplicity of the subscriber model.” But Mr. Hastings, in making the initial announcement, said: “As much as I am a fan of that, I am a bigger fan of consumer choice. And allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price, and are advertising tolerant, to get what they want makes a lot of sense.”
Netflix isn’t the only streaming service to introduce ads after earlier swearing off the revenue model. Disney+ will introduce its advertising tier on Dec. 8, for $7.99 a month. The ad-free model, soon to be named Disney+ Premium, will cost consumers $10.99 a month, a 38 percent increase from the current price.
For existing Netflix customers, the programming will not change at all. Those looking for the cheaper tier will have to choose it. Mr. Peters said the company didn’t intend to steer users to one tier over another: “We want to take a pro-consumer approach and let them land on the right plan for them. We think that the revenue model will be fine as a result.”"

Tesla’s uncertain outlook rattles investors
Investors punished Tesla for cutting its growth forecast on Wednesday, sending shares tumbling nearly 6 percent lower in premarket trading, despite Elon Musk’s efforts to play down worries about slowing demand amid broader worries about the economy and growing competition.
It’s been a drastic fall. Almost a year ago, Tesla raced into the exclusive trillion-dollar club — joining Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet’s Google with market capitalizations in the 13-figure range. Recap: Tesla bulls set off a rally back then after the company’s deal to sell 100,000 cars to Hertz.
On Wednesday, Tesla’s market cap closed at just below $700 billion. Investors continue to fret about recession fears and rising interest rates, which will make car-financing more pricey. Undaunted, Musk told investors that the company would return to those lofty valuations — and even become the world’s most valuable company, bigger than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. “I will not let you down, no matter what it takes,” he added in a tweet.
Investors seem more focused on the here and now, particularly that Tesla missed out on its shipping targets.
Another concern: whether Musk will need to sell shares to finance his roughly $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. He’s already sold about $15.5 billion this year. Musk revealed little about his plans yesterday, but did admit that he’s “obviously overpaying,” for the tech company.
Big Tesla shareholders have been lobbying for a share buyback. Musk addressed this request yesterday, saying a “meaningful buyback” in the $5 billion to $10 billion range could come next year.
In the meantime, Tesla is struggling with the new realities of rising commodity prices and slowing global demand. As The Times’s Neal Boudette reports, the company sold roughly 20,000 fewer cars last quarter than it made, and it narrowly missed analysts’ profit expectations.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Warren Buffett’s favorite banker and a firm backed by Michael Dell team up. BDT, the merchant bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs banker Byron Trott, said it would merge with MSD Capital, an investment firm born from Dell’s family office. Trott, whom Buffett has praised over the years, will be co-C.E.O. of the combined firm with Gregg Lemkau, another former Goldman executive who leads MSD. “We believe strongly that our firms share a common mission and similar cultures,” BDT executives wrote to investors, “which will underpin our efforts to come together and unlock the full capabilities of our combined firm.”
Could market turmoil like Britain’s happen in the U.S.? Officials at the Fed and the White House quizzed investors on whether the kind of market meltdown that affected British government bonds was possible there, The Times reports. The answer: probably, but not imminently.
Britain’s government may be on the brink. Support for Prime Minister Liz Truss appeared to be collapsing, as an increasing number of lawmakers in her own party called for her to step down. Truss has had a torrid 24 hours, including the firing of her home secretary and one lawmaker’s description of her government “as a shambles and a disgrace.”
The Biden administration offers an olive branch to OPEC. The U.S. has quietly assured the oil production cartel that it won’t be subject to the same sort of price caps that the Group of 7 countries are imposing on Russia, Reuters reports. OPEC and Russia teamed up this month to announce drastic cuts to production, drawing President Biden’s public ire.
A federal appeals court undercuts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s reach. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the bureau was unconstitutionally funded, which negated the agency’s ability to regulate payday lending. A spokesman for the agency disputed the ruling, which was made by judges appointed by former President Donald Trump.

The companies having little problem with inflation, so far
On Tuesday, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, seemed to sum up the big fears hanging over the economy when he tweeted his concern about a pending slowdown, warning his 5.3 million Twitter followers to “batten down the hatches.”
One group that seems to be defying that advice: consumer goods giants, which continue to flex their pricing power. Squeezed by higher commodity prices, firms have passed on higher costs to shoppers by raising prices on products like cereal, detergent and diapers.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Consumers have been willing to pay up. Elevating prices to offset costs has enabled the likes of Nestlé and Procter & Gamble — which both reported healthy third-quarter earnings on Wednesday — to beat analysts’ expectations despite selling fewer goods, reports The Times’s Isabella Simonetti. Nestlé, the Swiss maker of Kit Kat, Nespresso coffee capsules and Purina pet food, raised prices by 9.5 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2021, and up from a 7.7 percent price increase in the previous quarter. The U.S.-based Procter & Gamble, whose brands include Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent, raised prices by 9 percent. Last week, PepsiCo disclosed it has increased prices 17 percent on an annualized basis on its snacks and drinks.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The global inflation crisis could sap any short-term gains. P.&G. said it expected a drop in sales for the fiscal year. Nestlé, in contrast, is sticking with its growth forecast. This comes as consumer prices in most advanced economies are rising at or near a 40-year high, even as central banks ratchet up interest rates to rein in inflation. The cost of one essential food staple — bread — has skyrocketed.

A few hours after P.&G. reported results, unnerved investors sent risky assets, including most stocks, lower. “It didn’t help to have Jeff Bezos join the recession chorus,” Quincy Krosby, an equity strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in a client note.

SPAC up against the wall
Dozens of the publicly traded shell companies formed during the SPAC boom are now running out of time to make a deal.
SPACs raise money in the hopes of buying a private company that is looking to go public without a traditional I.P.O. But there’s a catch: SPAC sponsors must complete a deal within one to two years. If they fail to do so, they have to return the money — taking a loss on the millions in fees that go to lawyers, bankers and others who help set up the investment vehicles.
The rocky market and generally lackluster performance of SPACs post-deal have made pulling off an acquisition more difficult. There are 533 SPACs that have raised money from investors still seeking a suitable acquisition. Of those, about 79 will hit their deadline by the end of the year, according to SPACInsider, which calculated the number for DealBook.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“This is for sure an unbelievably difficult period for this market,” said Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who runs SPACInsider. This year, 45 SPACs have liquidated or announced they will, returning as much as $12 billion to their original investors, according to the group. Last month, Chamath Palihapitiya, once a prominent and enthusiastic sponsor of SPACs, announced he was closing two of his deals and giving the money back.
But quitting is about to get more expensive. The Inflation Reduction Act’s 1 percent tax on stock buybacks applies to SPAC liquidations as well. Starting Jan. 1, sponsors will have to pay the tax if they liquidate.
Paradoxically, the SPAC is making a modest comeback. October is on pace to see more SPAC deals than June, July and August combined. But as their clocks run out, SPAC sponsors appear to be getting less picky. Parsec Capital Acquisition Corp. raised $86 million a little over a year ago, and its sponsors were looking for a space-themed merger candidate. This week it found a dance partner: Enteractive Media, which makes videos for casinos and gambling websites.
“My prognosis is far from perfect, but my life is perfect.”
— John Mack, a former Morgan Stanley C.E.O., discussing being diagnosed with dementia in his new memoir, “Up Close and All in: Life Lessons From a Wall Street Warrior.” Bloomberg’s review of the book describes it as “a rare opportunity to hear power’s unvarnished internal monologue.”

Biden’s newest crackdown on boards
In the latest expansion of its antitrust powers, the Biden administration successfully pushed directors of several companies to step down, after suggesting that they might be violating a seldom-enforced provision of federal competition law.
Among those who stepped down from a board: Larry Illg, who had served at Udemy; Randall Winn, who had been at Definitive Healthcare; Gordon Hunter, who had been at CTS; and Joanne Isham, who had been at Redwire. Three directors at SolarWinds also resigned.
At issue is the idea of interlocking directorates, where people simultaneously serve on the boards of ostensible competitors. The Justice Department cited Section 8 of the Clayton Act — “an important, but underenforced, part of our antitrust laws,” according to Jonathan Kanter of the department’s antitrust division — as a warning to the executives.
“Competitors sharing officers or directors further concentrates power and creates the opportunity to exchange competitively sensitive information and facilitate coordination — all to the detriment of the economy and the American public,” Kanter added. (None of the companies admitted to liability for breaking the law.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The move is also a warning shot against private equity, which Kanter has suggested would be an antitrust target for its efforts to roll up companies in various industries. The former directors at SolarWinds represented the buyout firm Thoma Bravo, which still owns a big stake in the company. (While not a private equity firm, Prosus — where Illg is an executive — is a huge tech investor.)

2022-10-21,"In Silicon Valley, crypto and the metaverse are out. Generative A.I. is in.
That much became clear Monday night at the San Francisco Exploratorium, where Stability AI, the start-up behind the popular Stable Diffusion image-generating algorithm, gave a party that felt a lot like a return to prepandemic exuberance.
The event — which lured tech luminaries including the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, the AngelList founder Naval Ravikant and the venture capitalist Ron Conway out of their Zoom rooms — was billed as a launch party for Stability AI and a celebration of the company’s recent $101 million fund-raising round, which reportedly valued the company at $1 billion.
But it doubled as a coming-out bash for the entire field of generative A.I. — the wonky umbrella term for A.I. that doesn’t just analyze existing data but creates new text, images, videos, code snippets and more.
It’s been a banner year, in particular, for generative A.I. apps that turn text prompts into images — which, unlike NFTs or virtual reality metaverses, actually have the numbers to justify the hype they’ve received. DALL-E 2, the image generator that OpenAI released this spring, has more than 1.5 million users creating more than two million images every day, according to the company. Midjourney, another popular A.I. image generator released this year, has more than three million users in its official Discord server. (Google and Meta have built their own image generators but have not released them to the public.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That kind of growth has set off a feeding frenzy among investors hoping to get in early on the next big thing. Jasper, a year-old A.I. copywriting app for marketers, recently raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. Start-ups have raised millions more to apply generative A.I. to areas like gaming, programming and advertising. Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm, recently said in a blog post that it thought generative A.I. could create “trillions of dollars of economic value.”
But no generative A.I. project has created as much buzz — or as much controversy — as Stable Diffusion."

2022-10-25,"Facing a strong U.S. dollar and weakening personal computer sales, Microsoft on Tuesday reported its slowest growth in five years.
The technology giant posted an 11 percent increase in revenue to $50.1 billion for the three months that ended in September, as profit fell 14 percent to $17.6 billion from a year earlier. The last time revenue growth was this slow was the quarter that ended in March 2017; Microsoft’s revenue has since typically grown 12 percent to 22 percent each quarter.
The results were in line with what Microsoft told investors to expect and included a less favorable foreign currency environment. The war in Ukraine and the economic turmoil in Britain have strengthened the U.S. dollar, depressing revenue by $2.3 billion. Removing the currency fluctuations, Microsoft’s business grew 16 percent.
Microsoft suggested that the difficult conditions might continue when it gave a financial forecast for the current quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. The company’s shares dropped more than 6 percent in after-hours trading.

In the most recent quarter, softness in the global market for new computers, which affects Microsoft’s lucrative Windows business, offset the strength of the company’s cloud computing services and its suite of productivity software like Word, Excel and security offerings. The company said it continued to see healthy demand in its commercial business.
Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, told investors that, in uncertain times, cloud computing helped customers manage the risks of supply chain shortages and energy costs. “We look at this and say, ‘This is a period when cloud is going to gain share,’” he said.
Sales of the Windows operating system installed on new computers declined 15 percent, as employers and consumers who had raced to upgrade laptops and other devices during the pandemic’s work-from-home boom returned to more regular buying patterns. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s finance chief, said the slowdown in consumer PC sales that started in September would continue through June.
Revenue from Azure, the company’s flagship cloud computing product, increased 35 percent, or 42 percent without currency fluctuations, slightly below what the company had told investors to expect. Azure’s revenue is largely driven by consumption, meaning that it rises as customers actually use the cloud offerings more. The results, and recent deal announcements, show that large corporate customers are continuing to move work to the cloud, though Ms. Hood said investors should expect Azure’s growth to slow another five percentage points in the current quarter.
Microsoft has succeeded in getting businesses to buy and upgrade subscriptions for suites of security services and products like Excel and Teams. The company raised the list prices of such product suites earlier this year and has pushed its premium offerings. In doing so, Microsoft has increased its revenue per user, which is “an enduring growth driver,” analysts at Bank of America recently wrote.

Overall revenue for Microsoft’s commercial Office 365 subscriptions rose 11 percent.
“A difficult economic environment is going to slow growth, no question, but it also gives them an opportunity to sell a really high value bundle of products,” said Brad Reback, an analyst at the investment bank Stifel.
The company is also seeing the pandemic-fueled boom in gaming slowly deflate, as sales from Xbox games fell 3 percent.
Ms. Hood said Microsoft was still investing in key areas, though it was keeping an eye on expenses and expected not to grow its employee head count in the quarter."

1. Most countries are failing to live up to their commitments to fight climate change.
Just 26 of 193 countries that agreed last year to intensify their climate actions have followed through, pointing Earth toward a future marked by climate catastrophes, according to a new U.N. report. The world’s top two polluters, China and the U.S., have taken some action but have not pledged more this year, and climate negotiations between the two are frozen.
Without drastic reductions in emissions, the report said, the planet is on track to warm by an average of 2.1 to 2.9 degrees Celsius, compared with preindustrial levels, by the end of the century — far higher than the goal of 1.5 degrees set by the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015.

2. John Fetterman’s debate performance thrust questions of health to the center of his pivotal Senate race in Pennsylvania.
Five months after surviving a serious stroke, Fetterman, the Democratic Senate candidate, cut a sharp contrast with Mehmet Oz, the quick-spoken former talk show host running as a Republican. At times during last night’s debate, Fetterman seemed to pause to seek the right words or offered a jumble of sentences to express his positions, leaving party officials anxious two weeks ahead of Election Day.
Democratic officials seized on a statement by Oz that abortion decisions should be up to “women, doctors, local political leaders.” Fetterman’s campaign argued that Oz’s comments would turn out to be more politically damaging than the Democrat’s sometimes halting performance.

3. Russia intensifies its propaganda campaign against Ukraine.
The Kremlin is framing the war in Ukraine as a counterterrorism operation in an effort that officials and researchers say is aimed at rallying Russians and denigrating Ukraine in the West. In recent days, Russia used social media and its news networks to accuse Ukraine — without evidence — of planning a dirty bomb attack.
The information operations do not appear to have swayed public opinion in the West, but social media posts on the possibility of a dirty bomb attack have gained traction in Russia.

Sheriffs, police leaders and district attorneys in some of the state’s biggest cities have noticed an increase in spur-of-the-moment gunfire in the year since Texas began allowing most adults 21 or over to carry a handgun without a license.
No statewide shooting statistics have recently been released, and police in rural areas say they have seen little change, but far fewer people are getting new licenses for handguns, and many law enforcement officials report encountering more guns on the street.

This summer, the Mexican government unveiled a report detailing its conclusions about the abductions. The students had been killed by drug traffickers working with the police and the military, authorities said. But the case has unraveled and the backbone of the report is now in question.

2022-10-27,"For much of this year, Amazon’s growth slowed and losses mounted as it faced high costs and changes in people’s shopping habits with the ebbing of the coronavirus pandemic.
On Thursday, the e-commerce giant signaled that its business was rebounding. But it also cautioned that growth would be weak, possibly falling to its lowest level since 2001.
Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle, posted $127.1 billion in sales for the third quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier, showing that high inflation has not pummeled consumer spending. It also returned to profitability, making $2.9 billion after two quarters of losses.
At the same time, Amazon projected that sales might slow to as low as 2 percent in the current quarter, which includes the vital holiday shopping season. Those estimates, which fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations, include a forecast that the strong U.S. dollar will continue to depress international sales.

The results come amid a rocky patch for tech giants. Microsoft, Meta and others have indicated in their earnings this week that tough days may be ahead. On Thursday, a day after Meta revealed that its profits and sales fell in the most recent quarter, the company’s stock plunged more than 24 percent, to its lowest level in at least five years. Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent of Google, also have declined this week.
“We are seeing signs all around that people’s budgets are tight, inflation is still high, energy costs are an additional layer,” Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s finance chief, said on a call with reporters. “We are preparing for what could be a slower growth period.”
He added that demand was particularly weakening in Europe, where inflation and rising fuel costs from the war in Ukraine have affected consumers.
Amazon’s stock dropped more than 19 percent in after-hours trading.
Prices are rising, but the volume of items selling is falling, said Guru Hariharan, whose company, CommerceIQ, advises large consumer brands that sell products on Amazon. “That is a very concerning trend,” he said.
After two years of breakneck expansion, Amazon has spent much of this year putting on the brakes. Andy Jassy, who took over as chief executive last year, has moved to swiftly cut costs after the company overbuilt in anticipation of an extended pandemic-fueled boom in e-commerce. Amazon has curtailed plans to open warehouses and worked to improve the efficiency of its fulfillment operations, and it imposed a hiring freeze for corporate and technology roles for its retail division.

In the third quarter, Amazon benefited from its annual two-day Prime Day sale in July. In the previous year, Prime Day had been held earlier than July. The company called this year’s event its “biggest ever,” and it generated about $6.8 billion in revenue — about $5 billion more than a typical two days — according to estimates from the investment bank Cowen.
Growth in Amazon’s cloud computing division was the slowest on record, increasing 27 percent to $20.5 billion. Amazon Web Services accounted for 16 percent of the company’s total sales but was the only division that produced an operating profit. Mr. Olsavsky said growth slowed in the late summer, as Amazon saw a “lot of customers cutting their bills, which we are glad to help with.”
Its international operations, dragged down by the strong dollar, generated $2.5 billion in operating losses.
The company employed 1.5 million people by the end of the third quarter, almost 100,000 fewer than at the start of the year.
Mr. Olsavsky said Amazon generated more than $1 billion in productivity savings, about half a billion less than executives had hoped. The cost to ship products grew slower than the number of units it sold. But the depressed sales growth makes it harder to operate at optimal efficiency, Mr. Olsavsky said, because the company can best utilize its fulfillment and delivery infrastructure when it has more orders.

Amazon’s lucrative advertising business, which Morgan Stanley estimates is worth about $185 billion, grew 25 percent to $9.5 billion, though there was a slowdown over the quarter as advertisers pulled back. The company’s subscription business, primarily Prime membership, grew 9 percent to $8.9 billion.
Mr. Olsavsky said overall operating profit was reduced by high costs to market two major video offerings for Prime members — Thursday night football games with the National Football League, and its new “Lord of the Rings” series.
In addition to the volatile economic environment, the value of Amazon’s investment in Rivian Automotive, an electric truck maker that has struggled to meet production goals, has added fluctuations to Amazon’s profits this year. That valuation rose $1.1 billion, contributing to Amazon’s profits in the latest quarter."

Data delayed at least 15 minutesSource: FactSetBy: Ella Koeze
Stocks rallied on Friday, finishing a second consecutive week of gains and adding to a recovery that has come as investors hope the Federal Reserve might indicate next week that it is preparing to slow down on interest rate increases next week.
The S&P 500 rose 2.5 percent, bringing its gains for the week to 3.95 percent. The benchmark index is down more than 18 percent since the start of the year as interest rate increases and worries about a recession weigh on the markets.
Investors have been closely watching company earnings reports this week for signs of economic headwinds. The biggest technology companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet, reported earnings this week, and the results were mostly discouraging.
But on Friday, investors zeroed in on better-than-expected results from Apple. The company reported record sales for the third quarter, and its shares rose 7.6 percent on Friday, even though Apple executives pointed to a slowdown in business at the end of the year.
The company is the largest by market capitalization, which means big gains or losses in its shares can influence indexes like the S&P 500.

Amazon, conversely, tumbled 6.8 percent after it warned that growth would be weak, with estimates for sales at the end of the year that fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations.
Profits at Meta, Facebook’s parent company, declined more than 50 percent compared to one year ago, the company said on Wednesday. After plunging earlier in the week, its shares rose 1.3 percent on Friday.
Next week’s focus will be on the Fed and its efforts to tackle inflation. Central bankers are expected to announce on Wednesday an interest-rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point. Though Wall Street seems certain of next week’s increase, for investors, the question now is whether the Fed will begin to slow its increases.
Optimism that it might indicate it is prepared to do so has helped fuel the recent gains in shares, though stock investors have built up their hopes on this front before only to see them dashed by the Fed.
Treasury yields also moved higher on Friday, with the 10-year note rising to 4.01 percent while the two-year note moved up to 4.41 percent.
In other markets, the Stoxx 600 rose 0.1 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 closed with losses of 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell by 3.7 percent and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.9 percent."

What’s Up? (Oct. 23-29)
Musk at the Helm
Elon Musk ushered Twitter into a new era on Thursday, completing a $44 billion deal to acquire the service. This outcome was hardly inevitable: Mr. Musk’s bid in April to buy Twitter was followed by months of reversals and lawsuits that brought the two parties to the brink of a trial. But Mr. Musk met an Oct. 28 deadline set by a judge to carry out his purchase, and he immediately began cleaning house, firing at least four top executives. The swift cuts suggest that Mr. Musk is going to move quickly to carry out his vision — and by taking Twitter private, the mercurial billionaire is not beholden to shareholders or required to make regular public disclosures as he does so. What he is planning to do remains somewhat hazy, but Mr. Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and said he would reverse the ban on former President Donald J. Trump from the platform. Mr. Trump said Thursday evening that he had been told his account would be restored on Monday.
Tech Companies Feel Economic Pain
Earnings reports last week brought grim tidings from Silicon Valley. Once relatively insulated from the consequences of inflation and cooling demand, even the biggest tech companies are now experiencing the same travails as much of the rest of the economy. Meta’s quarterly profit fell 50 percent from a year earlier. Microsoft reported its slowest revenue growth in five years. And Alphabet, Google’s parent company, reported a profit for the latest quarter that was down 27 percent from a year earlier. These companies still raked in billions in profits. But they have also collectively shed trillions in market value so far this year. And their problems go beyond rising prices and changing consumer habits. Many of them are struggling with the consequences of Apple’s privacy changes, which have limited the way tech companies can target advertising, and few have hit on fresh, profitable ideas for their businesses in recent years.
Making Sense of the Economic Data
G.D.P., P.C.E, E.C.I. — if this sounds like alphabet soup to you, read on. Fresh economic data released last week created a complex, and at times seemingly contradictory, portrait of the global economy. The U.S. economy returned to growth in the third quarter, lending some credibility to arguments that it is not yet in a recession — though that data belied other troubling signs in Thursday’s gross domestic product report. Similarly, economists warned not to put too much stock in Germany’s report on Friday that its economy expanded in the third quarter. Reports on the same day by both France and Spain showed that their economies had slowed, and economists believe that Europe is heading for a serious slowdown. New U.S. inflation numbers also landed on Friday, adding even more uncertainty to the outlook for the economy. Prices (in the Personal Consumption Expenditures index) are still climbing at a concerning pace, and wages (in the Employment Cost Index) ticked up, too. There may be some mixed signals from these reports, but the broad takeaway is that economies around the world are weakening.

What’s Next? (Oct. 30-Nov. 5)
Another Big Rate Increase
The Federal Reserve is poised to announce another three-quarter-point increase to its benchmark rate at its meeting this week, the fourth consecutive increase of that size. Not long ago, policymakers at the Fed expected to debate slowing the pace of the increases at their November meeting. But economic data since their last gathering has suggested that the labor market is still strong and that inflation remains stubbornly persistent, prompting them to delay any discussion of easing. Among officials’ foremost concerns now is that inflation could become a permanent fixture of the U.S. economy if they allow it to linger too long. The more Americans come to expect high prices — a troubling possibility suggested by some food companies’ quarterly earnings reports, for example — the more their behaviors will reinforce inflation.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Taking the Labor Market’s Temperature
This week’s jobs report is expected to show a resilient labor market, with employers adding an estimated 200,000 jobs in October. That would be a slight moderation from the 263,000 jobs added in September, which itself was a slight moderation from the month before, when 315,000 were added. So job growth is slowing, but perhaps not enough for Fed officials, who have said that the central bank is keeping a close eye on jobs data as it considers how aggressive to be. There have been some indications to that effect: In the last month, many companies have announced hiring freezes or slowed hiring.
A Boon for Big Oil
The global economy has its winners and losers, and as high energy prices driven in part by the war in Ukraine squeeze businesses and households, particularly in Europe — and particularly as temperatures drop — oil companies are the clear winners. Last week, Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron announced big quarterly profits, with Shell and Total reporting profits more than double what they earned in the same period a year earlier. BP is poised to complete the picture this week: Last quarter, the company beat analysts’ expectations, bringing in $8.5 billion in profit. With the midterm elections nearing, and gas prices, and the economy more broadly, playing a large role in voters’ thinking, these windfalls could strengthen President Biden’s calls for oil companies to increase output and cut prices.
What Else?
Mortgage rates rose above 7 percent, their highest level since 2002. Adidas cut ties with Kanye West last week after his antisemitic comments, ending a partnership that may have been worth close to $100 million annually for the rapper. Credit Suisse is overhauling its business as it tries to recover from years of losses and scandals."

Lawsuits on the horizon?

New battle lines over pay and layoffs?
Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter may have closed, but his battle with the company’s board and executives seems to be barreling forward. After what DealBook hears was a bitter closing on Thursday, Musk is taunting Twitter and the law firm it worked with in its lawsuit against him, Wachtell Lipton, with the prospect of litigation, while trying to avoid paying top executives the golden parachutes they’re owed. It appears that fraught legal battles lie ahead, and it’s unclear whether Musk’s aim is to win or simply punish.
“I would not be surprised at all if there are lawsuits involving everything from compensation to people he feels have withheld information illegally from him,” Walter Isaacson, the Musk biographer who shadowed him throughout much of last week, said on CNBC.
Musk is trying to get out of paying senior executives’ golden parachute deals. Here’s how that could shake out: Musk fired the executives purportedly “with cause” in hopes of avoiding payment. But it’s unclear what the cause might be. (Twitter itself has set a high bar for such firings, like unauthorized use of Twitter’s confidential information or pleading guilty to a felony.)
If the Twitter executives sue for the payments, it would likely go to arbitration. Based on the facts we know, it would seem they have a strong case.
The executives would have to pay their own legal costs. They could be reimbursed for at least some of them, as the employment contract of the former C.E.O. Parag Agrawal shows. But Musk could try to get out of that as well.
Musk could go after the board (and possibly executives) for fraud. It might look like this: Musk would sue the directors arguing they defrauded him into buying Twitter, similar to what Hewlett-Packard did in 2015. But Musk would need to prove Twitter materially and intentionally misled him. Simply not telling him things doesn’t count as fraud.
Arguably, if Musk thought he had a strong case for fraud, he would have proceeded with the Delaware trial. The new question becomes: Now that he’s been forced to buy Twitter, how much will he be willing to spend on litigation to punish those he bought it from?
Twitter’s board and key executives are covered by director and officer insurance, which fronts the cost of lawsuits over their management of the company. If they’re found guilty of fraud, however, they would need to repay those fees.
Employees could sue Musk over layoffs. While the timing and scope of layoffs remains fluid, they are on the way. If Musk does mass layoffs before filing a required notice under the WARN Act, employees could sue, as they did at Tesla. (The law requiring the disclosure has exceptions, like unforeseen business circumstances.) If he intentionally laid them off before Tuesday’s stock-vesting date specifically to avoid paying out a bonus, that could be grounds for a suit as well.

BP’s blockbuster quarter spurs calls for more windfall profit taxes. The oil giant’s third-quarter earnings more than doubled to $8 billion, continuing a string of soaring profits for the industry. That’s sure to bolster calls to impose new taxes on oil companies for what President Biden said yesterday were “outrageous” profits. (BP paid $2.5 billion in windfall taxes in Britain.)
Chinese stocks briefly soar on hopes of an end to zero-Covid policies. Shares in Chinese companies jumped nearly 7 percent today amid speculation on social media that Beijing was taking tentative steps to easie tough pandemic policies.

Toyota’s quarterly profit drops 25 percent amid a series of woes.

A federal judge blocked a book-publishing megamerger, agreeing with the Justice Department that Penguin Random House’s $2 billion takeover of Simon & Schuster might “substantially” harm competition. The case involved an unusual focus by federal prosecutors on the threat to author earnings, instead of harm to consumers: Essentially, it drastically widens the scope of how regulators view consolidation, to include the impact on workers and suppliers.
The three-week trial over the case drew in a who’s who of the publishing industry, including — as a witness for the prosecution — the author Stephen King. (After the verdict, King told The Times he was “delighted with the outcome.”) Penguin Random House and its parent, Bertelsmann, said they planned to appeal.
Could the verdict embolden the Justice Department to aim bigger? “Once you’ve come in and said that this kind of consolidation and these kinds of actions are bad for authors and for readers, then you look over at Amazon and see a corporation that has 80 percent market share, there’s only one conclusion,” Barry Lynn of the Open Markets Institute told The Times.

And the Feds also won a smaller victory, with potentially big consequences.  The president of a paving contractor in Billings, Mont., pleaded guilty to attempting to monopolize the market for highway crack-sealing services in Montana and Wyoming. It’s the Justice Department’s first criminal monopolization win in over 40 years.
Blackstone’s D.I.Y. leveraged buyout
Blackstone yesterday struck what is the biggest leveraged buyout deal by a private equity firm so far this year, buying a majority stake in Emerson Electric’s air-conditioning business for $14 billion, including debt. But to get the deal done, it had to do some D.I.Y. financing, illustrating the challenges facing the private equity industry in these tougher times.
The buyout firm and its co-investors will invest $4.4 billion in equity, while Emerson will roll over a 45 percent stake and lend Blackstone $2.25 billion. The big question was how to arrange the remaining $5.5 billion in debt at a time when banks have taken big losses from deal financing — or are set to, as with Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter.
That forced Blackstone to get creative, with the firm raising the debt itself over a matter of weeks rather than hiring banks to arrange everything:
About $2.9 billion in financing came as a term loan from banks who will hold onto the debt (a Term Loan A, for finance geeks) rather than selling it onto investors.
Blackstone sourced the remaining $2.6 billion from an array of private lenders, including an arm of Goldman Sachs and Sixth Street Partners. The Wall Street Journal noted that Blackstone has done this before, notably after the 2008 financial crisis, but never at this scale.
It’s a sign of how tough the L.B.O. business is now. Blackstone boasted that it was uniquely positioned to get the Emerson transaction done: “The size and breadth of our firm gives us the ability to do complicated transactions like this deal in less liquid markets,” Joe Baratta, its global private equity chief, said. But other investment firms may not have the same scale, or might have to pay a lot more to do their deals.

Hunt for green in October
Investors were in a buying mood last month. Hopes for a “Fed pivot” on interest rates, a smattering of decent corporate earnings and lower energy prices helped push global stocks into the green in October.
Quiz time: Each month, market strategists at Deutsche Bank rank the performance of more than 70 financial assets. The top-dog honor for October went to which of the following?
Brent crude
Gold
Bank stocks (the Dow Jones 600 Stoxx bank index)
The MOEX Russia stock index
Answer: The MOEX was the top-performing asset class last month, both in local currency and in dollar-denominated terms. It rose 16.5 percent last month — though it’s still down 38.1 percent this year.

Show business in California is stalwart in supporting political causes, but rarely does the industry turn on the wattage for, say, a school-finance ballot initiative.
Enter Proposition 28, which would channel about $1 billion in additional state money each year into public schools for arts and music instruction. The creators of “Everybody Loves Raymond” chipped in $1 million to back the proposal. Christina Aguilera recently opened her house for a $50,000-a-plate fund-raiser. Barbra Streisand, Katy Perry, Graham Nash, Lenny Kravitz, Earth Wind & Fire and Sheryl Lee Ralph of “Abbott Elementary,” among others, have done social media endorsements. The actor Sean Astin has rallied SAG-AFTRA around it. And that’s not to mention the Microsoft billionaire Steve Ballmer and the California State P.T.A.
Currently cruising toward passage, the measure arises from a familiar complaint and a less conventional confluence of forces. Arts and music programs were eviscerated in many California school districts when state funding was slashed during the 2008 financial crisis; in many low-income communities, the programs have yet to recover.
The movement to provide secure financing for them arose from the only-in-Los Angeles contact list of Austin Beutner, a philanthropist and former venture capitalist, who was helming the Los Angeles Unified School District when the pandemic hit.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
As classrooms closed in 2020 to curb the spread of Covid-19, hundreds of thousands of Los Angeles school children, most of them from low-income families, were switched to remote instruction. To keep them engaged, Beutner reached out to prominent business and creative people, including his own affluent friends and neighbors, for ideas.
The responses included a Snapchat book club led by Alicia Keys; a course on the Titanic aided by the director James Cameron; art classes created with Illumination Entertainment; and free guitar lessons on thousands of instruments provided by Fender. By the time Beutner stepped down as superintendent in June 2021, the district had started two schools meant to help diversify the region’s entertainment work force, with backing from the music producers Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine and a group of entertainers led by George Clooney.
By winter, the campaign for Proposition 28 was underway, with Beutner as a leading donor and a bandwagon of show-business support. “We pay attention when friends call,” Iovine said.
I caught up with Beutner at Santa Monica High School, where he was moderating a panel discussion with Dre, Iovine, the rapper Lil Baby and their business adviser, Paul Wachter. “I don’t know whose idea it was to take arts and music out of schools, but I’m a prime example of why it should be here,” Dre told the wildly applauding audience.
Here’s some of my conversation with Beutner, condensed and edited.
How do you know Lil Baby?
I know people who know people. Actually, he works with Paul Wachter, who I met through Arnold Schwarzenegger, like, 15 years ago. Paul is Arnold’s investment adviser. Arnold, I’ve known for so long, I forget how we met.

Networking seems to have so much to do with this ballot measure. Or was it the pandemic?
The head of Illumination Entertainment, Chris Meledandri, and I went to college together. The board chair of Snap, I’ve known for 30 years since we lived in New York together. But it’s more about the shared history of getting stuff done, among people who have been in the trenches together. Jimmy and Dre I got to know working on their school project. The Fender people helped in schools during the pandemic.
More on California
Smartphone Ban: Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a statewide ban on smartphone use in schools, joining a growing national effort to curb cyberbullying and classroom distraction by limiting access to the devices.
A Foreboding Fire: A wildfire that quickly consumed more than 14,000 acres northwest of Los Angeles signaled the start of what experts warn could be a dangerous and prolonged fire season in the West.
Tiny Homes: As the Supreme Court weighs whether cities can criminalize sleeping outdoors or in tents, Los Angeles is attempting to combat homelessness with tiny homes criticized by some as “inhumane.”
What will Proposition 28 do if it passes?
This provides ongoing funding for arts and music in all schools, without raising taxes. California law requires that about 40 percent of the state budget be set aside for education. This requires that an additional 0.4 percent be set aside to pay for art and music programs out of the general fund.
Doesn’t that take a pretty big budget decision away from elected legislators?
Yes, and the ends justify the means. In Sacramento, as a practical matter, those with the loudest voices get their needs met, and families who are struggling to get by unfortunately don’t get heard much.
This initiative is a little like the one Schwarzenegger led in 2002 to channel money into after-school programs.
Yeah, we actually learned from that initiative. It helped us get a lot of things right about Prop. 28.

2022-11-03,"SAN FRANCISCO — The technology industry’s slowdown came into even sharper relief on Thursday as Amazon publicly said it had paused hiring for its corporate work force and several other technology companies announced job cuts.
Amazon said senior executives decided this week to pause incremental corporate hiring because the economy was “in an uncertain place.” The move added to a freeze from last month, when the e-commerce giant halted corporate and technology hiring in its retail business for the rest of the year.
“We anticipate keeping this pause in place for the next few months, and will continue to monitor what we’re seeing in the economy and the business,” said Beth Galetti, the Amazon executive in charge of human resources, in a note posted internally and on the company’s blog.
At the same time, Lyft said it would cut 13 percent of its employees, or about 650 of its 5,000 workers. Stripe, a payment processing platform, said it would cut 14 percent of its employees, roughly 1,100 jobs.
Tech giants including Meta and Amazon have been slowing down their hiring for months, while smaller tech companies such as Robinhood and Coinbase have announced layoffs. But rarely have so many job cuts and hiring freezes in the industry been disclosed on the same day.
Tech companies have led the way for the U.S. economy over the past decade, lifting the stock market during the worst days of the coronavirus pandemic. But in recent weeks, many of the largest firms reported financial results that suggested they were feeling the impact of global economic jitters, soaring inflation and rising interest rates.

To understand the importance and consequences of Tuesday’s midterm elections, I spoke to Astead Herndon, a political reporter who has been covering this election cycle for the Times podcast “The Run-Up.”
Claire: Hi Astead. I live in Europe, where many people are only now starting to tune into the midterms. How would you explain to them, and others who need a refresher, why this election matters?
Astead: If the Republicans take back the House, it would change the scope of U.S. policy. We know they’d try to stop President Biden’s agenda. A Republican House would hurt Biden’s ability to respond to domestic challenges on his terms, like inflation, and to global crises — Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House leader, has signaled that Republicans might stop approving aid for Ukraine.
We’ve also seen a global rise in fears of democratic collapse. If the U.S. elects lawmakers who spread conspiracy theories about elections and who promise to tear down tenets of democracy, that will embolden autocratic leaders in other countries and weaken the United States’ standing in the world.

These midterms also matter because they could signal the start of an even more divisive era of politics. We should not assume we are at the floor of division — we’re going to get lower.
When you say Republicans would try to block Biden, what could that look like?
If Republicans take over Congress, some members will push their new House speaker to start impeachment proceedings of the president and members of his cabinet like Merrick Garland, the attorney general. Some Republicans have been ready to impeach Biden since he took office. Their complaints are about policy and politics, not accusations of the kinds of abuses of power that have historically been grounds for impeachment. McCarthy has tried to minimize talk of impeachment lately, seeing it as polarizing, but the hard right rank-and-file will almost certainly press for it.
You’ve been covering politics for years. What do you think we should be paying more attention to?
Democrats are asking their base to rally behind the idea of protecting democracy — that’s what Biden has said. But that base is mostly working-class Americans and people of color. And many of those people feel like the system has not provided tangible and meaningful change on issues that most affect their day-to-day life — like housing, wages or public safety.
A woman on last week’s episode of “The Run-Up” told us that democracy has never worked for her. She’s borne the brunt of poverty. Her top issue was housing. That’s not what the Democratic Party is talking about. While Biden and Democrats did pass funding related to housing, that money was drastically cut from the levels that most people who focus on the issue say was necessary to effect lasting change.
I also think that the media has done too little to explain Republicans’ built-in advantages. Their control of legislatures in some battleground states is backed by gerrymandering. We recently did an episode of the podcast about Wisconsin, and how Republicans have gerrymandered the state legislature in such a way that they have effectively shut Democrats out of power.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
There are so many races that it can be hard to keep track. Which are worth following?
It depends on what matters to you. Let’s say it’s action from the White House on codifying abortion rights into federal law: Look at races where Democratic control of the House hangs in the balance, and Senate races in states like Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia. If Democrats don’t hold both chambers of Congress, that’s not going to happen.
If your concern is about the strength of democracy, look at state races, like for governor, secretary of state and statehouses — especially with the looming Supreme Court case that could give more power over elections to state legislatures. You can also look at Wisconsin and Arizona, where there are huge stakes, not just for this election but for the Democrats’ ability to win future races. The Republican candidates for governor in those states, Tim Michels in Wisconsin and Kari Lake in Arizona, have been openly hostile toward elements of our election system — including mail-in ballots and early voting — that many Democrats say are necessary for them to have a chance at success.
When might we know some results?
The initial numbers may give us hints of larger trends. In 2016 and 2020, results in Florida gave us good signs of the level of enthusiasm of particular voting blocs. If the Republicans win Florida by a lot, that’ll be a bad sign for Democrats. The margins of Virginia, for example, could tell us whether young, college-educated white voters are going back to Republicans, because they make up a sizable chunk of voters there. But for a lot of results, we will have to wait for the total count, which might take days.

A humbling downfall for Sam Bankman-Fried.

Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times
A crypto giant’s fate is in doubt
Devastation in the crypto market continued on Wednesday, after the giant crypto exchange Binance announced a bombshell deal to buy its embattled rival, FTX. (The deal excludes FTX’s American operations.) The entire market’s capitalization now stands at $900 billion, down from $3 trillion just one year ago, while major cryptocurrencies were down by double-digit percentages. The damage is largely contained within crypto; both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed up yesterday.
But investors fear that Binance won’t go through with the rescue plan, and that more pain awaits after their industry’s biggest Lehman-esque moment to date.
What happened? Binance, an early investor in FTX turned rival, said over the weekend that it planned to sell its holdings in FTT, a token used for trading on FTX’s platform — a stunning move that cast doubt on the financial health of FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research. The token’s value has plunged by roughly 80 percent in the past 36 hours to just under $5.
Image
Traders withdrew over $1.2 billion from FTX on Monday alone, according to the research firm Nansen. By Tuesday, FTX had stopped processing withdrawals; its chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was reportedly casting about for a financial lifeline from billionaires, finally turned to Binance for salvation.

Binance has cemented its dominance over crypto. It was already the largest exchange worldwide for digital currencies and derivatives; FTX’s trading volumes in September were just a fraction of Binance’s. Its founder, Changpeng Zhao — widely known as CZ — showed off his power by effectively kneecapping FTX and then swooping in with a rescue. “This elevates Zhao as the most powerful player in crypto,” Ilan Solot of the derivatives trader Marex Solutions told The Financial Times.
It’s a humbling downfall for Bankman-Fried, who in just three years rocketed from obscurity to become one of the best-known moguls in crypto, earning comparisons to Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan. Months ago, Bankman-Fried sought to live up to the Morgan comparison, swooping in to bail out troubled crypto companies like Celsius and Voyager Digital (deals whose status is now unclear); he also became a frequent presence in Washington, calling for more regulation of the crypto industry, to the ire of CZ and other executives.
At the beginning of the year, FTX was valued at $32 billion, backed by heavyweight investors like BlackRock, SoftBank and Tiger Global. (Investors said yesterday they were blindsided by the deal.) The 30-year-old Bankman-Fried — known in the crypto world as S.B.F. — was said to have a net worth of over $16 billion. But a document leaked to CoinDesk purportedly showed that FTX and Alameda, whose finances had long been murky, were highly illiquid and financially vulnerable.
The crypto world fears other shoes will drop. Investors worry that CZ may yet pull out of his rescue deal: He noted on Tuesday that the transaction was nonbinding and subject to due diligence. Meanwhile, tokens associated with FTX, including Solana, have continued to plunge in value.

Other crypto players sought to distance themselves from the FTX meltdown. Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, the biggest U.S.-focused exchange, said FTX’s troubles appeared to arise from “risky business practices” that his company doesn’t engage in. Still, Coinbase shares fell nearly 11 percent yesterday.
And regulators say the news justifies more scrutiny of crypto companies. “This is a major market event for the digital asset sector,” said Joe Rotunda of the Texas State Securities Board Enforcement Division, which had already been investigating FTX.

Elon Musk sells billions more in Tesla stock to pay for his Twitter deal. He sold nearly $4 billion worth of shares in recent days, according to regulatory filings, bringing his total sales for the year to $36 billion. The electric carmaker’s shares were up slightly in premarket trading.

The red wave that wasn’t
Republicans haven’t quite had the night they expected. As of 7 a.m. Eastern, Republicans were 21 seats shy of retaking control of the House. But leadership of the Senate remains up in the air after the Democrats flipped a seat in Pennsylvania. Here are the big highlights so far:
Pennsylvania: John Fetterman, the state’s Democratic lieutenant governor, beat Mehmet Oz in the closely watched Senate race. Political analysts now say Democrats need to win two of three hotly contested Senate races — in Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all currently held by Democrats — to maintain power in the chamber.
Georgia: The Senate contest looks like it’s headed for a runoff on Dec. 6, pitting the incumbent, Raphael Warnock, against his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker.
Governor races: Voters backed high-profile incumbents, including Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York; Greg Abbott, Republican of Texas; and Tony Evers, Democrat of Wisconsin.
Ballot initiatives: Voters in Michigan approved making abortion access a right protected under the State Constitution. Those in Maryland and Missouri voted to legalize marijuana, though similar measures were rejected in Arkansas and North Dakota.
A rough night for Donald Trump: Several candidates that he endorsed, including in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, lost or were behind. And a potential rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, handily won re-election.

Facebook’s owner Meta will lay off 11,000 employees, equivalent to 13 percent of its work force, the company announced on Wednesday morning, in the biggest restructuring in the social media giant’s history. A slump in digital advertising and ballooning losses from its pivot to the metaverse have pushed the company to make a series of wide-ranging cuts.
In a note to employees, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s co-founder and C.E.O., admitted that the company had hired too aggressively during the pandemic as homebound consumers spent more time socializing and shopping online. Meta mistakenly assumed this trend would continue: “I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,” he wrote.
The company has begun cutting costs across its operations, “scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint,” Zuckerberg wrote. The stock was up 3.7 percent in premarket trading, outperforming the Nasdaq.
The economic downturn is forcing companies across industries to shrink. Citigroup and Barclays are expected to lay off hundreds in their investment banking units, Bloomberg reports. And, according to Protocol, Salesforce could cut as many as 2,500 positions in the coming weeks as the activist investor Starboard Value seeks big changes in corporate strategy.

Exclusive: Keurig Dr Pepper buys stake in Athletic Brewing
Keurig Dr Pepper has invested $50 million in Athletic Brewing, the nonalcoholic beer company, as part of a $75 million fund-raise by Athletic, DealBook is first to report. It’s the beverage giant’s second foray into the nonalcoholic booze category — it announced a deal to acquire a nonalcoholic cocktail brand called Atypique this summer — and another sign of interest in this fast-growing category.
Athletic Brewing was founded in 2017 by Bill Shufelt, a former trader at the hedge fund Point72, and John Walker, a former craft brewer. It now sells its products — including lager, light beer and sparkling water — at retailers like Trader Joe’s. With its new backer, Athletic is looking to expand in Australia, France and Spain.
Sales of nonalcoholic beer are skyrocketing, growing almost 70 percent between 2016 and 2021 in the U.S., to about $670 million, according to Euromonitor. While that is still a tiny portion of the overall beer market, its popularity stands in stark contrast to overall sluggishness in beer sales, as the younger generation drinks less and cares more about its waistline. Beer giants like Heineken, Budweiser and Sam Adams have released nonalcoholic alternatives in the last five years.
It’s not just for recovering alcoholics or nondrinkers. Shufelt said 80 percent of his customers drink alcohol, and three-fourths are between the ages of 21 and 44. About half are women, he added.

1. Inflation cooled more than expected, in welcome news for the Fed and President Biden.
Consumer prices rose 7.7 percent in the year through October, according to data released today. The figure is 0.2 percent lower than what analysts had projected and down from the 8.2 percent increase recorded in the year through September. Some saw this as evidence that the Federal Reserve’s campaign to tame inflation was working.
The data offered evidence of a meaningful slowdown: On a monthly basis, “core” inflation, which strips out food and fuel, showed prices climbing just 0.3 percent between September and October, the slowest rise since September 2021. Stocks rallied on the news: The S&P 500 rose 5.5 percent on the day, its best single-day performance since April 2020.

Polls suggested that inflation would play a decisive role in the midterm elections. But after Democrats appeared to overcome economic headwinds, President Biden said he would not change his economic approach. Wall Street, for its part, tends to like a divided government.

2. Control of the House rests on a knife’s edge as the Senate focus shifts to Georgia.
Roughly 48 hours after election polls began closing, more than 30 House races remained uncalled, with a narrow majority in reach for both parties. Republicans have won or are leading in 221 districts — three more than the number needed to retake the chamber — but Democrats remain fewer than 5,000 votes behind in four races.

Control of the Senate will likely take longer to determine than that of the House. In Nevada, where Adam Laxalt, a Republican, narrowly leads the incumbent Democrat, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, election officials will announce a final vote count next week. In Arizona, Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat, has maintained a lead over Blake Masters.
And in Georgia, Senator Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, are heading back on the campaign trail before a runoff on Dec. 6.

3. Both parties try to dissect how Democrats defied conventional political wisdom.
Many Democrats worried that their messages on the economy and crime did not adequately address voter anxieties. But two issues helped them pull away with unexpected victories: abortion and democracy. In states where the issues were central, Democrats outperformed expectations, despite a less-than-popular president.

4. The top U.S. general suggests that it may be time for peace talks in Ukraine.
Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that more than 200,000 Russian and Ukrainian troops had been killed or wounded during the war in Ukraine — more than 100,000 on each side — in addition to roughly 40,000 Ukrainian civilians.
Milley added that the coming winter months, when a lull in fighting is expected, could be an opportunity for both sides to consider peace talks. However, the prevailing U.S. and European opinion is that the two countries are far from such negotiations.

5. Biden is flying to Egypt tonight to address the U.N. climate summit. His message may not be what the world is looking for.
Though Biden is expected to hail his major new climate law in his address tomorrow, he may not have a receptive audience: Developing nations have spent all week excoriating industrialized nations for causing climate change, and demanding reparations.

Ukraine moves forward in south
The Ukrainian Army is moving cautiously into areas abandoned by Russian troops along a front line in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, a day after Russia’s defense minister announced a retreat from the western bank of the Dnipro River. The move marked a significant setback for Russia’s military; in September it declared parts of the region Russian land.
Heavy fighting continues in some places, but the Ukrainian advance into Snihurivka, an important hub north of Kherson City that was abandoned overnight, indicates that the Russians are, indeed, retreating. Ukrainian officials had initially feared a ruse in the Russian announcement of a pullback, which followed days of enigmatic declarations from the occupying authorities.
Ukraine’s military yesterday said it had advanced into 100 square miles of land in the past 24 hours and had reclaimed 12 towns and villages. “The enemy is regrouping and taking measures to partially withdraw troops to the left bank of the Dnipro,” the military said in a statement, referring to the river’s eastern bank, where the Russian military has been building defenses.
International pressure: A disagreement has emerged at the highest levels of the U.S. government over whether to press Ukraine to seek a diplomatic end to the war, with America’s top general urging negotiations, while other advisers to President Biden argue that it is too soon.

Emissions set to rise year-over-year
Global fossil fuel emissions will most likely reach record highs in 2022 and do not yet show signs of declining, researchers said. Nations are projected to emit roughly 36.6 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide by burning coal, natural gas and oil for energy, up 1 percent from 2021 and slightly more than the previous record in 2019.
The findings were released this week at the U.N. climate change summit in Egypt. Scientists have warned that the world as a whole will need to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by around midcentury to stabilize global temperatures and minimize the risks from deadly heat waves, sea-level rise and ecosystem collapse.
A few countries account for the majority of the world’s fossil fuel emissions, with China responsible for 32 percent, the U.S. 14 percent, the E.U. 8 percent and India 8 percent. In Europe, emissions are expected to drop by about 0.8 percent this year, largely driven by a steep fall in natural gas consumption after Russia cut off supplies.

Analysis: “Every year that emissions go up makes it that much more challenging to bring them back down again by a certain date,” said Glen Peters, a research director at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, who is one of more than 100 scientists involved in the research.

Fresh questions for France’s far right
Grégoire de Fournas, a member of France’s National Assembly from the far-right National Rally, received the harshest possible penalty after interrupting a Black colleague’s speech about shipwrecked migrants in the Mediterranean by shouting, “Back to Africa!”
Whether the target of the outburst last week was his colleague, Carlos Martens Bilongo, or the boat carrying the migrants is in dispute. But the remark, which the body’s president determined to be racist no matter whom it was referring to, has highlighted ongoing issues for the National Rally, as the nationalist party seeks to sanitize its image.

The National Rally, now France’s largest opposition party, has for years attempted to move beyond its narrow anti-immigrant appeals and break out of the fringes of French politics. That effort had mostly been working. But this episode violated strict internal orders to its members to “behave irreproachably” in Parliament, where they have tried hard to blend in.
Context: The party’s rising profile fits a broader trend of hard-right parties gaining power in Europe. In Sweden, an anti-immigrant party now has a say over government policies, while in Italy, a nationalist party leads the government.

‘The Crown’ returns to a changed Britain
The fifth season of “The Crown,” the Netflix series about British royals, has been released at a pivotal moment for the monarchy and for Britain. Queen Elizabeth II died two months ago, and weeks of political and economic tumult this fall led to the downfall of Liz Truss and the ascent of Rishi Sunak, the country’s third prime minister since July.

Now, Britain is divided over how the show, which returned this week, depicts the queen and the country’s thorny recent history.
Several prominent figures who are depicted in the show, including the former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major, have publicly denounced the season. The actress Judi Dench said the series was, at times, “cruelly unjust to the individuals and damaging to the institution they represent” and suggested a disclaimer be added to every episode.
“The series is now depicting events that many people in Britain lived through and can remember,” Sarah Lyall, a former London correspondent for The Times, said. “The question of how ‘true’ it all is has become a much more resonant issue.”

2022-11-12,"BALI, Indonesia — Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen on Saturday called for stabilizing the United States’ rocky relationship with China and reopening regular lines of communication between the world’s two largest economies ahead of a global gathering next week where their leaders are expected to meet.
Ms. Yellen’s comments came as she prepared to meet with Yi Gang, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the Group of 20 leaders summit on Monday in Bali, where President Biden is expected to meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. It will be the first in-person meeting between Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi since the president took office last year, a period in which ties between the nations further deteriorated.
“I think stabilizing the relationship and trying to get it on a better footing while recognizing that we have a whole range of concerns, and we would like to address those,” Ms. Yellen said on Saturday in an interview with The New York Times aboard her flight to Indonesia when asked how the relationship could be improved.
America’s relationship with China frayed considerably during the Trump administration, when President Donald J. Trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese imports. Soon after a deal to end the impasse was struck in late 2019, the coronavirus started to spread around the world and Mr. Trump blamed China for its emergence.
Despite the Biden administration’s less outwardly confrontational tone, relations with China have worsened in the past two years. The White House in October unveiled sweeping export restrictions to block China from gaining access to critical technology on national security grounds, and it has declined to roll back the remaining tariffs that were enacted by Mr. Trump.
Hostilities were inflamed this year when Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan amid concern in the United States that China was planning to forcibly reclaim the island, which operates independently. China insists that Taiwan is part of its territory and cannot exist as a sovereign nation.

2022-11-13,"Joel Gindo thought he could finally own and operate the farm of his dreams when a neighbor put up 160 acres of cropland for sale in Brookings County, S.D., two years ago. Five thousand or six thousand dollars an acre should do the trick, Mr. Gindo estimated.
But at auction, Mr. Gindo watched helplessly as the price continued to climb until it hit $11,000 an acre, double what he had budgeted for.
“I just couldn’t compete with how much people are paying, with people paying 10 grand,” he said. “And for someone like me who doesn’t have an inheritance somewhere sitting around, a lump sum of money sitting around, everything has to be financed.”
What is happening in South Dakota is playing out in farming communities across the nation as the value of farmland soars, hitting record highs this year and often pricing out small or beginning farmers. In the state, farmland values surged by 18.7 percent from 2021 to 2022, one of the highest increases in the country, according to the most recent figures from the Agriculture Department. Nationwide, values increased by 12.4 percent and reached $3,800 an acre, the highest on record since 1970, with cropland at $5,050 an acre and pastureland at $1,650 an acre.

A series of economic forces — high prices for commodity crops like corn, soybeans and wheat; a robust housing market; low interest rates until recently; and an abundance of government subsidies — have converged to create a “perfect storm” for farmland values, said Jason Henderson, a dean at the College of Agriculture at Purdue University and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
As a result, small farmers like Mr. Gindo are now going up against deep-pocketed investors, including private equity firms and real estate developers, prompting some experts to warn of far-reaching consequences for the farming sector.

Young farmers named finding affordable land for purchase the top challenge in 2022 in a September survey by the National Young Farmers Coalition, a nonprofit group.
Already, the supply of land is limited. About 40 percent of farmland in the United States is rented, most of it owned by landlords who are not actively involved in farming. And the amount of land available for purchase is extremely scant, with less than 1 percent of farmland sold on the open market annually.

The booming housing market, among a number of factors, has bolstered the value of farmland, particularly in areas close to growing city centers.
“What we have seen over the past year or two was, when housing starts to go up with new building construction, that puts pressure on farmland, especially on those urban fringes,” Professor Henderson explained. “And that leads to a cascading ripple effect into land values even farther and farther away.”
Government subsidies to farmers have also soared in recent years, amounting to nearly 39 percent of net farm income in 2020. On top of traditional programs like crop insurance payments, the Agriculture Department distributed $23 billion to farmers hurt by President Donald J. Trump’s trade war from 2018 to 2020 and $45.3 billion in pandemic-related assistance in 2020 and 2021. (The government’s contribution to farm income decreased to 20 percent in 2021 and is forecast to be about 8 percent in 2022.)
Those payments, or even the very promise of additional assistance, increase farmland values as they create a safety net and signal that agricultural land is a safe bet, research shows.
“There’s an expectation in the market that the government’s going to play a role when farm incomes drop, so that definitely affects investment behavior,” said Jennifer Ifft, a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University.

Eager investors are increasingly turning to farmland in the face of volatility in the stock and real estate markets. Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and a billionaire, is the biggest private farmland owner in the country and recently won approval to buy 2,100 acres in North Dakota for $13.5 million.
The number of private equity funds seeking to buy stakes in farmland has ticked higher, said Tim Koch, a vice president at an agricultural financial cooperative in the Midwest, Farm Credit Services of America. Pension funds also consider farmland a stable investment, Professor Ifft said.

Farmers, too, have witnessed an influx of outside interest. Nathaniel Bankhead, who runs a farm and garden consulting business in Chattanooga, Tenn., has banded with a group of other agricultural workers to save up to $500,000 to buy about 60 acres of land. For months, the collective has been repeatedly outbid by real estate developers, investors looking to diversify their portfolios and urban transplants with “delusional agrarian dreams,” he said.

“Places that I have looked at as potential farmland are being bought up in cash before I can even go through the process that a working-class person has to do to access land,” he said. “And the ironic thing is, those are my clients, like I get hired by them to do as a hobby what I’m trying to do as a livelihood. So it’s tough to watch.”
Mr. Bankhead characterized the current landscape as a form of “digital feudalism” for aspiring working farmers. Wealthy landowners drive up land prices, contract with agricultural designers like himself to enact their vision and then hire a caretaker to work the land — pricing out those very employees from becoming owners themselves.
“They kind of lock that person to this new flavor of serfdom where it’s, you might be decently paid, you’ve got access to it, but it will never be yours,” he said.

When she sought to expand her farm and buy her own land, she quickly found that prices were out of reach, with real estate developers driving up land values and pushing out agriculture producers.

A five-acre property in the Redlands now costs $500,000 to $700,000, Ms. Trujillo said. “So I essentially didn’t have a choice but to leave Miami and Florida as a whole.”
“Farming is a very stressful profession,” she added. “When you throw in land insecurity, it makes it 20 times worse. So there were many, many times where I thought: ‘Oh my God. I’m not going to be able to do this. This isn’t feasible.’”
As small and beginning farmers are shut out — the latest agricultural census said that the average age of farmers inched up to 57.5 — the prohibitively high land values may have ripple effects on the sector at large.
Brian Philpot, the chief executive of AgAmerica, an agricultural lending institution, said his firm’s average loan size had increased as farms consolidated, squeezing out family farms. This, he argued, could lead to a farm crisis.

“Do we have the skills and the next generation of people to farm it? And two, if the answer is going to be, we’re going to have passive owners own this land and lease it out, is that very sustainable?” he said.
Professor Henderson also warned that current farmers may face increased financial risk as they seek to leverage their high farmland values, essentially betting the farm to expand it.
“They’ll buy more land but they’ll use debt to do it,” he said. “They’ll stretch themselves out.”
Economists and lenders said farmland values appeared to have plateaued in recent months, as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and the cost of fertilizer and diesel soared. But with high commodity prices forecast for next year, some believe values will remain high.

A native of Tanzania who moved to South Dakota about a decade ago, Mr. Gindo bought seven acres of land to raise livestock in 2019 and currently rents an additional 40 acres to grow corn and soybeans — all the while working full time as a comptroller to make ends meet.
For now, he has cooled off his search for a farm of his own even as he dreams of passing on that land to his son. The more immediate concern, he said, was whether his landlord would raise his rent. So far, the landlord has refrained because Mr. Gindo helps him out around the farm.
“He really doesn’t have to lend me his land,” Mr. Gindo said. “He can make double that with someone else.”
In Florida, Ms. Trujillo said, the owner of the land where her brother-in-law’s nursery sits has spoken of selling the plot while prices remain high, so he too has begun looking for his own property.
“That’s a big fear for a lot of these farmers and nursery owners who are renting land, because you just never know when the owner’s just going to say: ‘You know what? This year, I’m selling and you’ve got to go,’” she said.

In Tennessee, Mr. Bankhead said he considered giving up on owning a farm “multiple times a day” as friends who have been longtime farmers leave the profession.
But so far, he remains committed to staying in the field and doing “the work of trying to keep land in families’ hands and showing there’s more to do with this land than to sell it to real estate developers,” he said. “But the pain of not having my own garden and not being able to have my animals where I live, it never stings any less.”

2022-11-14,"Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, said he would give away most of his money to charity, making him the latest billionaire to pledge to donate his vast fortune during his lifetime.
Mr. Bezos is the world’s fourth-richest person, worth $124 billion, according to Bloomberg. In an interview with CNN released on Monday, Mr. Bezos, appearing with his girlfriend, the former television anchor Lauren Sanchez, said they were making preparations “to be able to give away this money.”
He said he wanted to give in a way that maximized the impact of the donations. “It’s really hard,” he said. “And there are a bunch of ways, I think, that you could do ineffective things.”
It was the first time that Mr. Bezos announced that he would give away the bulk of his wealth. More than 230 of the richest people in the world have promised to donate their money to charitable causes as part of the Giving Pledge, a philanthropy movement started in 2010.

At least as far back as the 19th-century financier George Peabody, many ultrawealthy Americans have given away large shares of their fortunes. Andrew Carnegie famously wrote in his influential 1889 treatise, “The Gospel of Wealth,” that “the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.” Like Mr. Bezos at Amazon, Carnegie was frequently criticized for the labor conditions at his company.
The New York Times reported on Monday that Amazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company’s history. Mr. Bezos’ wealth, which as recently as last year was more than $200 billion, according to Bloomberg, has fallen by tens of billions, on paper, because it is closely tied to Amazon’s share price, which has suffered along with other technology stocks this year.
Mr. Bezos, who is the executive chairman of Amazon, stepped down as chief executive in 2021 when he said his goal was “have the time and energy” to focus on his philanthropy and other pursuits. Mr. Bezos also owns The Washington Post and has his own space travel company, Blue Origin.
On Saturday, Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez announced a $100 million grant for the singer and philanthropist Dolly Parton to direct to her chosen charitable causes, as part of an annual gift called the Bezos Award for Courage and Civility. Before Ms. Parton, $100 million awards were given to the chef José Andrés and the CNN commentator and activist Van Jones, announced by Mr. Bezos at the news conference after his trip in July 2021 aboard a rocket sent to outer space by Blue Origin.
In 2020, Mr. Bezos pledged to give $10 billion to combat climate change as part of the Bezos Earth Fund. As part of that commitment, Mr. Bezos pledged $2 billion to restore natural habitats and transform food systems at the climate summit in Glasgow last year. Previously, Mr. Bezos’ largest donation was a $2 billion gift to help homeless families and start preschools.

Mr. Bezos did not give many details in the CNN interview about how he would donate money, but his past efforts might provide some clues, said Stacy Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
“This is a giant statement, not just because of the amount of wealth he has, but because he might really have a ripple effect on what others choose to do,” Ms. Palmer said.
But Mr. Bezos’ comment about giving away his fortune was “not a binding promise,” said Maribel Morey, a philanthropy expert and founding executive director of the Miami Institute for the Social Sciences. “We run to make news of promises, but we actually don’t know if that’s going to materialize.”
In 1999, the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife at the time, Melinda French Gates, helped usher in a new era of billionaire philanthropy with enormous donations to their namesake foundation. Their close friend Warren E. Buffett, the prominent investor, announced in 2006 that he would give a significant slice of his Berkshire Hathaway shares, valued at the time at $31 billion, to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The three then started the Giving Pledge, where billionaires promise to give away at least half their fortunes, as a way to encourage greater generosity among the world’s richest people.
Other signatories have included Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor of New York; Mr. Gates’s Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen; and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan. There are 236 pledgers across 28 countries, according to the Giving Pledge’s website.

Mr. Bezos has been criticized for not signing the Giving Pledge. His ex-wife, the author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, signed the pledge in 2019 after their divorce, vowing to “keep at it until the safe is empty.”
Ms. Scott, who is estimated by Bloomberg to be worth $24 billion, has already met the Giving Pledge threshold by giving away more than half her fortune — and she has done it in less than three and half years since first publishing her promise on the group’s website.
She has donated more than $14 billion to causes ranging from education to mental health. Ms. Scott, who recently filed for divorce from her second husband, has given to more than 1,500 groups.
Ms. Scott’s rapid, prolific giving is at times compared with Mr. Bezos’ own philanthropy, often to his detriment. Last month, Mr. Bezos visited the Vatican to receive a philanthropy award even though, many observers noted, his ex-wife had given away more money than he had. Unlike Mr. Bezos, who appears at events and gives speeches highlighting his giving, Ms. Scott has maintained a low profile, refusing all interviews on the subject and restricting her comments to essays that she posts on the website Medium.
On Monday, Ms. Scott released her latest essay, noting that over the past seven months she had given nearly $2 billion to 343 organizations. Some of those gifts, like $122.6 million to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, had been previously announced. Others, like a $15 million gift to the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, were first revealed in the post. Like many of her gifts, the donation to the 83-year-old nonprofit group, which supports refugees and migrants entering the United States, was the largest in its history.
Ms. Scott began her latest essay with a poem by Gwen Nell Westerman that she said “inspires me by shutting me up every time I read it.”"
2022-11-15,"Disheveled, young and exceedingly brainy, Sam Bankman-Fried perfectly fit the role of a Silicon Valley mogul in the making. Mr. Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, leaned into the Silicon Valley stereotype and then some, playing video games while pitching investors and wearing a T-shirt and shorts onstage with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Blue-chip investors fell for his persona, and Mr. Bankman-Fried profited greatly, with his estimated net worth reaching over $26 billion at one point.
That net worth is now close to zero. In last week’s sudden collapse of FTX — which nine months ago was the star of a Larry David Super Bowl ad — billions evaporated as revelations emerged of questionable transfers between FTX and Alameda Research, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s trading company. Law enforcement is now investigating, which could lead to criminal charges.
We’ve seen this movie before: A casually attired whiz kid emerging from seemingly nowhere is proclaimed both savant and savior, and takes the world by storm. Growing concern about Big Tech’s power and intense criticism of onetime wunderkinds like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos set the stage perfectly for a figure like Mr. Bankman-Fried. Amid power-hungry moguls and crypto hustlers, here was a white-knight superhero in the perfect costume, championing philanthropy and pledging to make the world a better place — for real, this time.
But even Mr. Bankman-Fried’s collapse probably won’t kill the whiz kid archetype. This all-American notion has fueled some spectacular meltdowns but also scored big wins. The willingness of U.S. investors and customers to take bets on the young, untested and brainy has delivered world-transforming innovations and companies — a computer on every desk, a smartphone in every hand.

But the whiz kid fixation also reflects a less healthy societal tendency to overstate the importance of individual “genius” and gloss over other things critical to any whiz kid’s success — especially connections, timing and luck. It also devalues experience and maturity. We invest so much in the ideal that it excludes those who don’t fit the part and places too much faith in those who do.
Silicon Valley’s whiz kids owe their mythology to America’s very beginnings. Ben Franklin, who conducted electrical experiments in lightning storms in the 1750s, shocked the bewigged and bejeweled French court in the 1770s by arriving in a homespun coat and frontiersman’s fur cap. Thomas Jefferson, Virginia planter and perpetually tinkering inventor, padded around the White House wearing the early 1800s version of work-from-home sweatpants.
Their get-ups deliberately sent a message to their fellow citizens and to European rulers: Americans were democratic, humble and uninterested in dressing to show off their wealth. They were too busy working and inventing to bother.
The Great Inventor himself, Thomas Edison, holder of over 1,000 patents, cannily cultivated an eccentric-genius reputation. At the peak of his fame in the 1870s and 1880s, Edison wore rumpled suits and played pranks using dangerous chemicals on co-workers. Admirers pointed to these quirks as further signs of his brilliance.
And while Edison had detractors, he was never as controversial as the railroad barons, steel kings and financiers whose sharp-elbowed and sometimes fraudulent dealings drove the boom-and-bust Gilded Age economy.

The whiz kid myth lay largely dormant until the 1970s, when the buttoned-up business type was under siege and once unassailable American brands were being battered by oil shocks, stagflation and foreign competition. Enter Steve Jobs of Apple and Bill Gates of Microsoft: impossibly young, tousle-haired, looking nothing like typical business executives. A venture capitalist who visited Apple’s first headquarters — in Mr. Jobs’s parents’ suburban garage — quipped that the wispy-bearded entrepreneur and his business partner, Steve Wozniak, looked like “renegades from the human race.”
Freckled and slight, Mr. Gates looked more like a teenager and could behave that way as well. “At times during an interview he slumped so far in his chair as to be almost prone,” a Seattle Times reporter wrote in 1982. Microsoft’s other co-founder, Paul Allen, was “a large, heavily bearded, mild-mannered man who wore a rumpled corduroy sports jacket.” To become a tech millionaire, it seems, you need to avoid using an iron.
Then the dot-com boom took the stereotype into hyperdrive, largely because being a tech whiz kid now meant becoming really, really rich. “The Golden Geeks,” exclaimed a headline on the cover of Time magazine in early 1996 featuring Marc Andreessen, the 24-year-old co-founder of Netscape, sitting (barefoot, of course) on a gilded throne.
The dot-com bust tanked companies and investment portfolios. Instead of dispensing with the whiz kid model, however, Silicon Valley doubled down. Venture capitalists lost money when the bubble burst, but they were still far wealthier than before the boom, and they knew that the internet age was only getting started.
Out of another garage came Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, who took that brand of iconoclasm and scaled it up to an entire enterprise. Six years later, in 2004, out of a Harvard dorm room, came Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook — similarly single-minded and geeky, readily posing barefoot, making the hoodie into a shorthand signal for business genius.

As the tech world and its group of golden geeks got larger, wealthier and ever more dominant, one thing stayed the same. The whiz kids were, almost exclusively, male, white and young. Women could never get away with being such slobs.
They could, however, dress the part in other ways. Less than a decade ago, the Theranos C.E.O., Elizabeth Holmes, seized the public’s imagination by wearing Steve Jobs-style black turtlenecks and professing a single-minded devotion to changing the world. She had a seemingly monastic routine, an awkward affect and an unvarying wardrobe — like Mr. Zuckerberg, she explained that she wore the same thing every day to avoid having to make one more decision. All these things had become so strongly associated with successful tech founders that they served as proxies for her credibility.
Revelations that Theranos’s vaunted blood-testing technology didn’t work led to Ms. Holmes being tried and convicted of criminal fraud. Last week, she was denied a retrial and will soon be sentenced. The downfall of “the female Steve Jobs” may have made it even more difficult for women and other underrepresented entrepreneurs to obtain funding.
We are waiting to learn whether Mr. Bankman-Fried’s actions crossed the line from questionable to fraudulent. But the fact that the rocketing rise and sudden tumble of him and Ms. Holmes — magnetic, charismatic and remarkably good at getting rich people to give them money — occurred so close together should serve as a warning.
It is not surprising that a nation born from the overthrow of hereditary wealth has long celebrated self-made inventors who forge an independent path. But the startling fall of Sam Bankman-Fried is a good moment to reflect on the perils of placing so much money, faith and power in the hands of a few golden geeks.

The word inculcation has appeared in four articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Jan. 7 in the Opinion essay “How to Go From Homelessness to Venture Capital” by Peter Coy:
… Year Up costs a lot because it aims high. It takes young men and women who are at risk of being stuck at the bottom and puts them on a path to the middle class. Cutting back too much on the coaching and mentoring that students get could render it ineffective. “We’re putting a huge amount of time and effort into holding what we know works, the special sauce, but innovating new models that are faster, that require less philanthropy per student,” Chertavian said.
One solution that Year Up is experimenting with is to outsource the teaching of hard skills — such as proficiency in Microsoft Office — and focus on the “special sauce,” which is Year Up’s inculcation of soft skills such as showing up on time, meeting deadlines and working in teams. The sorts of things students learn, Chertavian said, are: “How do you make small talk when you’re in the elevator with someone? What does proactivity look like? What does it mean to take initiative?”

Sometime in May 2020, Payton Gendron, a 16-year-old in upstate New York, was browsing the website 4chan when he came across a GIF.
It was taken from a livestream recording made the previous year by a gunman as he killed 51 people and wounded more than 40 others at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The killer had written a manifesto explaining that he was motivated by the fear of great replacement theory, the racist belief that secretive forces are importing nonwhite people to dilute countries’ white majorities.
Seeing the video and the manifesto “started my real research into the problems with immigration and foreigners in our white lands — without his livestream I would likely have no idea about the real problems the West is facing,” Mr. Gendron wrote in his own manifesto, posted on the internet shortly before, officials say, he drove to a Tops grocery store in Buffalo and carried out a massacre of his own that left 10 Black people dead.
The authorities say Mr. Gendron’s attack in May mimicked the massacre in Christchurch not just in its motivation but also in tactics. He reduced his caloric intake and cataloged his diet to prepare physically, as the Christchurch killer did. He practiced shooting. He wrote slogans on his rifle, as the Christchurch gunman did. He livestreamed his attack with a GoPro camera attached to his helmet, with the idea of inspiring other attacks by fellow extremists. Mr. Gendron’s screed ran to 180 pages, with 23 percent of those pages copied word-for-word from the Christchurch killer’s manifesto, according to an investigative report on the attacks released last month by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James.

On the day of the shooting, State Senator James Sanders echoed the horrified response of many: “Although this is probably a lone-wolf incident, this is not the first mass shooting we have seen, and sadly it will not be the last,” he said.
It’s unfortunate that the term “lone wolf” has come into such casual use in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks. It aims to describe a person — nearly always a man — who is radicalized to violence but unconnected to an organized terrorist group like Al Qaeda. But it is wrong to think about violent white supremacists as isolated actors."

None of Anthony Kline’s colleagues had ever seen it happen. The most senior justice on California’s First District Court of Appeal, Kline was asking to be transferred to the juvenile bench, at the advanced age of 83. Juvenile was the scrappy place you started a career, not the triumphant place you ended one. But after four decades in appeals, Kline was feeling estranged from real life. He wanted to spend a year in juvie before retiring.
The First District was in a Beaux-Arts building next to San Francisco’s City Hall, with stone archways framed by lanterns. The juvenile court occupied a rundown 1950s building on Woodside Avenue next to a gas station, high on an isolated hill. Kline’s new courtroom was on the ground floor and had wood-laminate walls, hulking silver air-conditioners and mismatched office chairs. Forty years earlier, in 1981, he spent a year presiding over this same courtroom — one of his first judicial assignments.
Before arriving back at Woodside, Kline was given a one-week training course, meant for judges who were starting in juvenile for the first time. In a way, he was. Juvie had softened in the intervening years. In the 1980s, juvenile judges tended to track minors into detention, but today, the instructor explained, juvenile judges try to divert defendants into drug treatment, mental-health counseling or family therapy. A progressive throughout his career, Kline thought the changes were an enormous improvement.
On Kline’s docket, the cases looked like the ones he confronted 40 years earlier. Foster kids accused of stealing cars. Eighth graders caught in school with knives. A 15-year-old from the Potrero Hill projects who had somehow gotten his hands on a high-capacity weapon. If Kline had been looking for real life, he found it. The downstairs courtroom of Woodside Avenue was about as far from the abstract world of the appeals court as you could get.
Five weeks into his new role, Kline learned about a case coming his way, one in which the defendant was not a minor at all. She was a 58-year-old woman. When Kline sought an explanation, he learned that California had recently passed a bill to help reduce the state’s prison population through resentencing. Now, an inmate serving an inordinately long sentence for a crime committed as a minor could return to juvenile court and have the case reconsidered, once, by a juvenile judge. The defendant coming to Kline had served 41 years for a crime she committed at 17. Her name was Jamesetta Guy.
Kline recognized it. In 1981, during his year in juvenile court, he presided over the trial of a 15-year-old girl named Sharon Wright, who had participated in a botched robbery attempt in which a taxi driver was shot and killed. In the taxi with Wright there had been another girl: Jamesetta Guy. Kline sentenced Wright to eight years in juvenile custody, but he never learned what happened to Guy. Now he had the answer. Forty-one years. A staggering term, especially for someone convicted as a minor. Some adults with the same conviction would have paroled out 20 years ago. What led to this sentence, Kline saw, was almost everything that could go wrong for a juvenile defendant. She had no criminal history; the gun wasn’t hers; she grew up in a violently abusive home. The evidence didn’t show premeditated murder. And yet a judge in 1981 declared her “unfit” to be tried as a juvenile and tracked her into the adult system. By the time her name appeared on Kline’s calendar in 2022, Guy had been in prison as long as he had been a judge.

2022-11-28,"In the weeks since Elon Musk took over Twitter, dozens of people responsible for keeping dangerous or inaccurate material in check on the service have posted on LinkedIn that they resigned or lost their jobs. Their statements have drawn a flood of condolences — and attempts to recruit them.
Overtures arrived from rival tech services, retailers, consulting firms, government contractors and other organizations that want to use the former Twitter employees — and those recently let go by Meta and the payments platform Stripe — to track and combat false and toxic information on the internet.
Ania Smith, the chief executive of TaskRabbit, the Ikea-owned marketplace for gig workers, commented on a former Twitter employee’s post this month that he should consider applying for a product director role, working in part on trust and safety tools.
“The war for talent has really been exceptional in the last 24 months in tech,” Ms. Smith said in an interview. “So when we see layoffs happening, whether it’s at Twitter or Meta or other companies, it’s definitely an opportunity to go after some of the very high-caliber talent we know they hire.”

She added that making users feel safe on the TaskRabbit platform was a key component of her company’s success.
“We can’t really continue growing without investing in a trust and safety team,” she said.
The threats posed by conspiracy theories, misleadingly manipulated media, hate speech, child abuse, fraud and other online harms have been studied for years by academic researchers, think tanks and government analysts. But increasingly, companies in and outside the tech industry see that abuse as a potentially expensive liability, especially as more work is conducted online and regulators and clients push for stronger guardrails.
On LinkedIn, under posts eulogizing Twitter’s work on elections and content moderation, comments promoted openings at TikTok (threat researcher), DoorDash (community policy manager) and Twitch (trust and safety incident manager). Managers at other companies solicited suggestions for names to add to recruiting databases. Google, Reddit, Microsoft, Discord and ActiveFence — a four-year-old company that said last year that it had raised $100 million and that it could scan more than three million sources of malicious chatter in every language — also have job postings.

The trust and safety field barely existed a decade ago, and the talent pool is still small, said Lisa Kaplan, the founder of Alethea, a company that uses early-detection technology to help clients protect against disinformation campaigns. The three-year-old company has 35 employees; Ms. Kaplan said she hoped to add 23 more by mid-2023 and was trying to recruit former Twitter employees.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Disinformation, she said, is like “the new malware” — a “digital reality that is ultimately going to impact every company.” Clients that once employed armed guards to stand outside data rooms, and then built online firewalls to block hackers, are now calling firms like Alethea for backup when, for example, coordinated influence campaigns target public perception of their brand and threaten their stock price, Ms. Kaplan said.
“Anyone can do this — it’s fast, cheap and easy,” she said. “As more actors get into the practice of weaponizing information, either for financial, reputational, political or ideological gain, you’re going to see more targets. This market is emerging because the threat has risen and the consequences have become more real.”
Disinformation became widely recognized as a significant problem in 2016, said John Kelly, who was an academic researcher at Columbia, Harvard and Oxford before founding Graphika, a social media analysis firm, in 2013. The company’s employees are known as “the cartographers of the internet age” for their work building detailed maps of social media for clients such as Pinterest and Meta.
Graphika's focus, initially on mining digital marketing insights, has steadily shifted toward topics such as disinformation campaigns coordinated by foreigners, extremist narratives and climate misinformation. The transition, which began in 2016 with the discovery of Russian influence operations targeting the U.S. presidential election, intensified with the onslaught of Covid-19 conspiracy theories during the pandemic, Mr. Kelly said.

“The problems have spilled out of the political arena and become a Fortune 500 problem,” he said. “The range of online harms has expanded, and the range of people doing the online harm has expanded.”

Efforts to tackle misinformation and disinformation have included research initiatives from top-tier universities and policy institutes, media literacy campaigns and initiatives to repopulate news deserts with local journalism outfits.
Many social media platforms have set up internal teams to address the problem or outsourced content moderation work to large companies such as Accenture, according to a July report from the geopolitical think tank German Marshall Fund. In September, Google completed its $5.4 billion acquisition of Mandiant, an 18-year-old company that tracks online influence activities as well as offering other cybersecurity services.
A growing group of start-ups, many of which rely on artificial intelligence to root out and decode online narratives, conduct similar exercises, often for clients in corporate America.
Alethea wrapped up a $10 million fund-raising round in October. Also last month, Spotify said it bought the five-year-old Irish company Kinzen, citing its grasp on “the complexity of analyzing audio content in hundreds of languages and dialects, and the challenges in effectively evaluating the nuance and intent of that content.” (Months earlier, Spotify found itself trying to quell an uproar over accusations that its star podcast host, Joe Rogan, was spreading vaccine misinformation.) Amazon’s Alexa Fund participated in a $24 million funding round last winter for five-year-old Logically, which uses artificial intelligence to identify misinformation and disinformation on topics such as climate change and Covid-19.

“Along with all the fantastic aspects of the web come new problems like bias, misinformation and offensive content to name a few,” Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, wrote on a crowdfunding page last year for Factmata, another A.I.-fueled disinformation defense operation. “It can be confusing and difficult to cut through to the trusted, truthful information.”

The businesses are hiring across a broad spectrum of trust and safety roles despite a host of recent layoff announcements.
Companies have courted people expert at recognizing content posted by child abusers or human traffickers, as well as former military counterterrorism agents with advanced degrees in law, political science and engineering. Moderators, many of whom work as contractors, are also in demand.
Mounir Ibrahim, the vice president of public affairs and impact for Truepic, a tech company specializing in image and digital content authenticity, said many early clients were banks and insurance companies that relied more and more on digital transactions.

“We are at an inflection point of the modern internet right now,” he said. “We are facing a tsunami of generative and synthetic material that is going to hit our computer screens very, very soon — not just images and videos, but text, code, audio, everything under the sun. And this is going to have tremendous effects on not just disinformation but brand integrity, the financial tech world, on the insurance world and across nearly every vertical that is now digitally transforming on the heels of Covid.”
Truepic was featured with companies such as Zignal Labs and Memetica in the German Marshall Fund report about disinformation-defense start-ups. Anya Schiffrin, the lead author and a senior lecturer at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, said future regulation of disinformation and other malicious content could lead to more jobs in the trust and safety space.
She said regulators around the European Union were already hiring people to help carry out the new Digital Services Act, which requires internet platforms to combat misinformation and restrict certain online ads.
“I’m really tired of these really rich companies saying that it’s too expensive — it’s a cost of doing business, not an extra, add-on luxury,” Ms. Schiffrin said. “If you can’t provide accurate, quality information to your customers, then you’re not a going concern.”"

Elon Musk wages war on Apple
Elon Musk has been unafraid of picking fights, whether with prominent politicians, political whistle-blowers or his own employees. But in taking on Apple on Monday, the Twitter owner was trying to start a brawl that could have ramifications stretching from Silicon Valley to Washington.
Mr. Musk complained that Apple had paused most of its advertising on Twitter, continuing his berating of companies that have done so. But it’s his allegation that Apple “threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store but won’t tell us why” that could prove more important.
Apple is a major source of ad dollars for Twitter. It was the biggest advertiser on the platform in the year’s first quarter, spending $48 million, according to The Washington Post.
Mr. Musk’s App Store allegation resurrects a potent charge against Apple: that it has used access to millions of iPhone and iPad devices as a cudgel to extract more money from app makers. A key part of Mr. Musk’s plans for Twitter is collecting more revenue from subscriptions — but under Apple’s policies, up to 30 percent of those sales from iPhone users would go to Apple itself. (“Did you know Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?” Mr. Musk tweeted.)

But Mr. Musk has also pitched his complaint in bombastically broader terms, calling it “a battle for the future of civilization.” (Twitter’s former head of public safety, Yoel Roth, wrote in a recent Times guest essay that Apple’s and Google’s app stores do prohibit certain kinds of content, and that failure to adhere to those rules — including by allowing certain kinds of material on the Twitter app — “would be catastrophic” to Twitter’s business.)
So far, Apple hasn’t commented on Musk’s allegations.
Apple is already being investigated for its App Store policies, including by the Justice Department. Meanwhile, Spotify sued Apple for rejecting its audiobooks app three times, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior. And Epic Games is still locked in a legal fight with Apple over forced use of the company’s in-app payment system. (Epic’s C.E.O., Tim Sweeney, backed Musk’s fight on Tuesday, tweeting, “Apple is a menace to freedom worldwide.”)

Driverless Cars: Across China, more assisted driving systems and robot taxis are being tested than in any other country, with censors limiting discussions about safety.
A Disappearing Internet: The number of Chinese websites is shrinking and posts are being removed and censored, stoking fears about what happens when history is erased.
A Landmark Political Trial: As part of China’s crackdown on dissent, 14 democracy activists in Hong Kong were convicted on national security charges. They now face prison time along with dozens of others.
A Recipe for Total Control: Reviving a Mao-era surveillance campaign, Chinese authorities are tracking residents, schoolchildren and businesses to forestall any potential unrest.
Republicans — including Representative Ken Buck of Colorado and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, the ranking members of the House and Senate antitrust subcommittees — also seized upon Musk’s comments as proof that Apple and Google should open up their app stores.

Inside the last days of FTX
The fallout from FTX’s collapse is still being felt. On Monday, BlockFi, a crypto lender that targeted individual investors, offering them loans and high-interest savings accounts backed by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, filed for bankruptcy. In June, FTX extended a $400 million lifeline to BlockFi, which had been struggling for months. At the time, BlockFi had other bidders offering to help. But in the wake of FTX’s demise, few are willing or able to offer a rescue to failing crypto firms.

FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, appears to have thought that a savior, or solution, would emerge as his own firm flailed. That was the case even in the exchange’s final hours. The result was a chaotic last few days for FTX, which pitted S.B.F., as he’s known, against his former top aides for control of the firm, according to new documents detailed in a report this morning by The Times’s David Yaffe-Bellany. Documents, internal texts and emails sent in the days before FTX’s Nov. 11 bankruptcy filing show S.B.F. as increasingly deluded and desperate; top lawyers and staffs at the firm struggled to convince S.B.F. that bankruptcy was the only option.
In a Nov. 10 email to staff, S.B.F. said he was close to securing new financing from the crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun. It never materialized.
Senior FTX employees reached out to S.B.F.’s father, the Stanford Law School professor Joe Bankman, in an effort to get his son to give up control of the company.
S.B.F. delayed the hiring of John Jay Ray III, the restructuring expert who has since taken over the company, thinking he still had time to raise new funds.
Early on Nov. 11, S.B.F. refused to sign off on FTX’s bankruptcy filing.
“The founding team is not in a cooperative posture,” Ryne Miller, a top FTX lawyer based in the U.S., wrote in an email to S.B.F. and other staffers. “Please can you sign the document,” Miller wrote S.B.F. at 2:29 a.m. on Nov. 11.
S.B.F. continues to believe he could have saved the firm. Even after FTX filed for bankruptcy, and having resigned as C.E.O., he continued contacting potential investors about providing new funding. In a brief interview this weekend, S.B.F. told The Times that he had lined up “numerous parties” willing to invest in FTX, even after its collapse, though he declined to name them.
Here’s what else is happening in crypto this morning.
Digital asset prices are bouncing back, with Bitcoin up 1.7 percent to trade near $16,500.
A venture firm tied to Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire and a major Bitcoin booster, held a 19 percent stake in the now-bankrupt BlockFi.
BlockFi is suing S.B.F.’s investment vehicle to seize the shares it owns in Robinhood, the trading app operator. According to BlockFi, the FTX founder had pledged the stock as collateral, but never paid up.
The crypto exchange Kraken agreed to pay $360,000 to settle a dispute with the Treasury Department over whether it violated sanctions policy by allowing users in Iran to trade crypto.

Why China’s zero-Covid policy matters to the world
China is once again moving global markets on Tuesday — this time, higher.
Investors appear to be betting Beijing will ease its zero-Covid policy, even as authorities reasserted their commitment to the approach. Rare public protests against President Xi Jinping’s highly restrictive policy have been largely quashed, but the damage to the economy is putting pressure on the government to reopen parts of the country that are under full or partial lockdown.
The evidence of any easing is thin. China announced it would renew its vaccination push for older people, but otherwise has only slightly tweaked its anti-Covid policy. In Shanghai, the country’s financial center, authorities closed some businesses and reintroduced quarantine for close contacts. Nevertheless, stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rebounded sharply on Tuesday, and that risk-friendly mood has swept into Europe and U.S. stock futures. Here’s how China’s approach to the virus almost three years after the start of the pandemic is still preoccupying global investors:
China’s growth is slowing. Nomura last week cut its China G.D.P. forecast for this year (+2.8 percent) and next (+4 percent), predicting a rocky road ahead. “Markets might be tumultuous this week. Reopening will be slow, painful and bumpy,” Ting Lu, the bank’s chief China economist, warned investors on Monday. If that slowdown further hits China’s massive manufacturing sector, there would be consequences for the global supply chain — Apple already expects a production shortfall of 6 million iPhones because of disruptions at a Zhengzhou factory — and stocks. Apple fell 2.6 percent on Monday, underperforming the S&P 500.
Commodity prices are highly dependent on China. The country “consumes 40 to 70 percent of global commodity supply,” Tom Price, head of commodities strategy at Liberum, an investment bank, told DealBook. Uncertainty over whether Chinese factories and industrial plants would be shut because of infection has added volatility to the pricing of everything from crude oil to iron and gold in recent weeks, Price noted.
A possible silver lining: the impact on emissions. China is the world’s biggest greenhouse-gas emitter. One effect of zero-Covid crackdowns in cities across the country: the Chinese have been driving less frequently. According to Rystad Energy, “Chinese road traffic remains well below comparable 2020 and 2021 levels as persistent lockdowns and China’s growth slowdown weigh on road traffic.” If that were to persist, it could limit oil prices in the short term — something to watch as OPEC+ nations meet next week to determine production policy.

2022-12-02,"In one of the year’s most expensive sales, a brand-new penthouse near the top of 220 Central Park South sold for $72 million.
The full-floor aerie was acquired in an apparent off-market deal by an anonymous buyer, who also picked up a smaller unit on a lower floor of the skyscraper, which holds the country’s record for the highest price paid for a single residence.
Across town, at the boutique condominium at 150 East 78th Street, another big penthouse sale took place — this one a new duplex selling for $33.4 million. Also, Suzy Welch sold the Fifth Avenue duplex that she and Jack Welch, the former head of General Electric, had bought two years before his death. And Eric Adjmi, who runs an athletic apparel company, bought two floors at a new condo on Third Avenue.
Among New York City’s other prominent closed transactions in November, all of them co-ops, the restaurateur Simone Falco and his wife, Katy Brodsky Falco, traded in their West Chelsea apartment for a full-floor unit on Park Avenue. The real estate developer Charles Bendit and his wife, Karyn Bendit, acquired a double-size apartment on the Upper West Side.

And the actress Daphna Kastner, wife of the actor Harvey Keitel, sold an apartment at 55 Hudson Street in TriBeCa. This was another off-market deal, and little information was available about the unit, except that it sold for $5.2 million, and the buyers were Johnny S. Donadic and Nicole Blaskovic.
The Central Park South penthouse that closed at $72 million sits on the building’s 75th floor and encompasses 5,021 square feet.
The apartment has three bedrooms, four full bathrooms and a powder room, according to the most recent offering plan by the developer, Vornado Realty Trust. Plus, there’s a 312-square-foot terrace with nosebleed views of the park, city skyline and beyond.
The new owner, under contract since early May, made the purchase through the limited partnership 220 CPS PH75. The entity also bought a 917-square-foot suite on the 19th floor, with one bedroom and one bathroom, paying $3 million.
The penthouse sale is the city’s third biggest in 2022. The most expensive? A pair of co-ops sold together for $101 million by the estate of Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft, at 4 East 66th Street, and a penthouse atop the Crown Building at 730 Fifth Avenue, for $75.9 million.
The limestone-clad 220 Central Park South, designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, broke the record for the most expensive sold home more than three years ago with the hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin’s nearly $240 million purchase of four floors.

The Upper East Side duplex penthouse that sold for $33.4 million, and was the month’s second biggest sale, takes up the top two floors of the 25-unit building at 150 78th Street and Lexington Avenue, also from the drawing boards of Robert A.M. Stern Architects.
The rambling, 7,288-square-foot apartment comes with eight bedrooms, eight and a half bathrooms, and two kitchens, a godsend for holiday entertaining. The 1,500 square feet of outdoor space includes terraces off the living room and one of the kitchens.
The buyer used the limited liability company MF 150 Holdings in the purchase.
Ms. Welch, an author and TV commentator, sold her duplex, at 834 Fifth Avenue, between East 64th and 65th Streets, for $21 million, a $4 million reduction from last year’s initial asking price. She and Mr. Welch had bought the home in 2018 for almost $18.8 million, then spent the next several months renovating; he died in 2020.
The buyers were John Vogelstein, a venture capitalist, and his wife, Barbara Vogelstein. They made the purchase through a trust.

The apartment has around 5,040 square feet and contains a total of three sizable bedrooms, four full bathrooms and two half bathrooms. The primary bedroom suite features a windowed dressing room large enough to hold wardrobes for every season, as well as two onyx bathrooms.
Off the enormous eat-in kitchen is a stairway that leads to a guest suite, with one of the bedrooms, a full bathroom and an extra room that could be used as another bedroom or office.
Throughout the apartment are ornate moldings, hardwood floors and prewar mantels on the two wood-burning fireplaces.

The apartment closing comes a little more than a year after Ms. Welch’s $22.8 million purchase of a 40-foot-wide townhouse with a two-car garage and rear garden on East 81st Street.
Mr. Adjmi bought two full floors at 1059 Third Avenue, a.k.a. the Leyton, between 62nd and 63rd Streets on the Upper East Side, for $16.8 million, presumably to combine into a duplex. They have a total of six bedrooms, three full bathrooms and two powder rooms, and around 6,100 square feet, according to StreetEasy.
Each floor has walls of windows and outdoor terraces that provide painting-worthy vistas of the East River, Central Park and Midtown skyline.
Mr. Adjmi is the chief executive of the Adjmi Apparel Group, which manufactures brands like Champion, Izod and Fila.
The Falcos sold their home at 177 Ninth Avenue in West Chelsea for nearly $12.3 million, then turned around and bought another residence, at 800 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill, for almost $11.9 million.
Their old apartment, measuring around 3,176 square feet, has four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, and is situated between West 21st and West 22nd Street. The buyers were Jin Chung Ha and Sung Wook Chung.
The Park Avenue apartment, which takes up an entire floor, is between East 74th and 75th Streets. The former owners, John Drouet Fennebresque and Christie Schiff Fennebresque, made a tidy profit on the sale of the unit, for which they had paid $8.7 million in early 2020.
The freshly renovated home has five bedrooms, each with an en suite bathroom, along with a laundry room and two powder rooms.
But probably the best part — at least for Mr. Falco — is the expansive, windowed kitchen, which comes equipped with top-of-the-line appliances (including a wine fridge and two dishwashers), custom cabinetry, Carrara marble countertops and center island, and a spacious butler’s pantry.
Mr. Falco, a veteran restaurateur and chef, currently runs Simo Pizza, an Italian restaurant with locations in Greenwich Village and the Meatpacking District.

At 15 West 81st Street, the Bendits also got a discount on their apartment, paying $10.5 million, below the initial $12.9 million asking price from last year.
Their spacious new home has around 5,000 square feet, which includes five bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms, a den, formal dining room with a wall of bookshelves, and a separate laundry room and home office. There’s a ton of storage throughout the unit, with walk-in closets in all but one of the bedrooms. And then there are the stunning views of Central Park and the nearby American Museum of Natural History.
The biggest room, measuring around 32-by-18 feet, is the kitchen, and it’s outfitted with high-end appliances, a large center island and a breakfast nook. Another great spot for holiday cooking.
Mr. Bendit is a chief executive and co-founder of Taconic Partners, whose numerous citywide projects include the Essex Crossing mixed-use development on the Lower East Side.
The seller was Clara Bingham, an author and documentary film producer."

Oil prices climb despite efforts to cap Russian exports
Crude oil prices rose this morning after a whirlwind of events that could drastically alter the supply and pricing of energy this winter.
An E.U. embargo on Russia’s seaborne oil imports went into effect on Monday, following a decision on Sunday by OPEC producers and Russia to keep production quotas unchanged. Those developments, together with an agreement on Friday by Group of 7 nations to impose a $60 price cap on Russian crude and the emergence of more signs that China is easing its Covid restrictions, set off a modest buying spree among energy traders.
By 6 a.m. Eastern, Brent crude, the global benchmark, climbed 2.7 percent, topping $87 per barrel, and West Texas Intermediate was above $82 a barrel.

Crude prices have whipsawed since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, rocketing above $100 per barrel in the spring, only to fall over the summer on fears of a global recession. A slowdown in China in particular had capped demand, but prices have remained volatile.
Image
Analysts have been scrutinizing fallout from the oil price cap, a move designed to punish Russia for the war in Ukraine — but also meant to avoid significant distortions in the energy markets that would force consumers and businesses to pay even higher prices for fuel.
Unsurprisingly, Moscow said this weekend that it wouldn’t accept the Western price cap, and that it would cut sales to countries that participate in the arrangement. How much of an effect that will have is unclear: Even before Monday, European countries have systematically reduced their Russian crude purchases since the start of the war in Ukraine — only for China to step in and buy more oil, often at a discount. But in recent weeks, China has paused some purchases as it waited for details of the price cap to be announced.
Helima Croft, the head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, warned in an investor note this weekend that prices could be even more volatile in the weeks ahead as traders watch for signs that Russia could fully cut off oil exports to former trading partners in retaliation for the price cap.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Chinese cities ease zero-Covid restrictions. Shenzhen and Shanghai were the latest big cities to scrap requirements like testing before traveling on public transport, following widespread protests against Beijing’s tough pandemic rules. Shares in Hong Kong and Shanghai jumped amid investor hopes of a broader easing of Chinese Covid restrictions, though analysts warned such a move would take time.
Lachlan Murdoch is set to testify in a Fox News lawsuit on Monday. The C.E.O. of Fox will be deposed as part of a lawsuit against the network by Dominion Voting Systems. He is the highest-ranking executive to be ensnared in the lawsuit, in which Dominion argues it was defamed by Fox News anchors repeatedly amplifying false claims about the company’s voting machines in the 2020 election.
Wall Street banks weigh cutting bonuses. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase may cut bonus pools for investment bankers by as much as 30 percent, Bloomberg reports, amid a steep drop in M.& A. activity. That follows plans by Goldman Sachs to cut bonuses for its traders, even though their division posted strong results.
Credit Suisse’s investment bank spinoff reportedly draws big new backers. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and a merchant bank run by the former Barclays C.E.O. Bob Diamond may invest in CS First Boston, which is set to be spun off from Credit Suisse, The Wall Street Journal reports. The spinoff is a key part of the Swiss bank’s planned revamp.

Crypto’s false calm
If this is the crypto apocalypse, investors see a buying opportunity. The price of Bitcoin is up nearly 7 percent, or almost $1,200, in the past week, to just under $17,400.

But that market calm does not mean the crypto contagion is contained. The fallout from the collapse last month of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange, FTX, has spread to other firms, setting off a wave of layoffs, lawsuits and investigations. Shareholders of Silvergate, the U.S. bank that processed payments and money transfers for FTX, sued the bank for negligence, calling the exchange a Ponzi scheme.

Meanwhile, customers of Gemini, the crypto exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins, are owed as much as $900 million from Genesis, the crypto lender that has faced severe financial distress since FTX’s collapse, according to The Financial Times. And ByBit, a major crypto exchange, announced this weekend that it would cut 30 percent of its staff, the latest firm to cut its head count as digital asset prices sink.
Here’s what else is happening in crypto:
Mr. Bankman-Fried said on Sunday that he would be willing to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. The catch: S.B.F., as he is known, probably won’t be ready to speak with lawmakers in time for Dec. 13 hearings into the implosion of FTX.
Mr. Bankman-Fried’s media tour shows no signs of slowing down. He told The Financial Times that he regretted giving Alameda Research, the trading affiliate of FTX, favorable borrowing limits.
S.B.F.’s father, the Stanford law professor Joseph Bankman, has canceled a class he was set to teach next year. Bankman did work for FTX’s philanthropic efforts and is helping with his son’s legal defense.
FTX’s bankruptcy has international regulators, including those in Cyprus, Turkey and the Bahamas, squabbling over the company’s assets, potentially complicating which customers get repaid and how much.
Andrew Vara, the U.S. bankruptcy trustee for FTX’s case, called on the Delaware court to appoint an independent examiner into the exchange’s sudden collapse, saying there is substantial evidence to suggest that misconduct and fraud were involved.
Even though calls for investigations are intensifying, that doesn’t mean Bankman-Fried’s arrest is imminent.
On the light side: S.B.F., an eager player of the League of Legends video game, has been getting shade from the likes of Elon Musk and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being a mediocre player.
Have normal times returned to Twitter?
Elon Musk is still running Twitter, so naturally, there is still plenty of drama around the social network — notably in the billionaire owner’s decision to actively promote the release of internal documents about executives’ 2020 decision to restrict tweets linking to a news report about Hunter Biden.
Despite that, it appears that some major advertisers are slowly returning to Twitter’s platform, after many hit pause following Musk’s promise to revamp how the site moderates user content.
ADVERTISEMENT

Amazon plans to resume buying ads on Twitter, to the tune of $100 million a year, according to Zoë Schiffer of Platformer. Although the e-commerce giant, unlike others, had not quit its ad spending altogether since Musk’s takeover, it had paused some of its campaigns.
Meanwhile, Mr. Musk said in a live audio event on Twitter over the weekend that Apple had “fully resumed” ad spending on the social network. The iPhone maker has long been one of the biggest ad purchasers on Twitter. Last week, Mr. Musk said that he had resolved a feud with Apple, chalking up the disagreements to a misunderstanding.
That’s a rare bit of welcome news for Twitter’s business. The Times reported last week that the company had rapidly cut revenue projections, as U.S. ad sales continued to come in well below internal expectations. Advertisers have been alarmed by Mr. Musk’s pledges to lessen restrictions on user content, as well as a botched rollout of revamped verification badges that briefly let paying subscribers impersonate brands. Automakers like G.M. have also been concerned that Twitter could share their ad data with the Musk-owned Tesla, a key rival.
Mr. Musk introduced a new bit of drama into Twitter over the weekend, when he touted the release of the so-called Twitter Files. The independent journalist Matt Taibbi — who famously called Goldman Sachs a “vampire squid” — published internal documents showing executives’ deliberations about how to handle dissemination of a New York Post story based on files from a laptop stolen from Hunter Biden.
The move rankled some former Twitter executives, including the company’s former head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, who said publicizing unredacted documents was “fundamentally unacceptable.” (Musk later conceded, “I think we should have excluded some email addresses.”)

2022-12-06,"In a last-minute attempt to placate antitrust regulators, Microsoft said on Tuesday night that it would bring the blockbuster video game franchise Call of Duty to Nintendo devices if its $69 billion acquisition of the game’s maker, Activision Blizzard, was completed.
Microsoft’s deal to buy Activision — the largest consumer technology deal since AOL bought Time Warner two decades ago — faces reviews by antitrust regulators around the globe.
Many in the video game industry expect the Federal Trade Commission to discuss the acquisition in a closed-door session scheduled for Thursday. The commission could vote on whether to file a lawsuit in an effort to block the deal.
Regulators are primarily focused on concerns that consumers would be harmed if Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, withheld Activision’s games from competitors or unfairly leveraged Activision’s popular titles as more video games were streamed online.

The 10-year deal to bring future releases of Call of Duty to Switch video game devices made by Nintendo, one of Microsoft’s rivals, is part of Microsoft’s efforts to signal that it wouldn’t block the popular game from devices made by other companies.
Microsoft also announced that it would continue its commitment to release Call of Duty with Valve, the maker of the Steam distribution platform, which is popular with gamers who play on personal computers rather than game consoles. Call of Duty’s latest release is already available on Steam.
“There’s been some question about whether what we’re saying is actually how we’re acting, and I think having two major industry partners kind of show that our intent is real and that we can reach agreements is an important thing in this time,” Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft’s gaming business, said in an interview.
Call of Duty is also a key video game for Sony’s PlayStation console, and Microsoft has offered to maintain that relationship for at least another 10 years if the Activision deal goes through. Sony declined to comment on Microsoft’s offer after it was made. Sony has objected to Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, arguing that it would reduce choices for gamers.
“We’re happy that Microsoft wants to continue using Steam to reach customers with Call of Duty when their Activision acquisition closes,” Gabe Newell, the president of Valve, said in a statement. “Microsoft has been on Steam for a long time and we take it as a signal that they are happy with gamers’ reception to that and the work we are doing.”
Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A long-running franchise in which players fight in historical, present-day and futuristic battles, Call of Duty is a crown jewel in Activision’s portfolio. It has earned more than $30 billion in revenue. The latest version, Modern Warfare II, made more than $1 billion in just 10 days.
For Nintendo, adding a violent first-person shooter game like Call of Duty to the host of titles available to play on the Switch would be an uncommon departure. The company has long been protective of the playful, family-friendly branding it has developed over decades through iconic franchises like Mario, Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda, though it does offer some more mature games and other Nintendo devices have hosted Call of Duty.
Sony and Microsoft have sparred often over a similar segment of so-called hard-core gamers, who might be more drawn to dark, story-driven games or challenging and violent combat games.
But Nintendo has built an empire marketing lovable, candy-colored characters, like the squishy pink Kirby and the smiling dinosaur Yoshi. At the beginning of the pandemic, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a tranquil game in which players build virtual islands, became a smash hit.
Nintendo’s newest console, the Switch is significantly cheaper than Sony’s PlayStation 5 or Microsoft’s Xbox Series X, and differs from the more expensive, boxier consoles by being small and portable, so players can game on the go.
The Switch has been a huge success, selling 114 million units as of the end of September. But it has less processing power than the newest Microsoft and Sony consoles, raising questions about what kind of an experience playing Call of Duty would be on a Nintendo device.
“Nintendo has done a great job of creating a family-friendly platform that can be successful for all kinds of creators,” Mr. Spencer said, adding that there was “definitely work” to be done to make Call of Duty run well on the Switch.
Still, Nintendo does already offer some shooter games on the Switch, like Fortnite, and Call of Duty could appeal to Nintendo users who want a “flexible style of gameplay,” said David Gibson, a senior analyst for the Australian-based financial services company MST Financial. The move, he said, would be “good for Nintendo’s platform for sure.”
Gaming has become Microsoft’s most important consumer business, and when it announced the Activision acquisition in January it signaled that getting approval from antitrust regulators could be cumbersome. Microsoft said closing the deal could take a year and a half, and agreed to pay Activision as much as $3 billion if the tie-up falls apart.
In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, wrote about the 10-year offer to Sony and said the company was “open to providing the same commitment to other platforms and making it legally enforceable by regulators in the U.S., U.K. and European Union.”"
2022-12-07,"LOS ANGELES — Steve Ballmer, the owner of the N.B.A.’s Clippers, is known for being a wacky guy. He sits courtside at home games and punches at the air wildly, leaping from his seat, dancing and shouting.
He is intense.
He once said he wanted to put spikes in the seats at the Clippers’ next arena to keep fans up and cheering. But he swears it was just a joke.
What he really wants, and won’t get, is for the seats to vibrate.
“Haptic feedback,” he said. “You know, BRRR.”
If Ballmer had it his way, the whole city would buzz with excitement about the Clippers, the perennially unloved and underachieving little brother to the Lakers. He is spending his considerable energy, and billions of his fortune, to carve out real space for the Clippers in a crowded Los Angeles sports market.

“What does it take to succeed when you’re behind?” Ballmer, 66, said. “Well, it takes a while. You have to be patient. It takes a while to capture people’s loyalties. You have to be successful. You got to build a good product, which means we have to have good teams out there year in and year out. Got to win championships.”
He added: “I have to live a long and full life so we can get there.”
The Lakers have spent decades establishing their identity as one of the N.B.A.’s glamour franchises. They are the team of Showtime, of championships, of the league’s biggest stars, like Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. Hollywood’s elite come to their games to see the show and to be seen.
The Clippers have struggled to define themselves, but since Ballmer bought the team in 2014 its reputation has started to change.
Stars like Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have chosen to join the Clippers. The team is preparing to leave Crypto.com Arena, which it shares with the Lakers and other teams in downtown Los Angeles, for a glittering new arena 11 miles away in Inglewood in 2024. The once-dominant Lakers have made the playoffs just twice since Ballmer bought the Clippers, creating an opportunity for the Clippers to gain ground among local men’s basketball fans.

The Clippers made only four playoff appearances between 1984-85, when they moved to Los Angeles from San Diego, and 2010-11, the season before they traded for the All-Star point guard Chris Paul. The Lakers won eight championships during that period.
“The Clippers always been looked at as the other team,” said Paul Pierce, the Hall of Fame player who grew up in Inglewood and spent the final two years of his 19-year N.B.A. career with the Clippers.
There were moments when the Clippers flashed into the imagination of the basketball world. In the early 2000s, a group of young players — Darius Miles, Lamar Odom and Quentin Richardson among them — earned fans’ adoration with their fun personalities and the playing style of an ultra-talented pickup team. But the Clippers made the playoffs only once in the first decade of the century.
“The Clippers never really had a place, you know what I mean?” said Baron Davis, 43, a retired two-time All-Star guard who grew up in Los Angeles and played for U.C.L.A. “And I knew when I signed with the Clippers, my goals in three years, four years, we wanted to make it another destination in L.A.”
They did not become serious contenders until they traded with New Orleans for Paul in December 2011 and ushered in the so-called Lob City era, named for the way Paul would connect with the high-flying forward Blake Griffin for thrilling dunks to punctuate fast breaks.

That period coincided with a downturn for the Lakers, opening the door for some fans, particularly younger ones, to choose the Clippers.
“The Lakers sucked when I first started watching basketball,” Charlie Muir, a high school senior, said at a recent Clippers game. He added: “I saw the Clippers. They had, like, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin. It was Lob City era so it was really exciting to watch.”
The teams that included Paul and Griffin had their best shot at winning a championship in 2014, but fell short and had to deal with a scandal. During the playoffs that season, TMZ published audio of the team owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks about Black people.

“Dad, that team’s going to be for sale,” Ballmer recalled his son saying. “You need to buy it.”

Ballmer, a basketball fanatic who is a former chief executive of Microsoft, lived in Seattle and had grown up in Detroit, so he wasn’t familiar with the dynamics of having two major teams from the same league in the same city.
“The notion that, like, somebody you run into on the street might be against your team, to me, that was like, whoa, zany,” Ballmer said.
For years, Loyola Marymount University published the results of an annual survey that asked Los Angeles County residents which sports team with Los Angeles in its name was their favorite. In 2014, when there were eight such teams, 6.7 percent of respondents chose the Clippers, significantly less than the Lakers (42.9 percent) and Major League Baseball’s Dodgers (33.8 percent) but still more than the five other teams.
By 2021, the Lakers and Clippers had become less favored and the N.F.L.’s Rams, which re-entered the market in 2016 after two decades away, had picked up 6 percent of the vote. There are nine professional men’s teams that have Los Angeles in their name, a W.N.B.A. team, a National Women’s Soccer League team and two colleges with major sports programs — U.C.L.A. and Southern California — that all compete for attention.

The Clippers, Lakers and Kings have shared an arena since 1999, when Staples Center — which was renamed Crypto.com Arena last year — opened in downtown Los Angeles. The W.N.B.A.’s Sparks joined them in 2001. The Clippers have third priority, so they have to build their schedule around the Lakers and Kings. They cover the Lakers’ championship banners with their own signage during home games. There are 10 statues in the plaza in front of the arena: six honoring Laker greats, three featuring Kings and one of the boxer Oscar De La Hoya. Los Angeles is the only city in the United States where multiple pairs of teams in the same sports share buildings.
“I think anyone, to some degree, that is not the Lakers or Dodgers, there’s a challenger status that is a little bit unique,” said Kevin Demoff, the Rams’ chief operating officer.
After 21 seasons in St. Louis, the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016. They won the Super Bowl in the 2021 season, in Inglewood at SoFi Stadium, which they share with the Chargers.
“Winning is the cover charge to getting people to appreciate you, especially if you’re in that challenger status,” Demoff said. But he added: “This is not a city where one championship can change your fortunes for a long time. That is just what’s expected.”
Except for the Clippers, Chargers and the N.W.S.L. team Angel City F.C., which played its first season this year, all of the major professional sports teams in the Los Angeles market have won at least one championship.

Thilo Kunkel, an associate professor at Temple University who studies sports branding, said it is possible, and necessary, for a team to build a brand independent of winning championships. He pointed to London, which has more than a dozen professional soccer teams, many of which have robust fan bases even when they are struggling.
“Winning a championship is really putting all eggs in one basket, and that’s a basket everyone else wants as well,” Kunkel said. “A strategic way to build a brand community is creating a vision — who we are, what we stand for.”
Both Kunkel and Demoff said the Clippers’ move to their own arena will be important to that end.
“They’ve done a really nice job of finding their own lane in the sports brand world in Los Angeles, and now they can fully lean into that rather than having to take down signage from one game in 12 hours and put up something,” Demoff said.
Ballmer’s financial commitment to differentiating the Clippers applies on and off the court. The team said it spent $10 million resurfacing 350 basketball courts in community parks around Los Angeles, and others in Inglewood, Moreno Valley (Leonard’s hometown) and Palmdale (George’s hometown). Ballmer spent $2 billion to buy the team, and he is financing the new arena, the $2 billion Intuit Dome.
As the Clippers studied seating options for the new arena, they built more than 20 sets of small-scale grandstands, and Ballmer sat in all of them. In downtown Los Angeles at the Intuit Dome Experience Center, which includes sample suites and seating options, visitors can test the seats with haptic feedback (not spikes) that the team ultimately decided were too jarring. Ballmer’s goal is personalization: Clippers fans will even have some control over the temperature in their sections.

To help amplify the crowd noise and create the kind of supporters section that is common in soccer stadiums, one side of the arena will have what Ballmer calls the “Wall of Sound”: 4,700 seats lined up without breaks for stairs or aisles.
He has consulted his players and coaches about what to include in their new practice courts and locker rooms.

The players, of course, are the key to the whole revitalization.
There was a time when it would have been unthinkable that superstars would choose the Clippers. Paul, after all, arrived via trade, and the team drafted Griffin No. 1 overall in 2009. But both Leonard and George spurned overtures from the Lakers and have settled in with the Clippers.
“People like Kawhi because he’s soft-spoken — he don’t speak,” said Darrell Bailey, the superfan better known as Clipper Darrell. He added that he loved Leonard’s attitude. “At the end of the day, Kawhi comes and does his job.”

The Clippers have kept a talented supporting cast around their stars, giving them the second-highest payroll in the N.B.A. For Ballmer, that could mean a big luxury tax bill, the financial penalty for the league’s biggest spenders.
“I’ll pay it,” he said with a little sigh and shrug. In September, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $83 billion.
“I’ve been extremely blessed financially,” Ballmer said. “Am I kind of an open checkbook where, you know, nothing’s too big? I don’t know. No one’s tested me on that. But I’m willing to spend.”

The Clippers said they had seen a return on Ballmer’s investment. They hired three sports and consumer research agencies to study their fan base and found that it had more than tripled between 2014 and 2021. The Clippers said ticket sales and sponsorship revenue had also increased during that time.

“You’ve finally got an owner that cares,” Pierce said.
Before the season, Ballmer was asked if he was excited that the Clippers seemed to be healthy. He clapped his hands and the sound boomed as though a large balloon had just popped. Then he grinned and stuck out his tongue, lifting both feet off the ground as he rubbed his hands together.
“Ohhh, yes, I am!” he said. “Yes, I am!”
But Leonard, who missed last season with a knee injury, has played in just six of the team’s 25 games this year because of injuries. George recently missed seven straight games with his injuries. The Clippers are 14-11 — better than the Lakers but below reasonable hopes for a team with such big-name stars.
While they are not resting all of their brand-building hopes on winning championships, they know how important on-court success is. Lest they forget, there are constant reminders of the championship expectations for Los Angeles sports teams. Some have won quickly after joining the fray, while the Clippers have yet to win a title in nearly four decades in Los Angeles.
On Nov. 12, members of Los Angeles F.C., an expansion soccer team that played its first game in 2018, visited the Clippers. They brought along a prop that Ballmer posed with: the M.L.S. Cup trophy — their first — they had won a week before.

2022-12-08,"The Federal Trade Commission, in one of the most aggressive actions taken by federal regulators in decades to check the power of the tech industry’s giants, on Thursday sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard.
The F.T.C. said that the deal would harm consumers because Microsoft could use Activision’s blockbuster games like Call of Duty to lure gamers from rivals. The agency’s commissioners voted 3to 1 to approve filing the suit.
The decision is a blow to the expansion of Microsoft’s video game business, which has become its most important consumer unit and topped $16 billion in annual sales during the most recent fiscal year. For the F.T.C. chair, Lina Khan, a legal scholar who rocketed to fame after she wrote an article criticizing Amazon, the lawsuit will test whether her aggressive plan to rein in the power of Big Tech can survive in the courts.
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision would be the largest consumer technology deal since AOL bought Time Warner two decades ago. It would marry Microsoft’s Xbox console and game streaming service, which many consider gaming’s future, with Activision titles like Call of Duty and Candy Crush. The scale of those games is enormous: Activision says it has almost 370 million active users each month.

“Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,” said Holly Vedova, director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Competition, in a statement. “Today we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.”
Microsoft indicated it would not abandon the deal and would fight in court to keep the acquisition alive.
“We continue to believe that this deal will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in a statement. “We have been committed since day one to addressing competition concerns, including by offering earlier this week proposed concessions to the F.T.C. While we believed in giving peace a chance, we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court.”
In an email to Activision employees, Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive, said the F.T.C.’s move was the result of a regulatory environment based on “ideology and misconceptions about the tech industry.”
“I want to reinforce my confidence that this deal will close,” he wrote. “The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn’t align with the facts, and we believe we’ll win this challenge.”

The deal between Microsoft and Activision has been under review by 16 regulators around the world, but the F.T.C. is the first of three key regulators, including in Britain and the European Union, to reach a decision on the acquisition.
Microsoft has argued that the deal benefits consumers because Microsoft could make Activision’s broad library of games available to more people on different platforms and as part of a bundled subscription to Xbox Game Pass, its Netflix-like streaming offering, instead of downloading and buying each game individually.
But the F.T.C. said customers would be harmed because Microsoft could misuse Activision’s hugely popular games to its advantage, by withholding them from competitors like Sony or leveraging them to get an upper hand as more gaming is streamed online by harnessing the power of Microsoft’s data centers.
Legal experts said the case could be challenging for the F.T.C. to win because Microsoft and Activision do not really play in the same industry, reducing potential monopoly concerns. But the F.T.C. may be trying to pressure European regulators to step up, while making it more difficult for the companies to complete their deal.
The lawsuit follows a final scramble by Microsoft to assuage regulators’ concerns.
In mid-November, Microsoft offered Call of Duty to Sony for 10 years, significantly longer than in a previous offer. On Monday, Mr. Smith, Microsoft’s president who leads its lobbying operations, said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that the company was “open to providing the same commitment to other platforms and making it legally enforceable by regulators in the U.S., U.K. and European Union.”

Late Tuesday night, in an announcement intended to placate regulators, Microsoft said it reached a deal to bring the Call of Duty franchise to Nintendo’s Switch devices — where the games currently are not available — for 10 years if the Activision deal closes.
Microsoft has also gone on the offensive against Sony, which emerged in recent months as the primary opponent of the Activision deal. Sony, which makes the popular video game console PlayStation, told British regulators that the acquisition would put crucial games “under Microsoft’s sole control, giving it an unprecedented content advantage,” and that Microsoft had not offered to make Call of Duty available on Sony’s game streaming service.
In statements, Microsoft has needled its rival directly, including in a Twitter post from Mr. Smith on Tuesday night after the Nintendo deal was announced.
“Any day @Sony wants to sit down and talk, we’ll be happy to hammer out a 10-year deal for PlayStation as well,” he wrote.
Sony declined to comment on the F.T.C.’s decision on Thursday.
Ms. Khan has been skeptical that such promises from companies are better than forcing them to divest assets as part of getting a deal approved or blocking a deal outright. She has said the agency should be more open to filing risky cases that could fail in court if they stretch the boundaries of antitrust law.

The F.T.C. sued in July to block Meta, Facebook’s parent company, from buying a virtual reality start-up for $400 million in a case drawing on little-used legal arguments. A judge began a multiday hearing in the case on Thursday that could determine the fate of the F.T.C.’s suit.
Ms. Khan, who was appointed by President Biden, “has been signaling an appetite to challenge a lot of mergers and not consider a lot of remedies,” like changes to business practices that would make a deal more palatable to regulators, said Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican chair of the F.T.C.
When Microsoft announced the deal to acquire Activision in January, it said it wanted to get a toehold in mobile gaming, where Microsoft barely competes, and acquire a studio that produces hugely popular games, which would make its consoles and game subscription service more appealing. Microsoft’s powerful computing infrastructure and deep pockets make it a leader in the gaming space, but it has struggled to produce hit titles at the same rate as Sony or Nintendo.
Phil Spencer, chief executive of Microsoft’s video game business, called Call of Duty “one of the amazing entertainment franchises on the planet.”
Microsoft indicated approvals would be a substantial hurdle, and told investors it could take 18 months to close. It agreed to pay as much as $3 billion to Activision if the deal falls apart.

Microsoft pursued Activision when the game maker was a troubled company, reeling from a lawsuit filed by a California regulator that accused it of fostering a toxic workplace culture in which women were routinely sexually harassed. For months, Activision employees staged intermittent walkouts and some top executives departed.
Ms. Khan has taken a greater interest in scrutinizing how mergers could hurt workers, and the Communications Workers of America, which had been organizing workers at Activision, initially expressed reservations about the deal. In June, Microsoft announced an agreement with the union where it promised not to oppose unionization at Activision.
In October, the union’s president, Chris Shelton, met with Ms. Khan to praise Microsoft’s commitment to remain neutral in union campaigns and said the deal should be approved. In an opinion piece in The Hill on Monday, Mr. Shelton wrote that approving the deal “would send a game-changing message to corporate America” that labor concerns matter.

2022-12-09,"Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, has pledged to usher in a new era of trustbusting of America’s corporate giants, recently saying the agency plans to “enforce the antitrust laws to ensure maximal efficacy.”
Now Ms. Khan has staked that ambitious agenda on a case that may be highly challenging for the agency to win.
The F.T.C. on Thursday sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of the video game publisher Activision, the biggest consumer tech deal in two decades. The action punctuated Ms. Khan’s statements about reining in corporate power and was the boldest of a recent string of lawsuits from the agency to prevent other, smaller deals in the name of competition.
But Ms. Khan and the F.T.C. face hurdles in trying to stop the Microsoft-Activision deal, experts said. That’s because courts have been skeptical of challenges to so-called vertical mergers, where the two businesses don’t compete directly. In this case, Microsoft is best known in gaming as the maker of the Xbox console, while Activision is a major publisher of blockbuster titles such as Call of Duty.
In addition, Microsoft has made a number of concessions to reduce regulatory concerns about buying Activision — such as pledging that Call of Duty would be available on Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo’s platforms, and not just on Xbox — which some judges may find persuasive.
“It’s undeniably a challenging lawsuit for the commission, because vertical challenges generally have an uphill battle,” said Bill Baer, who led the Justice Department’s antitrust division during the Obama administration and has represented Sony in private practice.

The Biden administration has made reining in big tech companies a priority. Perhaps the strongest signal was the government’s pick for the top antitrust enforcers: Jonathan Kanter, head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, and Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
Both are progressives who want to toughen enforcement and stretch antitrust doctrine. Under Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. has aggressively challenged acquisitions — a quick-strike tool in the antitrust arsenal to prevent the tech industry’s giants from getter bigger.

On Thursday, the agency filed suit to block Microsoft’s $69 billion purchase of video game maker Activision Blizzard, which would be the largest technology deal in decades. And on the same day, it deployed a novel argument to stop a relatively tiny acquisition by Meta, arguing in a California court that the $400 million deal by Facebook’s parent company would harm future competition in the emerging market for virtual reality apps.
Stopping a corporate purchase is one thing. But the larger agenda for the Biden administration’s antitrust enforcers involves major cases that accuse Big Tech of being bullying monopolists. Those cases involve long periods of document collection, deposition taking and courtroom wrangling.
For example, the Justice Department has for over a year been investigating whether Google abuses its dominance of online ad technology to stifle competition. No final decision has been made, but if the lawsuit moves ahead in the coming months it could very likely take years for the case to work its way through the courts. The risk is not only that the ad technology at issue may be obsolete, but also that current and would-be rivals will have abandoned or avoided the market.
The stately pace of traditional antitrust action is also evident in the Justice Department’s first salvo against Google. The suit challenging the company’s behavior in the search market was filed two years ago. It is not expected to go to trial for another year, and even then, with appeals that could go all the way to the Supreme Court, the case may not be resolved till 2027 or later, legal experts say.
If the government wins these cases, a court could order breaking up a company or lasting changes in its behavior. But they are costly, high-stakes legal ventures.

There’s another way to ensure giant tech companies do not abuse their market power, say some antitrust experts and lawmakers. The largest American banks are classified as “systemically important financial institutions” by federal regulators and subject to more stringent scrutiny. And the big telecommunications corporations are designated “common carriers” with obligations to allow access to their networks to other companies. A similar approach could work for Big Tech, they say.
Instead of relying only on antitrust laws and the courts, new rules that apply specifically to tech giants could prevent them from unfairly using their market power to steer users to their products and services. For example, such rules could require the companies to offer open and fair access to their platforms, enable data sharing with new entrants and offer data portability to consumers.
In Congress, there has been some momentum for adopting new rules and regulations. “It is past time to update our competition laws for the digital era,” Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said.
The E.U. and Britain are taking the lead
A bill introduced by Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa last year singled out four tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, which is owned by Alphabet — and aimed to ban them from prioritizing their services over competitors. The bill gained bipartisan support and was endorsed by the Justice Department. But the legislation stalled in the Senate, after the companies spent millions lobbying against the law.

Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, introduced legislation to create a Digital Platform Commission — similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission for finance and the Federal Communications Commission for telecom — that would be able to designate “systemically important digital platforms” subject to additional oversight.

In the European Union and Britain, lawmakers have been more successful in passing legislation to limit the power of Big Tech. The European Parliament’s Digital Markets Act went into force last month. It includes a list of rules and obligations that will apply to companies it deems “gatekeepers” and leaves it up to those companies to figure out how to comply. By 2024, if regulators find the steps a company proposes to be insufficient, it could be fined up to 10 percent of its worldwide revenue or even face a breakup order. (Europe’s antitrust officials are also scrutinizing the Microsoft-Activision deal.)
Britain has a different model that gives big tech companies more of a role in determining their commitments. It set up a Digital Markets Unit to oversee a code of conduct, developing rules tailored for each company. Rishi Sunak, the new prime minister, was a supporter of the regulatory concept as chancellor of the Exchequer, and legislation describing the nondiscrimination rules and the enforcement duties of the digital markets unit is expected in the current session of parliament.
The regulatory experiments in the E.U. member states and in Britain could help to inform American policy and court-ordered remedies, said Fiona Scott Morton, an economist at the Yale School of Management.
“We can pick and choose what seems to be working,” said Ms. Scott Morton, who was an antitrust official in the Obama administration.
‘A window for the big tech players’
Mandated data sharing and interoperability, proponents say, could bring more competition and new offerings for consumers. For example, shoppers could take their past purchase history from Amazon and use it to improve their recommendations from another store. Or a new social network, catering to privacy-conscious users, could connect a person to their Facebook friends without giving Facebook their personal information. More generally, proponents say, seamless interconnection to the big digital platforms could be a boon to entrepreneurs building products and services on top of the platforms — and foster more competition among the tech giants.

And the designations of dominant companies could be fluid. “You want a system where, after shifts in the market and technology, companies and services can come off the list,” said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former senior official in the Justice Department’s antitrust division in the Obama administration.
Even if the government prevails in court against Big Tech, the chances of Google being unseated in search or Amazon becoming an also-ran in e-commerce are slight, said Gene Kimmelman, who was also a senior official in the antitrust division under President Barack Obama. “But you can create more competitive tension in these markets and more openings for mix-and-match technologies.”
Tech companies warn that overly broad regulation can slow innovation, reduce investment and hamper product development, making their products and services harder to use and less useful. They also say there may be unintended consequences if regulators do not carefully weigh trade-offs involving competition, privacy and content moderation. For example, mandated data sharing could undermine privacy if security is less stringent at organizations receiving a person’s information.
In the European Union and Britain, the companies have no choice but to embark on the path of regulation. Better to engage than resist. Even the Digital Markets Act has a provision for “regulatory dialogue,” leaving some room to tweak how the law is carried out.
The potential payoff for big tech companies is that they would have competition rules for the future — a code of conduct that the companies can live with and government regulators worldwide can accept.

Philip Verveer, a Washington lawyer who served in four administrations as an antitrust official and telecommunications regulator, said that more regulation might actually be a relief to big tech companies.

2022-12-11,"LOS ANGELES — Karen Bass was sworn in as the first female mayor of Los Angeles on Sunday and vowed to build consensus among elected leaders as Angelenos contend with racial tensions, surging homelessness and a new rise in coronavirus cases.
Vice President Kamala Harris swore in Ms. Bass in a ceremony that celebrated her historic win but also underscored the obstacles she will face. Ms. Bass said that her first act as mayor on Monday would be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness.
“If we are going to bring Angelenos inside and move our city in a new direction,” Ms. Bass said during her inaugural speech, which was interrupted by protesters at one point, “we must have a single strategy to unite our city and county and engage the state, the federal government, the private sector and every other stakeholder.”
Ms. Bass, a former Democratic congresswoman who was on the shortlist to be President Biden’s 2020 running mate, won election against Rick Caruso, a billionaire real estate developer, in a hard-fought race that remained too close to call until a week after the election.

Los Angeles, a city of four million people, has been rocked by a surge in post-pandemic homelessness and violent crime, prompting an outcry from citizens who say their quality of life has spiraled in recent years. A citywide poll conducted early this year by the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University found that for the first time since 2012, a majority of Angelenos felt the city was going in the wrong direction.
The coronavirus itself also remains a scourge: Officials at the event required attendees to wear masks amid an alarming rise in case numbers in the city.
Homelessness in America
New York City: An annual count by the city found more than 4,100 people sleeping on streets and in subways. It was the most since the city began keeping track nearly two decades ago.
A New Type of Care: Programs are sprouting across the country to provide nursing home and rehabilitation services to homeless people who would otherwise shuttle between hospitals and the street.
Making Music: Therapists from the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music have found that teaching homeless children to make beats and write songs is a way to heal trauma.
What Would Jesus Do?: The “Yes in God’s Backyard” movement to build affordable housing on faith organizations’ properties is gaining steam in California and elsewhere.
Ms. Bass, 69, said she entered the race because the heightened racial divisions and civic unease reminded her of the unrest that preceded the riots that tore the city apart in 1992. In September, her home was burglarized. Ms. Bass, who has long been an advocate for liberal crime prevention policies, promised during her campaign to put more police officers on the streets.
She has also promised to declare a state of emergency on homelessness and find homes for 17,000 homeless people in her first year. In practice, she will have to rely on a broad coalition of city and county officials to enact any sweeping plans to bolster social service programs. According to a September report from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, some 69,000 people are experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County.
Fesia Davenport, the chief executive of Los Angeles County, attended Ms. Bass’s swearing-in ceremony. She said she was hopeful that the new mayor would collaborate with the county to help address homelessness.

Ms. Davenport said she did not usually attend political events but made an exception this time.
“I wanted to help celebrate and commemorate this momentous occasion,” Ms. Davenport said. “I really feel like she has signaled that she’s willing to tackle the really tough issues, not just manage them.”
Though voters have said they are frustrated and cynical about whether a course correction is possible, thousands gathered at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday to celebrate the election of the first woman to lead the city and the second Black mayor after Tom Bradley, who retired in 1993 as the longest-tenured executive in Los Angeles history. Ms. Bass is the latest in a growing number of women who have been elected to local leadership positions.
The ceremony featured musicians including Stevie Wonder — whose performance of “Living for the City” brought the new mayor to her feet — Chloe Bailey and the duo Mary Mary. The event also featured a reading from the poet Amanda Gorman, who ended with a line that drew a standing ovation: “Where there’s a will, there is women, and where there’s women, there’s forever a way.”
Attendees wore rain jackets and carried umbrellas as they waited to go through security. Some were decked out in suits, others in sequins and Santa hats. While the lines wound through the L.A. Live complex, guests held out their phones to snap selfies in front of the theater’s marquee, showing Ms. Bass’s smiling face and her motto: “A New Day for Los Angeles.”
Earle Charles, a professor at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, Calif., approached the front of the line for his first mayoral inauguration in Los Angeles, where he has lived for almost four decades. He said he is a longtime supporter of Ms. Bass and trusts her to carry through on her campaign promises.

“One of the first things, of course, is to take care of the homeless situation,” said Mr. Charles, 69, who lives in Granada Hills in the San Fernando Valley. “To me, that’s the primary issue.”
Other attendees agreed that homelessness should be at the top of the new mayor’s agenda. Bertha Scott-Smith, 54, said she felt as though Ms. Bass’s predecessor, Eric Garcetti, had not had the easiest time making real progress on the issue.
“I hope she doesn’t meet that same pushback,” said Ms. Scott-Smith, who lives in the historically Black neighborhood of Leimert Park.
She said that Ms. Bass’s inauguration felt like a historic moment, particularly with the vice president attending.
Ms. Harris — the first female vice president, the first woman of color to hold her job, a former California attorney general and a former senator — flew to Los Angeles for the occasion with a planeload of Democrats. The roster included Delegate Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands and Representatives Frederica S. Wilson of Florida, Bobby L. Rush of Illinois, Nanette Barragán of California and Tony Cárdenas of California.

Kirsten Allen, the vice president’s spokeswoman, said that Ms. Bass had asked Ms. Harris to swear her in, and the vice president obliged.
“The vice president is invested in her success and knows what she’s up against,” Ms. Allen said, “and will do what she needs to do to make sure she’s successful.”
At the ceremony, Tamaqua Jackson, wrapped in a beret and a scarf, said she believed in Ms. Bass’s ability to tackle homelessness and also help heal a splintered city.
“She seems like she can bring Los Angeles together as one,” Ms. Jackson said, adding that she would like to see Ms. Bass “clean up” the City Council, which has been besieged by controversy in recent months.
Ms. Jackson, 48, has lived in Los Angeles all her life, but this was her first mayoral inauguration, she said. She said the vice president’s appearance added to the appeal of attending in person.

“That’s another high for me: To actually see two people I’ve voted for in person is awesome,” said Ms. Jackson, who works as a commercial driver. “Go women!”

Elon Musk divulges his preferred pronouns.

Why Elon Musk might be taking on Anthony Fauci
Since taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has shown a willingness, and sometimes a relish, to pick public fights with an array of targets, including advertisers, tech giants, employees and more.
But over the weekend, Musk publicly attacked two figures, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, in ways that may resonate with far-right audiences and gin up user engagement — but are likely to deter wary advertisers from flocking back to the social network anytime soon.
“My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,” Musk tweeted on Sunday, scoring points with both critics of the use of nonbinary pronouns and of Mr. Fauci, America’s top immunologist, who disagreed with President Donald Trump on how to reopen the country in 2020. Mr. Musk has previously criticized pandemic lockdowns, having defied one that affected Tesla’s factory in California, and remote work. (Mr. Fauci himself wrote in a Times Opinion guest essay how political divisiveness has hampered public health campaigns.)
Musk’s tweet drew predictable responses, including support from far-right figures like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and rebukes from Democratic lawmakers like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Some on Twitter noted that Musk’s own predictions about the pandemic fell drastically short of reality.

Mr. Musk also spread misinformation about Mr. Roth, misleadingly suggesting that the former Twitter executive’s doctoral thesis advocated for child sexualization. The move opened up Mr. Roth — whom Mr. Musk had publicly supported in the first days of his Twitter ownership, before Mr. Roth quit — to online abuse.
Musk says that he has focused relentlessly on improving public safety on Twitter, and accused previous management of failing to do so. But Jack Dorsey, the company’s co-founder and former C.E.O., disputed that assertion. And three members of Twitter’s Trust & Safety Council announced their resignation last week, citing the company’s increased reliance on automated content moderation.
Is Musk banking on conservative engagement to help Twitter’s business? Musk has pointed to some metrics showing that user engagement is up since he took over. The billionaire may well be politically conservative, but evidence of his actual positions isn’t very clear. In any case, his actions — which also include leaking internal Twitter correspondence about topics like Hunter Biden to sympathetic journalists including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss — have certainly succeeded in winning over right-leaning users and conservative politicians.
But Mr. Musk’s shock tactics don’t seem to be designed to bring back advertisers who paused spending on Twitter amid the chaos during his takeover. (Apple, which was the target of a brief Musk campaign but which hasn’t halted ads on the platform, declined to comment to DealBook on Musk’s latest tweets.) That puts additional importance on Twitter’s efforts to expand revenue beyond ads, including the revamped Twitter Blue subscription service that is set to debut today.
Nor do they seem likely to endear the company to prospective recruits who may already be wary of workplace culture changes that Mr. Musk has wrought. Insider noted that employees had warned prospective hires via the anonymous employer-rating site Blind to stay away from the company and its “toxic” environment.
Mr. Musk certainly didn’t win over the crowd at a Dave Chappelle comedy show on Sunday in San Francisco: He was heavily booed after making a surprise appearance onstage.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Microsoft buys a 4 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange Group. The American software giant acquired the stake from a group led by Thomson Reuters and Blackstone, as part of a $2.8 billion deal that will have the exchange rely on Microsoft’s cloud services. It follows similar business partnerships by other exchanges, including Nasdaq (with Amazon) and CME Group (with Alphabet).
Amgen agrees to buy Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion. The all-cash deal for Horizon, which produces treatments for autoimmune diseases, is the biggest health care transaction of the year. In beating out rivals like Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, Amgen is paying a nearly 20 percent premium to Horizon’s stock price on Friday.
European lawmakers grapple with a Qatar bribery scandal. Over the weekend, the Belgian authorities charged four people with corruption in connection with an investigation into suspected bribes by the Gulf state to current and former members of the European Parliament. The scandal comes as Qatar hosts the men’s soccer World Cup.
Britain prepares for national paralysis over strikes. The British government is drawing up contingency plans, including intervention by the military, to deal with work stoppages across a variety of sectors, including rail and nursing, through the end of the year. Union members have demanded higher wage increases to keep up with inflation.

Covid, inflation and interest rates buffet global markets
December has been a downer for investors so far, and this morning is looking no different. Stock markets from Hong Kong to London are in the red on Monday, as are U.S. futures ahead of a big week of data releases and interest rates decisions.

Stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai closed lower on Monday as concerns grow over the rate of Covid infections in major Chinese cities, after Beijing suddenly eased many of its zero-Covid restrictions. That is feeding into global slowdown fears, which are affecting energy prices. As of 7 a.m. Eastern, Brent crude was down roughly 0.7 percent.
The S&P 500 Index has fallen in nine of the past 11 trading sessions, as recession and inflation fears mount, pushing investors to pare their stock holdings. The benchmark index slumped 3.4 percent last week, its worst weekly performance since September, according to Deutsche Bank equities analysts.

Investors are bracing for another volatile week. Markets will be closely watching Tuesday’s latest Consumer Price Index report for signs that consumer inflation has peaked. And on Wednesday, the Fed will announce what is expected to be a 0.5 percentage point interest rate increase. That same afternoon, the Fed chair, Jay Powell, will deliver his latest assessment of the economy, and is expected to signal the central bank’s policy moves for next year.
It’s a similar picture in Europe. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England will also deliver rates decisions this week, and similarly sized increases are expected. And investors will be tracking consumer price data releases from France, Germany and the U.K., where soaring energy and food prices have pushed core inflation to multidecade highs.

FTX’s C.E.O. showdown
As two congressional committees gear up to scrutinize the multibillion-dollar collapse of crypto empire FTX this week, its fallen founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, still seems to believe in the future of the company, and in his role as a business leader.
Mr. Bankman-Fried hopes to start a new venture, he told the BBC on Saturday, explaining that the goal would be to repay FTX investors. The comments were made a day after he weighed in on a proposal to revive FTX by issuing a new version of the exchange’s token, FTT, writing on Twitter that it would be “a productive path for parties to explore!” The price of FTT rose on his tweet, but the statements would have come as little consolation to FTX’s million creditors.
“I won’t be as helpful as I’d like,” Bankman-Fried warned. He is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, but the former FTX chief executive said there were limits on what he would be able to say because he does not have access to all of his personal or professional data.
It’s not clear whether Mr. Bankman-Fried, who is known as S.B.F., will appear in person. He has also not yet accepted a request to talk to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.

Staying silent may be difficult. The hearing will pit Mr. Bankman-Fried against John Ray, the restructuring expert and current FTX C.E.O. who is managing the bankruptcy and labeled FTX the worst case of corporate failure he had ever seen. S.B.F. has pushed back against that characterization, claiming Mr. Ray made “false” statements in court filings about FTX’s failure.
Mr. Ray reportedly met with Manhattan prosecutors last week. They are apparently looking into suspicious transfers to the Bahamas on the eve of FTX filing for bankruptcy, among other aspects of the collapse.

Other executives are being more circumspect. At least in public. Caroline Ellison, the former C.E.O. of Alameda Research, FTX’s sister trading firm that allegedly used FTX customer funds to back its very risky bets, has stayed quiet — even as Bankman-Fried has tried to shift blame on to her.  Ms. Ellison has reportedly hired a former S.E.C. official steeped in crypto cases, Stephanie Avakian, as her lawyer. Last week, Ms. Ellison was reportedly spotted in a coffee shop not far from the offices of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, giving rise to speculation that she may be cooperating with their investigation.
Here’s what else is happening in crypto today:
South Korean prosecutors believe that the crypto fugitive Do Kwon, who is wanted in the $60 billion collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna tokens, is hiding in Serbia.
Investors are pulling record amounts from crypto coins following the collapse of FTX. And most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are trading lower this morning.
“There’s a risk of a recession. But … it certainly isn’t, in my view, something that is necessary to bring inflation down.”
— Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen believes inflation will fall considerably in 2023. The less-good news: she acknowledges that a downturn in the U.S. economy is a possibility.
The week ahead
Three major central banks — the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England — will set interest rates this week. And there is fresh inflation data coming from the U.S. and Europe.
Tuesday: The U.S. and German consumer price index data for November come in, and the FIFA semifinals begin (Argentina vs. Croatia).

2022-12-14,"WASHINGTON — President Biden sought to revitalize America’s listless relationship with Africa on Wednesday, promising a grab bag of economic initiatives to make up for a predecessor who had denigrated the continent and catch up with strategic competitors like China that have expanded their influence.
Assembling most of Africa’s leaders in Washington for the first time since 2014, Mr. Biden vowed to invest what aides calculated will be $55 billion on the continent over the next three years while supporting its ambitions for greater global leadership and bolstering efforts to transform it into a more prosperous, healthier and technologically advanced region.
“The United States is all in on Africa’s future,” Mr. Biden declared in an address to the delegations of 49 nations attending the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. Adapting a line he often uses to pitch domestic priorities, the president added, “Together, we want to build a future of opportunity where no one, no one, is left behind.”
The three-day gathering may go a long way toward emphasizing American support for Africa, with concrete pledges on issues of great importance. At the same time, it did not include a sweeping, inspirational initiative like President George W. Bush’s PEPFAR program to combat AIDS or President Barack Obama’s Power Africa drive to electrify tens of millions of homes. Unclear was whether Mr. Biden’s less splashy commitments would have an effect that would be noticed and positively shape perceptions of America.
The United States is widely seen as lagging behind China in cultivating Africa, a geopolitical contest that in recent years has expanded to include powers like Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated food shortages in Africa while Covid-19 has disrupted supply chains, multiplying challenges in a region with no shortage of them to begin with.
American influence in Africa dwindled under Mr. Biden’s predecessor, Donald J. Trump, who paid little attention to the continent except to deride some of its 54 nations with an expletive and to complain that after immigrants from Nigeria saw the United States, they would never “go back to their huts.” Mr. Trump spoke of Africa as if the entire continent were a single country, and once confused the name of an African nation.

2022-12-15,"Amazon said on Thursday that it would publish the next iteration of the popular video game franchise Tomb Raider, a coup for the tech giant’s video game business.
Tomb Raider, an action-adventure title developed by a California game studio called Crystal Dynamics, features the character Lara Croft, a British archaeologist who traverses unexplored tombs around the world, solving puzzles and fighting villains.
Recent versions of the game, like the well-regarded 2018 title, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, were published by the Japanese company Square Enix. The franchise has also inspired several feature films.
Crystal Dynamics is still the developer for the upcoming game, which does not yet have a release date and is early in development. But Amazon will be the publisher, meaning the company is working closely with Crystal Dynamics on “creative support” and is responsible for tasks like marketing, shipping the title on various retail and online platforms, and advertising.

The new Tomb Raider game will be the first major, single-player game published by Amazon Games, which struggled for years to break into the challenging, insular world of game development before eventually finding a niche with multiplayer online games. Placing a flagship, single-player game under its portfolio could be a significant step and a boost to Amazon’s credibility in the industry.
“It’s a huge moment for us,” Christoph Hartmann, the vice president of Amazon Games, said in an interview. “If someone told you four years ago Amazon is making games, you would have laughed.”
Under Mike Frazzini, a longtime Amazon executive who departed the company this year, Amazon’s decade-old video game unit floundered. In 2018, the company brought in Mr. Hartmann, an industry veteran who founded 2K Games, which produces popular titles like NBA 2K, to report to Mr. Frazzini.
In 2021, Google, which had also made a foray into video games, shut down the in-house game development arm of its gaming service, Stadia, before announcing this year that it would be ending the entire service. Some thought Amazon and its video game ambitions could meet a similar fate.
But Amazon finally released a popular multiplayer title, New World, last fall, and followed that up with another well-received game this spring, Lost Ark.

Tomb Raider could build on that success. Though Amazon is a late entrant into video games and trails other deep-pocketed companies like Microsoft, Mr. Hartmann says he thinks time is on his side, because he is just one part of a larger company that is patient and not asking for immediate financial success.
“I’m not part of that rat race for who is outperforming the other one — I’m here to build great games,” he said.
After wrapping up a trilogy of games detailing Lara Croft’s origins, the new Tomb Raider game will go “back to our roots,” said Scot Amos, the studio head at Crystal Dynamics, though he said it was too early to give many details.
“There’s a logical evolution of what we can do next there, as far as how we can actually give a bigger adventure and even more things for her to do and more worlds and mysteries for her to explore,” he said.
For Amazon, bringing in video game veterans has paid off. Mr. Amos’s studio had some initial questions about partnering with Amazon, he said, given that it’s a relative newcomer in gaming, but they were won over.

“We didn’t know what Amazon’s group was like when we started this conversation,” Mr. Amos said. “We had known they had a few games out there, but we started talking to Christoph, and it’s like, ‘Oh, by the way, we all have 25, 30 years of history in this business.’”"

2022-12-18,"In a recent speech, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo suggested an incremental shift in how the United States approaches “competitiveness and the China challenge.” She recognized the serious threat from China, explaining that the United States “will continue to press China to address its nonmarket economic practices that result in an uneven playing field.” She noted, though, that “we are not seeking the decoupling of our economy from that of China’s.”
America’s China policy does need to change. The ruthless repression of its Covid-policy protesters is the latest proof of that, but the greater urgency is that the status quo has things moving to the disadvantages of the United States as well as to the benefit of China. An incremental shift is not enough.
In order to truly ensure that economic relations between the two countries continue to be beneficial to America, it is time to adopt an explicit policy of strategic decoupling of our economy from theirs — not a total decoupling, but one that should be done over time and in an organized way.
There are two fronts in any contest with China: the economic front and the national security front. They are not entirely separate. One affects the other. And for policymakers, that is the point.

We must prepare in both spheres — economic and military — because the best way to avoid a military crisis is to maintain our economic superiority.
The purpose of strategic decoupling would be to benefit America, not to punish China or to hold it back. It has become clear that China is not a friend or a partner in development, but rather an adversary bent on world dominance.

In our economic competition, China is winning. We transfer well over $300 billion to the country annually in trade deficits, and China uses it to build its military, improve its competitiveness and buy our assets — increasingly our technology companies and even our farms. A recent report concluded that Chinese firms and investors own a controlling interest in almost 2,400 U.S. companies. China engages in technology theft, espionage and mercantilism to build what Chinese leaders believe will be the world’s dominant economy.
On the national security front, China is a big and rapidly expanding military power, and its objective is to have not just the largest but also the most sophisticated military in the world in the next decade. It is arming the South China Sea at a rate not seen since the Second World War and building military outposts in Africa and elsewhere. It is vastly increasing its nuclear arsenal and asserting territorial claims in India, the Philippines and Vietnam. It is threatening Taiwan. It has executed an agreement of friendship with “no limits” with Russia and is cooperating with the invasion of Ukraine. It has a vast campaign to influence our country, and it is responsible directly or indirectly for much of the fentanyl that is destroying many of our communities.
China’s enterprises have purchased strategic assets in Asia, Europe and South America. The country is monopolizing crucial strategic materials like rare earths, lithium and cobalt.

As if China’s aggressive turn was not clear, candid translations of proceedings at the Communist Party’s 20th National Congress in October show that they de-emphasized phrases like “peace and development” and adopted phrases like “preparing for the storm” and “the spirit of struggle.”
The U.S. objective should be to continue trade and economic activity beneficial to us and to discourage any part that is not. For example, trade in agricultural products, raw material and some consumer and pharmaceutical goods can be mutually beneficial. Importing to the United States computers, automobiles and telecommunications equipment is not.
The objective of this strategic decoupling is simple — reciprocity. It is precisely what China does to us. China has always denied us equal access to its market and has for decades pursued a policy of technological independence. China’s “indigenous innovation” policy began in 2006, and “Made in China 2025” was announced in 2015. The report of the recent 20th National Congress called for China to “increase the security and resilience of China’s own industrial supply chains.”
Strategic decoupling has several aspects. First, we should progressively impose tariffs on all of China’s imports into the United States until we have balanced trade.
Second, we should disentangle our technology. Specifically, we must enhance our export controls to further limit the kinds of technology allowed to be exported and to whom it can go. We need to stop the integration of our advanced industries by discouraging U.S. high-tech manufacturing in China and enact more policies like the CHIPS Act (which authorizes billions of dollars to help companies pay for building or expanding American computer chip factories and for research and worker training) and smart tax and regulatory policies to ensure that advanced technology stays at home or with our allies.

We should support American companies that have begun to recognize the burdens of relying on Chinese manufacturing. For example, Apple has reportedly decided to shift some of its production outside China. The company said it will look to other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, to assemble some Apple products. Likewise Microsoft and Google are moving some or all of their Xbox console and Pixel phone production. Amazon is getting many of its FireTV devices from India.
We should shut down TikTok and other social media platforms that mine our citizens’ data and serve as propaganda organs to influence our public discourse.
China has some of the strictest technology regulations in the world. It is impossible to invest in China at scale without government approval; the Chinese government almost certainly approves all outbound investment to the United States. The country’s policy is what the former Australian prime minister and China expert Kevin Rudd calls “decoupling with Chinese characteristics.”
Finally, we should limit U.S. investment going to China and China’s investment into our industries. Our investment there strengthens its economy and its military, and leads to offshoring of sometimes critical supply chains; its investment in the United States often leads to the loss of technology and sensitive data. This will prevent further economic integration and increase the availability of capital at home and in the West. No investment should be permitted in either direction unless it will strengthen America, not merely enrich a few Americans.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States — a regulatory unit in the Treasury Department — needs to be greatly expanded so that it is not limited to national security concerns but can consider other economic consequences. Last year, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission recommended in its annual report to Congress that the United States pass a similar interagency review screening program for outbound investment to China. Senators Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, have introduced legislation to this effect. It is needed.

In the Trump administration, we began the decoupling process by imposing billions of dollars of Section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports — a legal provision that allows a president to restrict foreign commerce that unfairly burdens the United States — and the expansion of export controls. We recognized the threat and acted.
That policy has been extended under President Biden: His administration kept the tariffs and further expanded export controls and is carrying out provisions of the CHIPS Act. Neither the tariffs nor the export controls have had an appreciable negative effect on our economy.
But they have begun the process of bringing manufacturing back to America and of decoupling our economies. We should do all we can to avoid a military confrontation, and we must continue to talk to and work with China in areas of mutual advantage.
But we must also act alone to begin this strategic decoupling. We cannot hide from the truth about China. Failure to act decisively now is no longer forgivable. It is dereliction.

2022-12-19,"When Epic Games released Fortnite five years ago, the video game quickly became a cultural sensation among millions of teenagers and children. It was easy to sign up and start playing and talking or text chatting with strangers through the game.
Some children also racked up hundreds of dollars on their parents’ credit cards as they bought digital items like colorful outfits for their game characters. Those purchases, along with branded merchandise like action figures, helped make Fortnite a billion-dollar blockbuster for Epic Games, with more than 400 million users.
On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of illegally collecting children’s personal information, of harming young players by matching them with strangers on Fortnite while enabling live communications and, separately, of using manipulative techniques, called “dark patterns,” to trick millions of players into making unintentional purchases. In a historic deal that puts the entire video game industry on notice, Epic agreed to pay a record $520 million in fines and refunds to settle the F.T.C.’s accusations.
The F.T.C. acted at a moment of heightened public concern over the mental health, safety and privacy risks that some popular social media networks and multiplayer video games may pose to children and teenagers.
The crackdown is also the latest indication that the agency is following through on pledges by Lina M. Khan, its chair, to take a more assertive stance toward regulating the tech industry. Earlier this month, the agency made an aggressive move to stop consolidation among video game makers when it filed a lawsuit to try to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company behind the popular Call of Duty franchise.
“Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the commission,” Ms. Khan said in a statement on Monday about the Fortnite case. “These enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the F.T.C. is cracking down on these unlawful practices.”

2022-12-22,"Last year, Madison Winey, 29, wanted to use her vacation days to drive from San Francisco, where she lives, to Bend, Ore., to visit her family. But taking time off from her job as a lawyer at Goodwin Procter always felt like “more stress than it’s worth, especially if you’re just going away for a couple of days,” she said. She would have to start planning for her absence weeks before leaving, and she was expected to provide times when she would check emails.
She had scheduled the visit when she thought there would be a bit of a lull at work — but a project timeline was delayed by two weeks, forcing her to postpone her trip. “All I needed was nine hours on a Saturday to be able to drive up to Bend, and I wasn’t even able to take that,” she said. When she finally made it to Oregon, she worked the whole time.
Despite decades of research that has found that taking time off is good for workers’ mental and physical health, Ms. Winey’s experience is not unique. For those who are fortunate enough to receive paid time off at work, the majority of whom are full-time office workers, using those precious days can also create anxiety about re-entry. In a survey in November, the career website Monster found that 87 percent of over 1,000 American workers across industries experienced post-vacation stress and anxiety, which the company named “P.T.O. woes,” and that 72 percent of workers refrained from taking vacation at all to avoid that stress. Psychologists and therapists classify post-vacation angst as anticipatory anxiety, a generic term to describe fear and worry about bad things that might happen in the future.
Dr. Rebecca Brendal, president of the American Psychiatric Association, likened the experience to the Sunday scaries, a term that has become popular on social media to refer to the dread one feels at the end of the weekend about going back to work. It is a cause for concern during this holiday season because it dovetails with a sharp increase in burnout among workers in recent months, she said.

“We know that mental health concerns are up and anxiety is up. The stress that Americans are facing every day has gotten to the point that taking time off has become stressful,” Dr. Brendal said.
In one widely cited study, published in 2000, researchers found that vacationing every year reduced overall risk of death. Brooks Gump, a professor of public health at Syracuse University and a co-author of that paper, ran a similar study last year. He and his team found that while workers with low-stress jobs felt calmer and less anxious before, during and after a vacation, those feelings didn’t seem to extend to those in high-stress jobs."

Re “Growing Network of Conservative Groups Is Fueling Book Bans” (front page, Dec. 13):
Do these parents really believe that the moral code they teach to their children is so fragile that the presence of a book on a library shelf will threaten it? Do they take no responsibility for talking with their children about the diversity of life and how their personal morals fit in?
A personal moral code is complex, and the most powerful influence is from the home. But even then no one can force anyone to believe something that does not fit their values or sense of self.
A book alone cannot force someone to behave in a manner that contradicts their morals. And banning books will not eliminate the ideas and voices of the people who wrote them. The ideas are out there in the conversations young people have every day.
The world is a diverse place. And eventually these “innocent children” will leave home and form their own moral code, sometimes despite what they may have been taught at home.
No one can protect their children from everything. And that is a good thing. Children need to be prepared to deal with a complicated world, and they can’t do that if they are shielded by fear and hate from ideas with which they disagree.

If you’re one of those people who bought Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency near its peak last fall, you’ve lost a lot of money. Is it any consolation to know that you would have lost a similar amount if you had bought Tesla stock instead?
OK, probably not. Still, Tesla stock’s plunge is an opportunity to talk about what makes businesses successful in the information age. And in the end, Tesla and Bitcoin may have more in common than you think.
It’s natural to attribute Tesla’s recent decline — which is, to be sure, part of a general fall in tech stocks, but an exceptionally steep example — to Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter and the reputational self-immolation that followed. Indeed, given what we’ve seen of Musk’s behavior, I wouldn’t trust him to feed my cat, let alone run a major corporation. Furthermore, Tesla sales have surely depended at least in part on the perception that Musk himself is a cool guy. Who, aside from MAGA types who probably wouldn’t have bought Teslas anyway, sees him that way now?
On the other hand, as someone who has spent much of his professional life in academia, I’m familiar with the phenomenon of people who are genuinely brilliant in some areas but utter fools in other domains. For all I know, Musk is or was a highly effective leader at Tesla and SpaceX.

Even if that’s the case, though, it’s hard to explain the huge valuation the market put on Tesla before the drop, or even its current value. After all, to be that valuable, Tesla would have to generate huge profits not just for a few years but in a way that could be expected to continue for many years to come.
Now, some technology companies have indeed been long-term moneymaking machines. Apple and Microsoft still top the list of the most profitable U.S. corporations some four decades after the rise of personal computers."

Microsoft’s $69 billion bid for the video game company Activision Blizzard was the year’s biggest deal.

Jae C. Hong/Associated Press
Heading into 2022, Wall Street’s deal-makers thought it would be hard to maintain last year’s record-breaking pace for mergers and acquisitions. Still, few thought their businesses would fall by too much.
But the M.&A. business hit turbulence in the middle of the year and hasn’t recovered.
Activity held up compared with historical trends, with about 53,863 deals worth $3.6 trillion announced in 2022, according to Refinitiv, but dropped sharply in the second half of the year. And while the yearly total pales in comparison with 2021’s $5.7 trillion worth of transactions, it’s in line with the value and number of takeovers announced in the previous six years.
“I would sum it up as significantly less activity than in 2021,” said Marco Caggiano, the head of North American M.&A. at JPMorgan Chase. “But because 2021 was historically at such a high level, 2022 looks like a more normalized level of volume.”
Perhaps the bigger question is how things look for next year. Bankers, lawyers and private equity executives suggest that, for all the challenges they faced this year, there are reasons to be optimistic about 2023.

Economic headwinds intensified
Deal-makers like to say that the mergers business is built on corporate confidence. At the start of 2022, the rising markets, strong corporate profits and cheap debt that powered last year’s surge in transactions appeared likely to stick around. Microsoft’s $69 billion bid for the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, the biggest takeover of 2022, was unveiled just a few weeks into the year. (That deal now faces challenges from the United States; more on that below.) Indeed, four of the five biggest deals this year, including Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter, were announced before May.
All that was before a potent combination of economic developments — volatile markets, rising inflation, climbing interest rates and geopolitical instability spurred by factors such as the war in Ukraine — shook company boards’ willingness to take risks.
Financing became more complicated
Rattled nerves didn’t only affect corporate directors and management teams. Banks that helped finance takeovers were increasingly unable to sell on the debt to other investors, leaving them with billions of dollars stuck on their books. (Lenders to Mr. Musk for his Twitter deal have had to hold on to about $12.5 billion worth of loans, hoping to avoid booking huge losses by selling them now.)
That jolt to a crucial part of deal-making unnerved would-be buyers and sellers. “We don’t need low interest rates for a robust M.&A. market, but we need a predictable, stable financing market,” said Stephan Feldgoise, a co-head of global M.&A. at Goldman Sachs.
David Sambur, a co-head of private equity at the investment giant Apollo Global Management, added that while many had anticipated more difficulties in obtaining financing this year, “the speed of it, I think, surprised a lot of people.”
Harder-to-get financing had a pronounced effect on private equity firms, which historically rely on cheap debt to power their transactions. About 11,405 deals backed by the sector, worth about $780.5 billion, were announced this year, down 24.6 percent by volume compared with 2021.
Uncertainty over financing, coupled with choppy markets and economic uncertainty, introduced another hurdle: valuation, as buyers and sellers disagreed over how much target companies were worth. In some instances, those disputes froze deal-making altogether. “For companies that are well funded, there’s no need or imperative to do anything,” Mr. Feldgoise said.

Government challenges grew louder

Not all obstacles arose from economic factors. Government regulators have taken a tougher line against big deals, particularly in the United States. Both Lina Khan of the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter at the Justice Department’s antitrust division have sought to widen the grounds on which they could challenge transactions — even if they lose some cases along the way.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
In some ways, that more interventionist approach catches up to the attitude of regulators in Britain and the European Union.
That shift in philosophy led the F.T.C. to sue to block Microsoft’s takeover of Activision, a deal that under prevailing antitrust standards probably wouldn’t be seen to substantially harm competition. But Ms. Khan has argued that approach ignores the effects of big mergers on issues like innovation, particularly as corporate titans become bigger.
Still, some deal-makers played down the risks that heightened antitrust scrutiny would have for boards and executives looking to do an acquisition, since most will still get done — it just might take longer.
“People will need to adjust their strategy,” said Antonio Bavasso, a partner and antitrust specialist at the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. “Are they willing to litigate to take their deals through?”

SPACs had a rough year
One part of the M.&A. market suffered an especially sharp decline: special purpose acquisition companies, known as SPACs or blank-check funds, which raise money in the public markets to buy privately held companies.
Just as quickly as SPACs surged in popularity in 2020 and 2021, so they fell out of favor this year: 170 such funds were raised, a 75 percent decline from last year, according to Refinitiv. Perhaps more important, the number of announced SPAC mergers fell 22 percent, to 226, while the number of canceled SPAC combinations more than doubled, to 55.
The reasons for the cooling off, experts say, include closer scrutiny of blank-check funds’ governance, as well as the relatively poor performance of companies that have gone public by merging with SPACs. Investors in these funds have also increasingly demanded to get their money back, reducing the overall amount of capital available to the companies that combine with SPACs.
“Redemptions and post-close trading performance are real headwinds to continued M.&A. volume in the sector,” said Mr. Caggiano of JPMorgan. “I think people look at that and say, ‘If I go down that route, the SPAC isn’t really going to bring much capital to the table.’”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
What lies ahead?
Despite all those challenges, M.&A. advisers (who tend to be a largely optimistic lot) believe there’s reason to hope for a respectable 2023. Among them is the fact that many companies want to expand or shift their business strategies, and doing a deal is often the best or easiest way of doing so.
That doesn’t necessarily mean a uniform pace of deal-making. Mr. Caggiano expects 2023 to start off slowly before ratcheting up, in a reverse of 2022. But he and others believe that mergers activity should remain fairly robust.
“The strategic imperatives that came out of Covid — repositioning, scale, onshoring — none of those have changed,” said Mr. Feldgoise of Goldman. “Boards are saying, ‘I want to fortress my company.’”

And even the challenges that 2022 has presented shouldn’t be, well, deal breakers. Take higher financing costs: “The cost of money now is essentially normal. The world we were living in previously, that was abnormal,” said Mr. Sambur of Apollo. “It’s not like deals can’t work with financing costs where they are.”
Or consider antitrust enforcement. Mr. Bavasso of Simpson Thacher said regulators were unlikely to let up, particularly in the United States, as the likes of Ms. Khan continue trying to rewrite the rules of antitrust by challenging deals.
But Mr. Feldgoise predicted many companies would weigh the risks of antitrust action against a host of other considerations. “It’s been a factor in every administration, but it’s one of several factors as it always has been,” he said.
Ultimately, companies and private equity firms intent on doing deals are going to carry on hunting — and the turbulence of today’s landscape may even yield bargains. “In our experience, our best performing funds are funds that we deploy during recessions and market downturns,” said Matt Nord, Apollo’s other co-head of private equity. “The more stress there is in the system, the bigger the pipeline of opportunities there are for us.”

2022-12-31,"At 19, when I began drafting my webcomic, I had just been flung into adulthood. I felt a little awkward, a little displaced. The glittering veneer of social media, which back then was mostly Facebook, told me that everyone around me had their lives together while I felt like a withering ball of mediocrity. But surely, I believed, I could not be the only one who felt that life was mostly an uphill battle of difficult moments and missed social cues.
I started my webcomic back in 2011, before “relatable” humor was as ubiquitous online as it is today. At the time, the comics were overtly simple, often drawn shakily in Microsoft Paint or poorly scanned sketchbook pages. The jokes were less punchline-oriented and more of a question: Do you feel this way too? I wrote about the small daily struggles of missed clock alarms, ill-fitting clothes and cringe-worthy moments.
I had hoped, at most, for a small, niche following, but to my elation, I had viral success. My first comic to reach a sizable audience was about simply not wanting to get up in the morning, and it was met with a chorus of “this is so me.” I felt as if I had my finger on the pulse of the collective underdog. To have found this way of communicating with others and to make it my work was, and remains, among the greatest gifts and privileges of my life.
But the attention was not all positive. In late 2016, I caught the eye of someone on the 4chan board /pol/. There was no particular incident that prompted the harassment, but in hindsight, I was a typical target for such groups. I am a woman, the messaging in the comics is feminist leaning, and importantly, the simplicity of my work makes it easy to edit and mimic. People on the forum began reproducing my work and editing it to reflect violently racist messages advocating genocide and Holocaust denial, complete with swastikas and the introduction of people getting pushed into ovens. The images proliferated online, with sites like Twitter and Reddit rarely taking them down.
A recent example of my work
Image
For my comics, I keep things simple — punchy drawings, minimal text — because I like my ideas to be immediately accessible. I write a lot about day-to-day life. My pets, their personality quirks and my love for them are common themes.
The ways my images were altered were crude, but a few were convincing. Through the bombardment of my social media with these images, the alt-right created a shadow version of me, a version that advocated neo-Nazi ideology. At times people fell for it. I received outraged messages and had to contact my publisher to make my stance against this ultraclear. I started receiving late-night calls and had to change my number, and I got the distinct impression that the alt-right wanted a public meltdown.

2023-01-03,"Organized labor claimed one of its biggest victories at a U.S. tech company on Tuesday, gaining a foothold among about 300 employees at a video game maker owned by Microsoft.
The Communications Workers of America, which will represent the employees, announced the result, and Microsoft issued a statement recognizing the outcome.
“We look forward to engaging in good faith negotiations as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement,” the company said. Microsoft has no other unionized workers.
The unionization move at the video game maker, ZeniMax Media, which Microsoft acquired for about $7.5 billion in a deal that closed in 2021, did not involve a conventional union election run by the National Labor Relations Board.

Instead, the company allowed workers to express their preferences in two ways: They could sign a union authorization card, which some began doing in November, or they could vote anonymously through an online platform that was open during most of December.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
The process was more efficient and less contentious than the run-up to a typical labor board election, which can involve extensive legal wrangling.
Microsoft agreed to remain neutral throughout the union campaign, avoiding the anti-union meetings and messaging that many companies engage in. The concessions came as the company has been trying to placate antitrust regulators who are scrutinizing its roughly $70 billion proposed acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard.
“This is an empowering victory that allows us to protect ourselves and each other in a way we never could without a union,” Skylar Hinnant, a worker involved in the organizing campaign, said in a statement.

When workers at a vast Amazon warehouse on Staten Island pushed to organize last year, the company fought the effort aggressively. The union prevailed in April, but Amazon has challenged the results. Apple has also sought to persuade retail workers against unionizing, though workers at two stores have voted to do so.

ZeniMax employees involved in the campaign, which included only quality assurance, or Q.A., workers, said Microsoft’s neutral stance came as a relief. “It was nothing short of an absolute gift,” Autumn Mitchell, a worker active in the union effort, said during an interview last month.

In a further sign that unionization is gaining traction across the gaming industry, workers at a Boston studio owned by Activision announced last week that they had filed a petition to hold a union election.
Two other Activision studios have already voted to unionize — one in Wisconsin and the other near Albany, N.Y. But unlike those studios, the proposed union at the Boston studio, known as Proletariat, includes a variety of workers, such as animators, designers and engineers, not just Q.A. workers. A formal union with broader membership would appear to be a first at a major U.S. game maker.
The Communications Workers of America represents workers at the two Activision studios that have already unionized and would represent the Boston-based workers.

At ZeniMax, which includes the high-profile Bethesda Game Studios, maker of such hits as The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, workers said they hoped a union would improve their pay and hours. Q.A. testers and other workers in the industry have long complained that they must endure grueling stretches of work shortly before a title is released.
Microsoft has said it consults with employees to ensure they don’t take on too much work.
Those seeking to unionize at ZeniMax also said that they hoped to change the company’s approach to promoting workers and to assigning them more responsibility, which they said seemed arbitrary at times, and that they hoped to be able to negotiate more flexible policies on remote work.
In June, Microsoft announced a deal with the communications workers union in which it promised to stay neutral if any of Activision’s U.S. employees sought to unionize after Microsoft acquired the company. The video game maker has about 7,000 U.S. employees, most of whom are eligible to unionize.
Officially, the labor deal applied only to employees who joined Microsoft through the Activision purchase. But the tech giant indicated that it would be open to extending the terms of the labor deal to current employees as well.
The politically powerful communications workers union had voiced reservations about Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision, but it said the neutrality agreement addressed its concerns, and the union’s president later met with the chair of the Federal Trade Commission to urge support for the deal.
But regulators have not been appeased. The agency filed suit to block the Activision transaction in December, just as ZeniMax workers were deciding whether to unionize."

The vote for House speaker is the kind of government procedure that Americans often ignore, but yesterday’s highly unusual votes have important implications for the future of the Republican Party and how it will govern.
On their first day in the majority, House Republicans couldn’t agree on who will lead them. Representative Kevin McCarthy has sought for years to become speaker, but some members of his party’s far-right faction refused to back him. It was the first time in 100 years that the House failed to elect a speaker on the first ballot, and lawmakers adjourned after three ballots without making a choice. The Democratic House leader, Hakeem Jeffries, even received more votes than McCarthy in all three rounds of voting.
Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right lawmaker who has become a close ally of McCarthy’s, accused her fellow hard-liners of “playing Russian roulette with our hard-earned Republican majority.” Bill Huizenga, another McCarthy supporter, asked his colleagues, “You guys aren’t interested in governing?”
Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who had endorsed McCarthy, refused to say after the votes if he was sticking to his endorsement. (McCarthy later said that he had talked to Trump and still had his support.)
Part of McCarthy’s problem is that his party holds a narrow margin in the House, with 222 seats to Democrats’ 212. So he requires support from Republicans’ right-wing flank to reach the majority he needs to be speaker. But that is only part of the story.
Republicans also don’t agree on what the party is and what it should stand for: Should it continue down the path that Trump began when he won the Republican nomination for president in 2016? Or should the party moderate and embrace more compromise to consolidate power?

2023-01-05,"In a far-reaching move that could raise wages and increase competition among businesses, the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday unveiled a rule that would block companies from limiting their employees’ ability to work for a rival.
The proposed rule would ban provisions of labor contracts known as noncompete agreements, which prevent workers from leaving for a competitor or starting a competing business for months or years after their employment, often within a certain geographic area. The agreements have applied to workers as varied as sandwich makers, hairstylists, doctors and software engineers.
Studies show that noncompetes, which appear to directly affect roughly 20 percent to 45 percent of U.S. workers in the private sector, hold down pay because job switching is one of the more reliable ways of securing a raise. Many economists believe they help explain why pay for middle-income workers has stagnated in recent decades.
Other studies show that noncompetes protect established companies from start-ups, reducing competition within industries. The arrangements may also harm productivity by making it hard for companies to hire workers who best fit their needs.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The F.T.C. proposal is the latest in a series of aggressive and sometimes unorthodox moves to rein in the power of large companies under the agency’s chair, Lina Khan.
President Biden hailed the proposal on Thursday, saying that noncompete clauses “are designed simply to lower people’s wages.”
“These agreements block millions of retail workers, construction workers and other working folks from taking a better job, getting better pay and benefits, in the same field,” he said at a cabinet meeting.
The public will be allowed to submit comments on the proposal for 60 days, at which point the agency will move to make it final. An F.T.C. document said the rule would take effect 180 days after the final version was published, but experts said it could face legal challenges.
The agency estimated that the rule could increase wages by nearly $300 billion a year across the economy. Evan Starr, an economist at the University of Maryland who has studied noncompetes, said that was a plausible wage increase after their elimination.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Dr. Starr said noncompetes appeared to lower wages both for workers directly covered by them and for other workers, partly by making the hiring process more costly for employers, who must spend time figuring out whom they can hire and whom they can’t.
He pointed to research showing that wages tended to be higher in states that restrict noncompetes. One study found that wages for newly hired tech workers in Hawaii increased by about 4 percent after the state banned noncompetes for those workers. In Oregon, where new noncompetes became unenforceable for low-wage workers in 2008, the change appeared to raise the wages of hourly workers by 2 percent to 3 percent.
Although noncompetes appear to be more common among more highly paid and more educated workers, many companies have used them for low-wage hourly workers and even interns.
About half of states significantly constrain the use of noncompetes, and a small number have deemed them largely unenforceable, including California.
But even in such states, companies often include noncompetes in employment contracts, and many workers in these states report turning down job offers partly as a result of the provisions, suggesting that these state regulations may have limited effects. Many workers in those states are not necessarily aware that the provisions are unenforceable, experts say.

“Research shows that employers’ use of noncompetes to restrict workers’ mobility significantly suppresses workers’ wages — even for those not subject to noncompetes, or subject to noncompetes that are unenforceable under state law,” Elizabeth Wilkins, the director of the F.T.C.’s office of policy planning, said in a statement.
The commission’s proposal appears to address this issue by requiring employers to withdraw existing noncompetes and to inform workers that they no longer apply. The proposal would also make it illegal for an employer to enter into a noncompete with a worker or to try to do so, or to suggest that a worker is bound by a noncompete when he or she is not.
The proposal covers not just employees but also independent contractors, interns, volunteers and other workers.

Defenders of noncompetes argue that employees are free to turn down a job if they want to preserve their ability to join another company, or that they can bargain for higher pay in return for accepting the restriction. Proponents also argue that noncompetes make employers more likely to invest in training and to share sensitive information with workers, which they might withhold if they feared that a worker might quickly leave.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A ban “ignores the fact that, when appropriately used, noncompete agreements are an important tool in fostering innovation,” Sean Heather, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
At least one study has found that greater enforcement of noncompetes leads to an increase in job creation by start-ups, though some of its conclusions are at odds with other research.
Dr. Starr said that noncompetes did appear to encourage businesses to invest more in training, but that there was little evidence that most employees entered into them voluntarily or that they were able to bargain over them. One study found that only 10 percent of workers sought to bargain for concessions in return for signing a noncompete. About one-third became aware of the noncompete only after accepting a job offer.
Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said that while there were good reasons to scale back noncompetes for lower-wage workers, the rationale was less clear for better-paid workers with specialized knowledge or skills.
“If your job is to make minor tweaks to the formula for Coca-Cola and you’re one of 25 people on earth who knows the formula,” Dr. Strain said, speaking hypothetically, “it makes total sense that Coca-Cola might say, ‘We don’t want you to go work for Pepsi.’”

He said that it might be possible to satisfy an employer’s concerns with a less blunt tool, like a nondisclosure agreement, but that the evidence for this was lacking.
In a video call with reporters on Wednesday, Ms. Khan said she believed the F.T.C. had clear authority to issue the rule, noting that federal law empowers the agency to prohibit “unfair methods of competition.”
But Kristen Limarzi, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who previously served as a senior official in the antitrust division of the Justice Department, said she believed such a rule could be vulnerable to a legal challenge. Opponents would probably argue that the relevant federal statute is too vague to guide the agency in putting forth a rule banning noncompetes, she said, and that the evidence the agency has on their effects is still too limited to support a rule.
At the helm of the F.T.C. since last year, Ms. Khan has tried to use the agency’s authority in untested ways to rein in the power and influence of corporate giants. In doing so, she and her allies hope to reverse a turn in recent decades toward more conservative antitrust law — a shift that they say enabled runaway concentration, limited options for consumers and squeezed small businesses.
Ms. Khan has brought lawsuits in recent months to block Meta, Facebook’s parent company, from buying a virtual reality start-up and Microsoft from buying the video game publisher Activision Blizzard. Both cases employ less common legal arguments that are likely to face heavy scrutiny from courts. But Ms. Khan has indicated she is willing to lose cases if the agency ends up taking more risks.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ms. Khan and her counterpart at the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Jonathan Kanter, have also said they want to increase the focus of the nation’s antitrust agencies on empowering workers. Last year, the Justice Department successfully blocked Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster using the argument that the deal would lower compensation for authors.
One question looming over the discussion of noncompetes is what effect banning them may have on prices during a period of high inflation, given that limiting noncompetes tends to raise wages.
But the experience of the past two years, when rates of quitting and job-hopping have been unusually high, suggests that noncompetes may not currently be as big an obstacle to worker mobility as they have traditionally been. Partly as a result, banning them may not have much of a short-term effect on wages.
Instead, some economists say, the more pronounced effect of a ban may come in the intermediate and long term, once the job market softens and workers no longer have as much leverage. At that point, noncompetes could begin to weigh more heavily on job switching and wages again.
“Doing something like this is a way to help sustain the increase in worker power over the last couple of years,” said Heidi Shierholz, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, who was chief economist at the Labor Department during the Obama administration.

Bed Bath & Beyond is suffering from a huge debt load.

John Taggart for The New York Times
Bed Bath & Beyond’s time is running out
In 2021, Bed Bath & Beyond joined the list of meme stocks whose share prices surged amid sudden interest from online retail investors. But the home furnishings retailer’s future is uncertain after a disappointing holiday sales season failed to help solve its worsening financial woes.
Bed Bath & Beyond is now weighing a variety of options, including raising cash by selling parts of its business or all of the company. But if those efforts fail, its only option may be to file for bankruptcy.
The retailer’s holiday season was exceedingly grim. Bed Bath & Beyond forecast a potential $386 million loss for its latest quarter, down 40 percent from the same time in 2021. The company also had a negative cash flow of $340 million last year and paid $65 million in interest. As of March, it had about $3 billion in debt. While the retailer is working on an ambitious turnaround plan, that requires time and money it may not have.
Raising money is getting harder for troubled companies. Thanks to rising interest rates, new loans are much more expensive, while institutional investors who were happy to buy the debt of riskier businesses during boom times are now picking only safe bets. Meanwhile, volatile stock markets have made issuing new equity difficult for many companies, an especially big problem for meme-stock companies that relied heavily on issuing new shares to finance their growth.
All of this is bad news for Bed Bath & Beyond:

The retailer took out a $375 million loan from Sixth Street in August, and it’s unclear whether the investment firm is interested in lending more.
The company had also tried to exchange some of its bonds for new equity, but that offer expired on Wednesday. That the retailer still has a huge debt load suggests that its creditors favor owning the company’s bonds to have a higher priority in a Chapter 11 case than if they had swapped their holdings for equity.
Bed Bath & Beyond isn’t the only meme-stock name in trouble. The movie theater chain AMC has seen its shares tumble 85 percent over the past year, while the video game retailer GameStop has fallen 50 percent.
The companies all face similar problems, according to David Trainer, the C.E.O. of the investment research firm New Constructs: “They don’t have enough pretax profit to pay their interest payments,” he told DealBook, adding that they have negative cash flow and no more than 24 months of cash-flow runway.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Representative Kevin McCarthy redoubles his efforts to win over right-wing holdouts. As the Republican leader lost an 11th ballot for speaker yesterday, he negotiated with dissidents on a potential deal that could drastically weaken his authority if he’s eventually elected. There may be movement toward an agreement, but it’s unclear whether or when one can be reached.
U.S. jobs data may show slowing growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the December employment data at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that roughly 200,000 jobs were added last month, keeping the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent. Investors and the Fed will be watching average hourly earnings growth, an inflationary indicator.
Tesla cuts prices in China for a second time in less than three months. The move came after the carmaker reported a sharp fall in sales in its second-biggest market last month, behind only the United States, as it faces tougher competition from Chinese rivals like BYD. Tesla also lowered some prices in Australia, Japan and South Korea.
Samsung profits fall to an eight-year low. The electronics giant said its operating profit fell 69 percent in its most recent quarter, battered by curbed demand for semiconductors and other tech goods like smartphones and TVs. Samsung also suffered from a glut in the computer chip market, particularly memory chips, which analysts say will probably persist.
The N.F.L. cancels the game postponed after Damar Hamlin collapsed.

More important, Hamlin is now awake, able to move his hands and feet and can write, his doctors said.

The F.T.C.’s new war on noncompetes
Since becoming chair of the F.T.C., Lina Khan has embarked on a series of aggressive moves to expand federal competition oversight, including by suing to block prominent mergers.
But Ms. Khan is taking on one of her most ambitious challenges yet: calling for an end to noncompete agreements that limit workers’ ability to join rival companies or start a competitive businesses. The effort could lift workers’ wages, Ms. Khan argues, but opponents say that the agency is overreaching.

The use of noncompetes has swelled over the years. Often regarded as more commonly applying to highly paid workers like software engineers, the contract provisions appear to affect up to 45 percent of private sector workers, including sandwich makers, hairstylists and interns.
The F.T.C. and supporters of its effort say such clauses limit workers’ pay because they prevent people from switching jobs and make hiring more costly for employers who have to figure out whom they can and can’t hire. Banning them, the agency contends, could lift wages by nearly $300 billion a year; some academic research shows that wages have risen in states that have limited their use.
But defenders of noncompetes argue that they make employers more likely to invest in worker training and share sensitive information. They also contend that workers could turn down jobs that require noncompetes or ask for higher pay in return.
Expect a battle over the F.T.C.’s jurisdiction. Ms. Khan — who isn’t afraid of picking fights she may lose if they lead to expansions of regulatory power — told reporters that federal law empowers the agency to prohibit unfair methods of competition. (At least one Republican commissioner at the F.T.C., however, appears to favor a narrower approach.)
Corporate trade groups argue that the legal grounds for such a rule are questionable. “Congress has never delegated the F.T.C. anything close to the authority it would need to promulgate such a competition rule,” a top official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said yesterday. Legal experts expect lawsuits to challenge any final rule that’s approved.

A widening crisis in crypto
The fallout from the collapse of FTX is expanding as a growing number of crypto businesses face regulatory scrutiny or report that they’re struggling financially. Here’s a roundup of the latest news:
Silvergate’s shares plunged after a run on the bank. The crypto-focused bank’s stock fell nearly 43 percent yesterday after disclosing $8.1 billion in deposit withdrawals last quarter, forcing it to sell assets at a loss. It also wrote down $196 million spent buying technology from Diem Group, the blockchain payments project created by Facebook, and halted plans to release its own digital currency.
A founder of Celsius is accused of defrauding investors. New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, sued Alex Mashinsky, the failed crypto lender’s former C.E.O., accusing him of trying to defraud hundreds of thousands of investors by falsely claiming that his company’s platform was as safe as a traditional bank. Celsius filed for bankruptcy over the summer, leaving its customers with billions of dollars in lost deposits; the company said Mr. Mashinsky is no longer involved in its management.
Genesis laid off about a third of its workers and is contemplating bankruptcy. The embattled brokerage took steep losses from loans it made to Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research and the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Meanwhile, its parent company, Digital Currency Group, is trying to raise capital to pay back creditors, and its founder, Barry Silbert, is also feuding publicly with the crypto exchange Gemini.
The layoff contagion
Tech giants are cutting their workforces, and Wall Street banks are preparing to lay off thousands in the coming weeks. The companies blame overhiring during the pandemic, economic headwinds and the end of a deal-making and fund-raising boom.
Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, has another theory: copycat behavior. “Why would you expect, in a world in which we know from a ton of research for a variety of behaviors that that behavior is imitated, that this is the one behavior that would not be imitated and socially influenced?” he told DealBook.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Layoffs are expensive, Pfeffer said. Decades of research also show that layoffs aren’t always effective. But Mr. Pfeffer says companies imitate what their peers are doing rather than making evidence-based decisions. This is happening in the tech sector, he adds, where companies are insisting they need to cut costs despite having a lot of money.
If companies cut staff — say, because of a dip in deal flow or advertising revenue — they’ll most likely have to make hefty severance payments. But they will also eventually have to hire again, spending on recruiting fees, hiring bonuses and onboarding costs. And they often employ laid-off workers as contractors as well.
When companies in a sector carry out layoffs and then go on hiring sprees in sync, recruitment becomes more competitive, too. “It’s like buying high and selling low, which never struck me as a smart thing to do,” Mr. Pfeffer said.

And downsizing doesn’t necessarily bolster the bottom line. A 2015 analysis of 55 studies on how layoffs affect financial performance found that “downsizing often does not yield anticipated beneﬁts and that there is limited consensus among researchers on whether employee downsizing creates value.”

Steve Easterbrook, the former McDonald’s C.E.O., cannot serve as director of a public company for five years.

McDonald’s ex-C.E.O. pays for his firing scandal
Three years after being fired as McDonald’s C.E.O. over what was eventually revealed as several inappropriate personal relationships with employees, Steve Easterbrook on Monday agreed to punishments from the S.E.C. over how his termination played out.
The agency’s accusations are a major milestone in a scandal that gripped corporate America, as the fast-food giant accused its former chief of misleading internal investigators. But they’re also the latest sign of how the S.E.C. is seeking to hold companies to account for what they do — and don’t — reveal to investors.
The S.E.C.’s case revolved around disclosure. The regulator said Easterbrook misled investors about the reasons for his termination. McDonald’s initially said he was terminated “without cause” for having what he said was a consensual relationship with an employee, and allowed him to leave with a separation package worth about $40 million. The company, however, later uncovered other relationships that Easterbrook hadn’t disclosed and sued him.
“By allegedly concealing the extent of his misconduct during the company’s internal investigation, Easterbrook broke that trust with — and ultimately misled — shareholders,” Gurbir Grewal, the director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, said in a statement.

Easterbrook will be barred from serving as a public company executive or director for five years, and will also pay a $400,000 fine. McDonald’s didn’t pay a penalty because it cooperated with the S.E.C. For its part, the company noted that it had already taken action against Easterbrook, including firing him and clawing back compensation.
The S.E.C.’s move drew criticism from within. The regulator’s two Republican commissioners said the agency appeared to question expanding its regulatory powers through enforcement. “The order casts McDonald’s, the victim of Mr. Easterbrook’s deception, as a securities law violator through a novel interpretation of the Commission’s expansive executive compensation disclosure requirements,” they said.
It’s the latest instance of criticism facing federal regulators over whether they’re overstepping their bounds by effectively writing new rules.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Microsoft reportedly weighs a $10 billion investment in the parent of ChatGPT. The tech giant is in talks to pour more money into OpenAI, along with other venture investors, according to Semafor. Microsoft had previously invested in OpenAI and is said to be planning to incorporate ChatGPT into products like its Bing search engine.
House Republicans eke out another legislative win. They narrowly approved an overhaul of the House’s operating rules, overcoming concerns by moderates about concessions made to the hard right to help Speaker Kevin McCarthy clinch his job. Republicans also voted to cut funding for the I.R.S., but the move is unlikely to pass the Senate.
Disney requires employees to work in the office four days a week. The edict by Bob Iger, the company’s newly returned C.E.O., is a relatively strict return-to-office policy compared with most in corporate America. It’s among the many big overhauls that Iger is likely to make at Disney, which may also include layoffs.
Another Sam Bankman-Fried associate reportedly meets with prosecutors. Nishad Singh, who previously led engineering at FTX, has held talks over a potential cooperation agreement with the Justice Department, according to Bloomberg. If he secures a deal, he would join Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang in working against Bankman-Fried.

Growing opposition to the F.T.C.’s noncompete move
The F.T.C.’s proposal to ban noncompete agreements is among the agency’s most sweeping moves in recent years, and it would have far-reaching consequences if it takes effect. But the move has also given business lobbyists an opportunity: a chance to challenge the agency’s power in court.
“We’ve been preparing for this moment, whether it was this issue or another,” Sean Heather, a senior vice president of international regulatory affairs and antitrust at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told DealBook. “It has nothing to do with the subject matter, but we don’t think they have the authority.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A big question is whether Congress gave the F.T.C. this authority. Some skeptics — including Noah Phillips, a Republican former commissioner at the regulator — argue that lawmakers didn’t give the agency the power to write new rules.
But antitrust experts note that a 1973 federal court decision — National Petroleum Refiners Association v. F.T.C. — did grant rule-making power. That legal decision allowed it to require businesses to post octane ratings on gas pumps. The rule, still in place today, was able to stand because it addressed a public harm, and Congress didn’t explicitly limit the F.T.C.’s rule-making power.

But a lot has changed since then. Antitrust experts across the political spectrum say courts now don’t tend to find agency authority where it’s not explicitly granted. Last June, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority ruled in West Virginia v. E.P.A. that the environmental agency overstepped its authority by creating emissions regulations that touch on “major questions” with big economic consequences.
That “major questions doctrine” had once been considered a fringe conservative legal position. Now, however, it’s become a key part of litigation strategy for industrial groups looking to fight new regulatory rules.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Even supporters of the F.T.C.’s move are wary. The regulator will most likely modify its proposal based on public comments made over a 60-day period, so no final rule will be issued for some time. Even then, whatever the agency does must still pass legal muster.
“That might be an uphill battle, given the way judges — particularly conservative judges — think,” Jon Leibowitz, a Democratic former F.T.C. chair, told DealBook. “It’s not a Hail Mary, but it’s definitely a shot down the field.”
Bed Bath and debts
Moments ago, Bed Bath & Beyond reported earnings, and there’s one question on nearly everyone’s mind: Can the retailer avoid bankruptcy after raising its own doubts about its financial health?
The company is looking for new capital, and its share price surged Monday on investor speculation that it could be an acquisition target. Given all of that, it’s worth analyzing how the home goods retailer got into this position.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Bed Bath & Beyond isn’t a typical retailer debt story. Most recent retail bankruptcies came after a boom in private equity deals in the sector over the previous decade. The acquisitions of companies like Toys “R” Us, the shoe chain Payless and the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus saddled them with debt, on the assumption that they could rely on steady cash flow to kick-start growth. But those mountains of debt became a noose that left those retailers unable to compete against the rise of Amazon.
But Bed Bath & Beyond started taking on significant debt in 2014, selling $1.5 billion in bonds to buy back stock, which one analyst described at the time as a “seminal event.”. (It was still far less than what would be attached to a typical leveraged buyout, however.) Thanks to cheap credit and the company’s status as a retail giant, it got a good deal on that debt: Those bonds had maturation dates of 10, 20 and 30 years with interest rates of 3.8 percent, 4.9 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, according to James Gellert, the C.E.O. of the financial analytics firm RapidRatings.
Those were terms Bed Bath & Beyond could “only dream of” at any other time, Gellert told DealBook.

Rising competition and disappointing sales have hammered the company. While the retailer once stood strongly on its own after its competitor Linens ’n Things collapsed, management struggled to figure out the right strategy to compete with Kohl’s, Amazon and Target. Its supply chain management was hit hard by a shopping shift brought on by the pandemic. As a result, delivery times got extended, and costs increased. As its earnings disappeared, cash went to plugging its losses and its leverage skyrocketed. Bed Bath & Beyond’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization jumped to 6.19 in 2020 from 1.95 in 2019. “Ultimately, if you look at the debt level,” said Christina Boni, a senior vice president of Corporate Finance at Moody’s. “It’s more a function of the decline in profitability, more than anything else.”
Taking on more leverage hasn’t solved the problem. Bed Bath & Beyond tapped the debt market again in August, giving it a lifeline, and the hope that vendors would have enough confidence in the company to keep its shelves stocked during the holiday season. But it’s still struggled in recent months to procure the products customers wanted, and to sell enough of what it had.
The retailer, whose stock market capitalization has dropped to $190 million from a peak of $17 billion in 2013, could skip debt payments on Feb. 1. “Multiple paths are being explored, and we are determining our next steps thoroughly, and in a timely manner,” Susan Gove, the C.E.O. who launched a turnaround plan just months ago, said this morning.

Europe is suddenly a hot place to invest
A cost-of-living crisis, recession fears and a war raging on its eastern border: At first glance, Europe would hardly seem to be a go-to region for investors. But Wall Street increasingly sees an opportunity — particularly when compared with the U.S.
The latest economic data point to a shallow downturn. Investors got another spurt of upbeat news on Monday, with eurozone unemployment hitting a record low and factory output rising in Germany, the engine of the bloc’s economy.
Analysts are taking note. Last week, Citigroup raised its rating on European equities to overweight, saying valuations were relatively cheap. At the same time, they cut their 2023 outlook on U.S. stocks to underweight for the opposite reason: American shares are still too expensive.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Investors got the message months ago. European stocks have been outperforming American equities for several months. The benchmark Pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 10 percent last quarter and Germany’s DAX gained nearly 15 percent. At the same time, the S&P 500 climbed 7.5 percent.
Companies on both sides of the Atlantic are facing similar headwinds. Inflation remains at a multi-decade high, central banks are raising interest rates, recession seems likely, and that will probably torpedo corporate profits. Goldman Sachs predicts earnings per share for S&P 500 companies will flatline this year and Liberum Capital forecasts a volley of downgrades.
Europe may be over the worst and that’s enough for investors. This week, Goldman Sachs upgraded its forecast on eurozone G.D.P. to show meager growth for 2023, or a year-on-year gain of 0.6 percent versus an earlier prediction of a 0.1 percent slide. One big reason: energy prices have been falling across the bloc, with natural gas futures hitting a 12-month low as warmer winter temperatures have cooled off demand.
That’s lifting the sentiment of consumers and businesses. “After a modest winter recession, the eurozone economy will stabilize in spring and start to recover at an above-consensus pace thereafter,” Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg, wrote in a recent note to clients.

The activist investor Nelson Peltz wants a Disney board seat.

Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times
How Nelson Peltz picked his fight with Disney
Disney already faces enormous challenges, including ballooning costs at its streaming service and unclear C.E.O. succession plans. Now it faces a proxy fight from Nelson Peltz’s Trian, the activist investment firm known for taking on blue-chip companies like Procter & Gamble.
But while their fight became public on Wednesday — after Disney rejected Mr. Peltz’s bid for a board seat — tensions between the two sides have been growing for months. A Disney regulatory filing released this morning reveals how the House of Mouse came to clash with one of Wall Street’s top activist investors.
Last July, Peltz met with Disney’s then-C.E.O., Bob Chapek, at Disneyland Paris. At the time, Trian hadn’t yet invested in the company, but Mr. Chapek was under pressure: He had gotten Disney entangled in a political fight in Florida; its Disney+ streaming service was losing money; and he had alienated important Hollywood partners. Still, Disney had just renewed Mr. Chapek’s contract for three more years. Soon after, Mr. Peltz met with two Disney directors about potentially joining the board.
In August, another activist, Dan Loeb’s Third Point, disclosed a stake in Disney and proposed spinning off ESPN, buying Comcast’s stake in the streaming platform Hulu and adding more board members. Mr. Loeb reached a truce with Disney a month later, with the company naming the former Meta executive Carolyn Everson as a director.
In early November, Disney delivered a disastrous quarterly earnings report. Within days, Mr. Peltz called Mr. Chapek to start formal discussions between the two companies; they met on Nov 12. On Nov. 20, Disney fired Mr. Chapek and brought back his predecessor, Bob Iger. By then, Trian had about $800 million worth of Disney shares. Executives from Trian and Disney met for 30 minutes later that month, and Mr. Peltz made his pitch to join the board.
In early December, Mr. Peltz informed Disney of his intention to nominate himself for its board and pushed for a meeting. By the end of the month, the board finally agreed to a meeting with Mr. Peltz, but Mr. Iger told him it would have to wait until after he returned from yachting off the coast of New Zealand.
Earlier this week, Disney and Trian met for 45 minutes. Mr. Peltz noted that the company’s shares were at a near-eight-year low, and urged Disney to revamp its streaming business, refocus on growing profits, reinstate its dividend and identify a successor to Mr. Iger. Afterward, the company offered to make Mr. Peltz a “board observer” — but not a full director — and asked him to stop fighting publicly; the activist declined. Within days, Disney announced Mr. Peltz’s intentions, and Trian went public with its campaign.
Disney is hoping it can ward off Mr. Peltz. The newly revealed background of Trian’s challenge suggests that Disney has been shaking itself up — including by firing Mr. Chapek and reinstalling Mr. Iger — perhaps in part to deny Mr. Peltz grounds to describe himself as an agent of change. Mr. Iger remains popular among many investors and analysts for leading Disney to record financial results during his previous 15-year run as C.E.O.
It’s unclear whether that will be enough to convince investors. Though Mr. Peltz isn’t pushing for Mr. Iger to step down, he has repeatedly criticized the Disney chief for overpaying in his $71.3 billion takeover of 21st Century Fox. And Trian can point to its successful shake-ups of companies like P.&G. and General Electric, though revamping an entertainment giant is a new challenge.
In any case, investors should bring some popcorn and watch the fireworks.

What to watch for in today’s C.P.I. data
Economists are forecasting that the latest Consumer Price Index report for the United States, due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, will show a decline in inflation for a third straight month. Investors are now speculating that the data could make the Fed pivot on interest rates, and that the central bank may yet pull off its “soft landing” objective of lower prices without a recession. You can follow the Times’s coverage here.

A growing number of Wall Street analysts are feeling bullish about on Thursday’s reading. The consensus forecast on C.P.I. is that prices rose 6.5 percent on an annualized basis last month. That’s still well above the Fed’s target, but would represent a substantial improvement from June, when the so-called headline C.P.I. figure hit 9.1 percent, a 40-year high.
Assuming that the worst of inflation is over, investors have started moving back into both risky and stable assets: The Nasdaq has gained 7 percent in the past two weeks, while the yield on 10-year Treasury notes has fallen by more than 35 basis points in the same period.

Falling energy prices — gasoline prices fell 10 percent last month, according to RBC Capital Markets — and slumping car sales will likely have played roles in depressing the headline number, economists say. But the big question is whether wage gains in recent months have fueled so-called “service inflation,” or rising prices for things like travel, restaurants and entertainment.
“While we expect this deflation to continue as we head into 2023, the factors driving inflation have now switched to services inflation,” said Andrew Patterson, senior economist at Vanguard, in a note on Wednesday, adding that factor could keep core inflation above the Fed’s 2 percent target for much of the year.

Markets are still betting on smaller interest rate increases, and some Fed officials seem to be on the same page. Susan Collins, the president of the Boston Fed, told The Times’s Jeanna Smialek that she’s leaning toward a quarter-point rate increase at the central bank’s next rates-setting meeting — but only if data shows inflation is under control.
Corporate America’s get-to-work message for Washington
The traditionally tight bond between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Republicans has frayed in recent years. It weakened further after Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, reportedly suggested that the business lobbying group replace Suzanne Clark as C.E.O., as he sought conservative support for his pursuit of the House speakership.
Ms. Clark remains in place, however, and hasn’t backed off from challenging lawmakers. DealBook has gotten a preview of her annual State of American Business address, scheduled to be delivered at 11 a.m. Eastern; in it, she plans to call out both political parties.

“When it comes to Washington, the state of American business is fed up,” Ms. Clark plans to say. “Businesses don’t have the clarity or the certainty to plan past the next political cycle. It means our country won’t be able to advance an agenda that extends beyond two to four years, or pass the policies needed to position us for our future.”
But Ms. Clark won’t just chide lawmakers. She will also introduce an “agenda for American strength,” essentially a policy wish list. It includes:
Continuing a bipartisan approach that led to Congress approving $1 trillion in infrastructure spending. The Chamber hopes Republicans and Democrats can team up to overhaul permitting of energy infrastructure projects and approve offshore leasing for oil and gas projects.
Expanding access to employment-based visas, and fixing “the broken immigration system by securing the border” and protecting the undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.

The latest on layoffs
More companies announced job cuts on Wednesday as corporate America moves to shrink its work force in the face of challenging economic conditions. Here’s an update:
Goldman Sachs laid off more employees on Wednesday as part of a cost-cutting drive that involves reducing head count by 3,200. (Some workers were reportedly given as little as 30 minutes to pack up their desks, according to The Financial Times.) More are expected to leave after receiving bonuses that will be sharply lower than last year’s.
BlackRock will cut up to 500 jobs, in the asset-management giant’s first set of layoffs since 2019. The firm’s belief that an economic downturn is coming may be driving the move: “A recession is a matter of when, not if,” Gary Shedlin, BlackRock’s C.F.O., told analysts last month.
Verily, a health care division of Alphabet, plans to cut 200 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force. It’s the first in what is expected to be a round of layoffs at Google’s parent company.
Flexport, a start-up that produces supply-chain software, will lay off 640 workers, or 20 percent of its staff. Executives said a slowdown in shipping, tied to lower consumer demand, required cost-cutting measures.

Global crises are weighing on the World Economic Forum.

Hand-wringing in Davos
Andrew here. I’m attending the World Economic Forum with DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and a team from The Times to capture the mood and behind-the-scenes action among the world leaders and the C.E.O.s who’ve made their annual pilgrimage to the Swiss Alps.
Speaking of which: Davos is normally full of hand-wringing over the state of the world, but it feels especially pronounced this year. (That isn’t necessarily reflected in the crowd of corporate pop-ups on the Promenade, one of the town’s main thoroughfares, nor in the cocktail party schedule.)
The word of the event is “polycrisis,” a term we’ve been hearing in countless meetings and gatherings. The word — apparently coined in the 1990s, then used in 2016 by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission’s president at the time — now refers to the swirl of global emergencies that include economic slowdowns and rising inflation, the war in Ukraine and more.
The World Economic Forum itself has embraced the term in its annual report, citing the challenges that globalization, the beating heart of the conference, was meant to solve. Among them is climate change, a topic whose relevance is perhaps best reinforced by the barely snow-touched streets of Davos itself. Executives here told DealBook that they were frustrated with a lack of progress on issues like a global framework to tackle things like climate-risk disclosures.

Is Davos becoming more and more of a giant business conference despite its high-minded mission statement? This year, many of the world’s most influential heads of state aren’t here: The only Group of 7 leader present is Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany. The highest-ranking Biden administration official set to attend is Marty Walsh, the labor secretary, though lawmakers like Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are present.
But C.E.O.s are well-represented, including Amazon’s Andy Jassy, JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Pfizer’s Albert Bourla and countless others. Many aren’t participating in public panels, either; they’re holding private meetings with existing and prospective clients at hotels scattered across town. One C.E.O. said he was in back-to-back 30-minute meetings every day from 7:30 a.m. through 7 p.m., before heading to countless dinners.
Criticism of Davos is high this year. Bill Browder, the financier and anti-Putin activist, has drawn outsize attention after Semafor reported that the World Economic Forum had asked him to pay $250,000 to attend after charging him $70,000 in previous years. (He’s still attending private events to raise attention for his anti-Russian advocacy.)
Meanwhile, the comedian Russell Brand is seemingly devoting his talk show to criticizing the conference and how it’s tackling global problems. Greenpeace mocked Davos’s environmental aims by noting the enormous flock of private jets taken to the gathering. And the hedge fund mogul Dan Loeb, a onetime fixture of the Davos scene who stopped coming a few years ago, joked in a reply to Mr. Browder, “I remember when going to #Davos was prestigious and elite. I’m sure it’s still fun however.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Alibaba draws a meme stock activist. Ryan Cohen, whose investments in GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond helped stoke rallies in their shares, amassed a stake in the Chinese e-commerce group last year, The Wall Street Journal reports. Mr. Cohen has been pushing Alibaba for bigger stock buybacks; more broadly, he appears to be interested in investing in Chinese companies.
The E.U. reportedly plans to warn Microsoft about its Activision Blizzard deal. The European Commission will soon present the tech giant with its objections to the $69 billion takeover, according to Reuters. While it’s unclear whether the antitrust watchdog will move to block the transaction, this is the latest sign of the growing regulatory pushback for Microsoft.
China builds a lead in A.I. research. Chinese researchers in 2021 published roughly twice as many academic papers on the topic as their American counterparts did, and were also cited more frequently by other researchers, according to a study by Nikkei and the scientific publisher Elsevier. That underlines the growing tensions between the two countries over what they view as a vital technology.
Wyoming lawmakers propose a ban on electric cars. A group of state legislators are seeking to end sales of new electric vehicles there by 2035 in an effort to protect Wyoming’s oil and gas industries. The bill is the inverse of efforts by other states to eventually ban gas-powered cars, and comes as electric vehicle sales are becoming a bigger part of overall global car sales.

China’s double dose of bad news

The developments show that China, for decades the engine of global growth, is now entering a demographic crisis as some of the key drivers of its economy are under threat.

More people died in China last year than were born for the first time since Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward, an experiment that caused widespread famine and death, despite efforts to bolster the birthrate. Meanwhile, the country’s economy grew 3 percent last year — well short of Beijing’s 5.5 percent target — as lockdowns under a “zero Covid” policy hit manufacturing and consumer spending.
The end of “zero Covid” is stoking hopes for a global rebound. China’s economy performed better than analysts had expected in the fourth quarter — though many economists think official data was exaggerated — and is forecast to bounce back this year. Chinese consumers, free to travel again, are set to resume spending at home and abroad. As the world’s biggest consumer of commodities, China’s reopening will most likely bolster the businesses of metals and energy exporters. And as it is the world’s largest exporter of manufactured goods, global supply chain disruptions are expected to ease.
But bigger problems hang over any recovery. The declining population aggravates China’s long-term structural challenges, including the costs of managing an aging population while not producing enough new workers; Beijing’s growing scrutiny of private enterprise; a crisis in the property sector, a longtime pillar of growth; and rising pressure from the U.S. and the West on matters like semiconductors and A.I.

Is Beijing doing enough? Michael Pettis, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that Beijing faces unbalanced economic growth: Wealthier eastern provinces are thriving, but larger, more rural areas are being hit by economic decline and rising emigration. “For me the really big question marks concern the political implications of the ‘two’ diverging Chinas, and how Beijing decides to resolve them,” he tweeted.
Musk’s latest legal fight is set to begin
Elon Musk has his hands full these days, including with running Twitter after taking the company private last fall and with Tesla having to discount prices to fend off rivals. But starting today in a San Francisco federal courtroom, he will be occupied with something else: a trial over his 2018 plan to take Tesla private.
The legal battle, brought by disaffected Tesla shareholders, is the latest involving a tweet in which Mr. Musk said he was weighing a buyout of the company with “funding secured.” He ultimately didn’t go through with a deal, but that tweet led to a lengthy battle with the S.E.C. Now, if he loses, he could be forced to pony up billions of dollars in damages.
Mr. Musk has long argued that he did nothing wrong. The Tesla C.E.O. has consistently said he believed that he had the backing of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund when he posted his now-infamous tweet. (The fund’s chief told Mr. Musk that it hadn’t committed to such a deal, according to texts that emerged in court filings.) The S.E.C. and the litigious Tesla investors said that was a reckless and untrue tweet, something this trial’s judge has already said he agreed with in another case.
This trial revolves around the question of whether investors lost money trading Tesla shares as a result of statements by Mr. Musk that courts found false. Legal experts say that could be tricky. As of Friday’s close, Tesla shares are up more than sixfold since Mr. Musk’s August 2018 “funding secured” tweet, but it’s worth remembering that shortly after the post, Tesla shares whipsawed for several weeks, falling by more than 10 percent at one point.

Mr. Musk’s prospects of victory may have been undermined by Twitter. News reports describing his leadership of the social network as erratic — and the ill will that has stirred up among sectors of the public — have “saturated” the Bay Area, his lawyers argued in court. That made it hard to find an unbiased jury for the trial, they argued, though the presiding judge rejected their request to move proceedings to Texas.
Expect a cavalcade of prominent witnesses. Among those set to testify are Larry Ellison of Oracle, a former Tesla board member, and James Murdoch, a current one.

Ukrainian minister dies in a crash
Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Denys Monastyrsky, was one of at least 14 people who died yesterday in a helicopter crash. He is the highest-ranking Ukrainian official to die since Russia invaded last year. An investigation is underway, but there were no initial signs that the aircraft had been shot down.
The helicopter crash also damaged a kindergarten in a suburb of Kyiv. It happened at 8:20 a.m., a time when parents typically drop their children off at the school. There were conflicting death tolls, but officials said that a child had been killed.
Monastyrsky’s death deals a blow to a ministry that has played a critical role in the war effort: He oversaw police and emergency services and handled rescue efforts after missile strikes. His top deputy was also killed, as well as other pivotal figures in Ukraine’s wartime leadership.
Davos: In a video address to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, called for a moment of silence to remember the victims, then made a passionate speech.
“Tragedies are outpacing life. The tyranny is outpacing democracy,” Zelensky said. “The time the free world uses to think is used by the terrorist state to kill.”

China’s self-inflicted crisis
Economists are alarmed by China’s recent news that deaths outnumbered births last year for the first time in decades, a situation arriving sooner and more sharply than many experts had forecast.
China’s declining population threatens its position as the most populous country. Its shrinking work force could also hobble the global economy and erode its strength in coming decades. And the government’s efforts to reverse or slow the trend may be too little, and too late.
A shortage of factory employees in China — driven by a more educated workforce and a shrinking number of young people — could raise costs for consumers outside China, potentially exacerbating inflation in countries that rely heavily on imported Chinese products. The shrinking population could also mean a decline in spending by Chinese consumers, which could hurt global businesses that rely on China.
Within China, a plunging birthrate poses a major threat to its embattled real estate sector, which accounts for roughly a quarter of its economic output. And a shrinking work force may struggle to support China’s aging population. A 2019 report predicted that the country’s main pension fund, which many older Chinese residents rely on for income, would run out of money by 2035.

Self-inflicted crisis: China sped up its demographic struggles with its one-child policy, which was in effect from 1980 until 2016. Now, the government’s recent attempts to induce a baby boom have failed, as the high cost of housing and education deter potential parents.

A victory for Maria Ressa
In a rare legal win, Maria Ressa, the Philippine journalist and Nobel laureate, was acquitted of tax evasion yesterday.
Ressa is an outspoken critic of both Rodrigo Duterte, the former president, and current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Her uphill battle to keep publishing her news site, Rappler, has become emblematic of the Philippines’ declining press freedoms.
This recent case was the first high-profile test of whether her legal troubles would continue under Marcos; other cases are pending. The new president has benefited from online disinformation and tried to play down the brutality of his father’s dictatorship decades ago, but has declined to attack the country’s mainstream media, as Duterte did.

Singapore’s eats, in New York
A vivid bazaar of Singaporean dishes has opened in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, adapted from a grand concept by Anthony Bourdain. Urban Hawker, the food hall, puts cooks front and center: Most of the 17 vendors relocated from Asia to New York to work there.
One standout is Hainanese chicken rice, perhaps the country’s most recognized dish. Pete Wells, our New York restaurant critic, says it’s “fleshier, softer, more voluptuous than you’d think boiled poultry could be.” Other stalls prepare dishes that started out somewhere else but have adapted to or been adopted by Singaporeans, like biryanis and Malaysian coconut stew.
“You get an overview of Singaporean food unlike any you’ll find in a restaurant,” Pete writes, adding, “The stalls preserve and spotlight the separate origins of the dishes.”

2023-01-19,"Silicon Valley as we know it — with its radically transparent company cultures, empowered employees, flat hierarchies and rarefied perks like nap pods and free food — is quickly disappearing. And it’s unlikely to return.
For nearly two decades, tech companies heralded an approach that centered on making workers happy with benefits that were intended to seamlessly integrate work and life. They made well-being programs and unlimited vacation, initiatives that prioritized the whole person, standard employee benefits. This, along with high salaries and equity packages, was a way not just to win but also to dominate the war for talent. The rapid growth and success of Silicon Valley companies, driven in part by their unique people practices, reimagined workplace culture for a generation.
Times, as they say, are a-changin’. The industry is facing an uneven macroeconomic environment and a roiling stock market that is putting pressure on public tech companies and making for a less-than-ideal I.P.O. environment for private ones. Tech chief executives are now optimizing more for profitability than for growth at all costs, sometimes at the expense of long-held organizational beliefs.
The shift is most evident in the recent surge of tech layoffs. There has been lots of public discussion about the disruptive axing of half of Twitter’s 7,500 employees, a move conducted under its new owner, Elon Musk. Haphazard and rolling, the layoffs were painful to watch. The employees who remained have had to endure greater workloads on significantly smaller teams. But while outsiders may have viewed these layoffs as impulsive, they seemed to have primed the environment for other tech companies to follow. In 2022, the tech industry laid off over 150,000 people. In the first few weeks of 2023, Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts and Alphabet followed with 12,000.
According to multiple media outlets, Meta and Amazon use stack ranking for their employees, a controversial approach in evaluating talent. Popularized by G.E. in the 1980s (though the company later abandoned it), the process has managers rate their employees on a forced curve. Generally, only 20 percent are deemed top talent, and 10 to 15 percent must be designated as low performers. Although there are benefits, even in the best of times, the practice can create a competitive work environment that de-emphasizes employee improvement. With impending layoffs, people with the lowest ranking are typically the first to go.
The layoffs are part of a new age of bossism, the notion that management has given up too much control and must wrest it back from employees. After two decades of fighting for talent, chief executives are using this period to adjust for years of management indulgence that left them with a generation of entitled workers.

Reed Hastings will become executive chairman.
Credit...
Winnie Au for The New York Times
A streaming pioneer steps back
For 25 years, Reed Hastings was not only Netflix’s co-founder, but also its most visible cheerleader and advocate. Yesterday he announced that he would relinquish his co-C.E.O. title to a top deputy and become executive chairman.
The change comes as the streaming giant grapples with one of the most challenging moments in its history: Competitors are coming on strong, and Wall Street is keeping a close eye on its bottom line.
Mr. Hastings’s move had long been in the works. “Our board has been discussing succession planning for many years,” he wrote in a corporate blog post, comparing the move to the changing of the guard at other tech companies — think Jeff Bezos at Amazon last year, or Bill Gates at Microsoft — to give way to the next generation of leadership. (It’s hard not to compare the relative smoothness of this transition to, say, that of a key Netflix rival, Disney.)
Who’s stepping up? Picking up the co-C.E.O. role is Greg Peters, an architect of Netflix’s much-anticipated ad-supported subscription offering, who’ll share the title with the longtime Hastings lieutenant Ted Sarandos. (Setting tongues wagging in Hollywood was the additional news that Bela Bajaria, the company’s head of television who was recently profiled in The New Yorker, was promoted to chief content officer.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Does Mr. Hastings’s move signal anything about Netflix’s prospects? Over the past year, the company has sought to reassure investors about a number of issues, including:
Slowing subscriber growth, plus an actual drop in subscriber numbers last year, which drove a sharp slide in its stock.
Advances by rivals like Disney and Amazon, a tough thing to swallow for a company that regularly says its main competition includes sleep.
Its own multibillion-dollar debt-financed binging on content production, without a clear sense of the return on that investment.
Those challenges prompted Mr. Hastings, who said he had been largely delegating day-to-day management over the past two-and-a-half years, to become more hands-on again. (His reasserted presence was also seen as important as Netflix began taking steps it had long dismissed as unnecessary, like launching the cheaper, ad-supported service and cracking down on password sharing.) Recode’s Peter Kafka surmises that Mr. Hastings’s willingness to change roles might mean he believes Netflix has put the worst behind it. And investors sent shares higher in premarket trading.
Of course, it helped that Netflix had good financial news to report alongside its leadership transition, including better-than-expected subscriber and revenue growth. The question now is whether Netflix is truly in the clear, and whether Mr. Hastings will truly step back as Bezos has thus far — or find that he has to reassert himself again.

Google’s parent company will cut 12,000 jobs. Alphabet announced the layoffs, amounting to 6 percent of its work force, this morning. The move puts Alphabet alongside Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and other Silicon Valley titans in turning to job cuts to grapple with a slowdown in digital advertising and the economy more broadly.
The U.S. begins “extraordinary measures” to avert default. As the country hit the debt ceiling yesterday, the Treasury Department began moving money around to ensure the government can meet its financial obligations and avoid economic disruption or a default. Expect a long slog to end the standoff.
The crypto lender Genesis files for bankruptcy. The embattled company sought Chapter 11 after struggling in the wake of FTX’s collapse. It’s the latest blow to Genesis’s parent company, Digital Currency Group; another part of the crypto conglomerate, the industry publication CoinDesk, has hired Lazard to help it explore a sale.
A fat-fingered computer error is to blame for the F.A.A.’s computer outage.

What’s next in the E.S.G. wars?
We’ve seen governors and treasurers go out and seek to pull money out of certain pension funds because they claim that investment managers are using E.S.G. inappropriately. Well, one can foresee that beneficiaries — having seen the record of returns of the investment managers who are being penalized for using E.S.G. — could organize and tell those states to keep politics out of the investment world.
Can businesses push back?
The Kentucky Bankers Association recently sued the attorney general there to enjoin his investigation into financial institutions’ use of E.S.G. That is significant litigation, and I think that you’re gonna see more and more of this.
What else are you watching?
The area of covenants not to compete is very striking and important, and we saw the F.T.C. move into that arena pretty broadly. The noncompete historically has been used to really restrict and limit hourly wage workers just working to make ends meet. Once you start banning noncompetes all across the board, you’ve got to be really attentive as to what the impacts are and why companies devote time, energy and resources to recruiting and training and promoting people.
What big theme do you see emerging in 2023?
The whole idea of government increasingly playing a role in business and the politicization of how businesses choose to operate. I think you’re going to see a lot around that subject matter, namely about government intrusion into the workings of business.

Spot the “snow leopards”
What are the current trends that could change the future? Nassim Nicholas Taleb popularized the idea that the most consequential “black swan” events are often unpredictable. The Atlantic Council, a think tank, uses the term “snow leopards” to describe phenomena that could change the course of history, but that most of us may miss. DealBook got a first look at its list for this year.
A push to regulate algorithms is gathering pace. They influence what we see online, direct us on GPS and drive advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Governments are increasingly calling for stricter rules to rein in algorithms and make creators liable for any harm they cause, but expect Big Tech to push back.
Battery tech could democratize EV ownership. Electric vehicles could become cheaper and more efficient thanks to a shift in how battery tech is used. Structural batteries built into a car’s frame can reduce weight, improve its range and cut production costs.
Geoengineering may have unintended consequences. China and the United Arab Emirates are “seeding” clouds, and India and the U.S. are making advances in geoengineering, interventions in the environment to mitigate climate change. But the projects could also alter regional weather patterns, and there’s a danger that some countries may act unilaterally before the effects are well understood.
Pre-emptive corporate decoupling from China may accelerate. As tensions between the West and China escalate, wary corporations that fled Russia last year may shift away from China before they’re forced to do so. Notably, Apple is reportedly trying to shift some iPhone production to India, and Alphabet might move some Google Pixel phone manufacturing to Vietnam.
Two key U.S. allies could reconcile and shake up the Indo-Pacific. Japan and South Korea have been at loggerheads for years over grievances that date back to World War II. But there are signs that the neighbors — which each host tens of thousands of American troops — could overcome their differences, a move that would bolster the U.S.’s efforts to present a united front against a more assertive China, North Korea and Russia.
Platform workers are organizing worldwide. Non-contract workers who provide delivery, driving and other services through online platforms are fighting for better conditions and pay, with strikes and protests in Brazil, Britain and the Philippines an indication of a rising movement. Those efforts could lead to more government protections for many in the informal economy.

2023-01-21,"For a stretch of the pandemic, tech companies couldn’t hire fast enough. Talent wars broke out in Silicon Valley, with firms vying for software engineers, often lavishing extravagant perks on their new and would-be hires. As profits soared, executives acted as if the party would never end.
Now, it has — and workers are bearing the brunt of pullbacks. Nearly 200,000 tech employees have been laid off since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts in the sector. Four of the largest tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft — have announced a total of more than 50,000 job cuts in recent months.
But even after significant cuts, the largest tech companies are still behemoths. They grew enormously during the pandemic, adding tens of thousands of workers. The layoffs announced in recent weeks reverse a fraction of the hiring done in recent years.
In announcing the layoffs to employees, executives struck notably apologetic tones, expressing regrets about overzealous expansion and rapid hiring. The executives pointed to economic factors, made worse by inflation and rising interest rates. But they are also admitting that they over-hired, misreading the durability of the pandemic acceleration in the growth of online services.

2023-01-22,"Uncut diamonds usually are sold to dealers or jewelers who then incorporate them into the collections they sell to clients but Signum, a new company, intends to take a different approach: selling them directly to the public and introducing a digital companion as well.
The business was created in late 2021 by the owners of HB Antwerp, the diamond trading, cutting and polishing company that holds partial ownership of the 1,758-carat Sewelo, the second-largest diamond ever unearthed.
“We are aiming to create a new product and a new market,” Rafael Papismedov, co-founder and managing partner of Signum, said from his office in Antwerp, Belgium, the port city long considered the epicenter of the diamond trade.
The product is rough diamonds, each of 10 or more carats and priced at $500,000 or more, with cutting and polishing services included in the price. Also, HB Antwerp worked with Microsoft to develop its own blockchain-style ledger on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, so each gem is to be sold with a digital twin: a nonfungible token, or NFT, that would document its history and be proof of its authenticity. (Signum has been focused on the digital world from the start: Its debut in December 2021 was accompanied by the sale of 12 NFT diamond-themed artworks, which sold out.)

To start the physical side of the business, Mr. Papismedov said, 44 rough diamonds were selected for their beauty and rarity from among more than 4,000 stones over the past two years. In the next few months he intends to begin selling them to influential people — essentially trying to turn the brand and ambassador relationship upside down — and then expand sales to the public.
In recent years rough diamonds have been featured in some jewelry collections.
De Beers Jewellers has said its Talisman collection, introduced in 2005, pioneered the use of rough diamonds in jewelry — and, according to the house, Talisman continues to be one of its best-selling ranges. “There is something almost mystical about unpolished diamonds, nature’s purest works of art,” De Beers’s chief executive, Céline Assimon, wrote in an email.
Maison Mazerea, a jewelry brand introduced in July by Burgundy Diamond Mines of Perth, Australia, has offered polished and uncut diamonds in custom pieces. And the independent jeweler Melanie Georgacopoulos, who divides her time between London and Germany, wrote in an email that clients appreciated her 2020 collection featuring rough diamonds and natural pearls because “they do not scream money.”

Paul Zimnisky, an independent diamond analyst based in New York State, wrote in an email that Signum’s diamond pricing is in line, if on the high end, of current retail ranges, considering that the cost of a custom cut is included.

Does he believe such a business model can work? “This has always been an area that I have advocated for,” he wrote. “I think there is nothing more beautiful than a high-quality, good-color, octahedron-shaped rough diamond. It’s a true gem of nature. Diamond jewelry consumers, especially at the high end, are always looking for something special.”
Mr. Papismedov said integral parts of Signum’s business would be advising clients on alternate uses of rough diamonds, particularly in art, and highlighting the positive impact of diamond mining.
Critics say mining causes environmental damage and is linked to forced labor and other problems. But, Mr. Papismedov said, no one is telling the public “how some nations like Botswana and Canada are benefiting from mining, saving communities with jobs.”
He intends to have Signum participate in social programs promoting such efforts and will create what he called a cultural council of buyers so they can have a voice in the company’s choices of programs and donations.
Mr. Papismedov acknowledged that Signum’s offer was not for everyone. “Not only because we don’t have enough stones, and because of the very high pricing point,” he said. “But even if you do have the money, you still need the values and the commitment to become a Signum owner.”"

Another activist takes on Marc Benioff
Salesforce has been through a lot of turbulence lately, including a huge round of layoffs and a shake-up in its top ranks. Now it faces a big new threat in Elliott Management, the $55 billion hedge fund that has taken a significant stake in the company.
Elliott’s intervention will only add to the pressure on Salesforce’s co-founder and soon-to-be sole C.E.O., Marc Benioff, to bolster the software giant’s performance as it deals with an already challenging economic environment.
It isn’t clear what Elliott wants. The hedge fund, whose multibillion-dollar stake was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by DealBook, is known for shaking up huge companies, with demands that have included cost cuts, replacing executives and selling off businesses.
For now, Elliott is taking a cordial public approach. “We look forward to working constructively with Salesforce to realize the value befitting a company of its stature,” Jesse Cohn, managing partner at the hedge fund, said.
Salesforce is already battling another big activist: Starboard Value announced in October that it had built a stake and noted that the company has been underperforming its peers, but hasn’t publicly called for specific measures.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Benioff faces a number of challenges. Salesforce has seen its market value drop by roughly half since its peak in 2021, to $150 billion. It laid off 10 percent of its work force in the fall, after what Benioff said was excessive hiring in the tech market boom during the pandemic. Its co-C.E.O., Bret Taylor, is expected to step down this month, after what The Journal said was tension with Benioff. And Salesforce has been criticized for a multibillion-dollar acquisition spree that skeptics say hasn’t paid off.
That’s on top of a tough economic environment, which has driven companies to spend less on services like the software tools that Salesforce sells.
What’s next? Potential moves include more cost cuts — Salesforce still employs 71,000, more than it did before the pandemic — and a higher bar for doing takeovers. But Elliott hasn’t shied away from demanding a shake-up in executive ranks or selling off divisions, and its voice carries a lot of weight with other investors.
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Ken Griffin sets a record for hedge fund profits. His Citadel earned $16 billion last year, according to LCH Investments, beating the $15.6 billion that John Paulson collected in 2007 by betting against subprime mortgages in what was once called the “greatest trade ever.” But the picture was grimmer for hedge funds as a whole: The industry lost $208 billion last year.
The Biden administration dismisses a popular suggestion for ending the debt ceiling standoff. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the Fed is unlikely to accept a $1 trillion platinum coin that the U.S. would mint and then deposit at the central bank to provide funds to pay its debts, The Wall Street Journal reports. That removes the prospect of an easy solution for helping the country avoid a default later this year.
Brazil and Argentina begin talks on creating a common currency. The move by South America’s biggest economies could eventually grow to include other countries. It could eventually make the continent one of the world’s biggest currency blocs and reduce global reliance on the U.S. dollar.
Elizabeth Holmes may have tried to flee the U.S. In a court filing, prosecutors said the Theranos founder bought a one-way plane ticket to Mexico shortly after being convicted on fraud charges last January. She didn’t go on the trip, but they argue she has demonstrated a flight risk.

A new White House C.O.O.
With the departure of his chief of staff, Ron Klain, President Biden is losing his top lieutenant, and Corporate America is losing an ally. But they may find another in his replacement, Jeffrey Zients, who, as a former entrepreneur and management executive, has strong business credentials of his own. A drawback: He’s perceived to lack the political savvy of the highly influential Klain.

Mr. Zients won’t go it alone. As former coronavirus response coordinator, Mr. Zients oversaw a highly successful vaccination campaign despite no public health experience.
Still, the administration plans to spread out Mr. Klain’s responsibilities to several officials, including Anita Dunn, a senior Biden adviser and political and communications strategist whose former clients include AT&T, Lyft, Pfizer, Salesforce and Reddit; Steven Ricchetti, White House counselor and a former lobbyist, who like Mr. Klain is known to field calls from Wall Street; and Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, a deputy chief of staff and a co-founder of a consulting firm that advised Gates Ventures and other corporate clients.
Washington will be losing a communicator. Mr. Klain is reportedly always on and available to talk, whether with people on Wall Street; in the wee hours on the phone with the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer; or over a glass of wine on the houseboat of Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia.
Mr. Klain has deep connections throughout Washington: He previously served as chief of staff for Vice President Al Gore; worked as a lobbyist at the law firm O’Melveny & Myers, for clients like Cigna, Fannie Mae, Time Warner and US Airways; and worked at Revolution LLC, a tech investment firm started by Steve Case, the billionaire co-founder of AOL
Mr. Klain has been one of Biden’s primary negotiators. He has been a reliable interlocutor in fraught times, said Chris Lehane of the crypto investment firm Haun Ventures, who worked for Mr. Klain when he was chief of staff to Gore. “One of the things on the business side people always worry about, or think about, is, ‘Who is in the room that matters when big things are going down?’”
With Mr. Klain, Corporate America knew that someone very high up “would ask the right questions and consider all the issues,” Mr. Lehane told DealBook, likening the role of chief of staff to that of “C.O.O. of the federal government.” (Republicans called Klain “Prime Minister Klain.”)

Crypto’s spreading collapse
Traditional financial institutions are cooling on crypto. Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, said yesterday that one of its partners, Signature Bank, was reducing its exposure to digital assets and would only handle dollar transactions for customers of the company worth more than $100,000.

Regulators have warned banks about “safety and soundness.” The Fed, the F.D.I.C. and Office of the Comptroller of Currency issued a joint statement this month outlining the risks for institutions handling crypto. These included fraud, potential runs on assets and contagion.
The industry’s big players are deeply entwined. The crypto lender Genesis, which says its collapse was set off by the fall of FTX, will have its first bankruptcy hearing today. Genesis froze hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets in November that it lent out via a yield product on the crypto exchange Gemini, leaving the latter’s customers in the lurch and the two companies facing charges of offering a nonregistered security by the S.E.C. But even as Genesis was struggling, former executives named in the filing were trying to woo investors to a new crypto hedge fund.
Lawyers may be the only winners in crypto right now. After objections from senators, creditor representatives and the founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, a Delaware bankruptcy court on Friday ruled that the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell could continue to work on the case. Bankman-Fried has accused the firm of conflicts of interest based on previous work it had done for his companies.

Investors see big returns in pro tennis
The stunners at the Australian Open keep coming, with No. 1 seed Iga Swiatek going down to defeat on Monday. The drama is growing off the court, too. A coterie of billionaires, deep-pocketed companies and star players are engaged in a high-stakes battle to remake the tennis business, report The Times Mathew Futterman and DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch.
ADVERTISEMENT

Professional tennis has roughly one billion fans worldwide, and estimated annual revenues of $2.5 billion — a fraction of the N.F.L.’s $18 billion juggernaut business. Tennis players receive a much smaller percentage of the pot, and, critics say, poor management, excess bureaucracy and matches that go long into the night are capping the sport’s potential.
The private equity firm CVC Capital Partners believes the game is ripe for disruption. In seeking to buy a 20 percent stake in the Women’s Tennis Association, the firm wants to increase prize money for players and ensure it’s more equitably distributed between men and women. CVC also wants to gain a foothold with the Association of Tennis Professionals, the men’s tennis league, possibly opening up a path to investment there as well.
“This is definitely the time to go long on tennis, 100 percent,” the billionaire investor Bill Ackman told The Times. Mr. Ackman is funding a fledgling players’ organization led by the Serbian star Novak Djokovic. That group is searching for ways to grow the sport’s financial pie and the size of the players’ slice. One idea they’re mulling: a player-run fifth Grand Slam tournament.
The week ahead
A parade of tech earnings and economic data releases will give investors plenty to ponder. Major markets in China will be closed this week for the Lunar New Year festivities. Here’s what’s happening:
Tomorrow: The U.S., Britain and eurozone countries will publish January Purchasing Managers’ Index data, a reliable corporate indicator of economic sentiment. Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson and 3M report earnings. (And nominations for the Academy Awards will be announced.)

Taylor Swift will be much discussed at today’s Senate hearing.

Caitlin Ochs/Reuters
Ticketmaster in the hot seat
Two months after Ticketmaster canceled sales for Taylor Swift’s upcoming Eras tour, a top executive from its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, will appear at the Senate on Tuesday to defend the company. (Ms. Swift herself is not scheduled to show up.)
Expect lawmakers to pepper Live Nation’s president and C.F.O., Joe Berchtold, with questions about whether its grip on ticket sales for the concert and events industry — it controls about 70 percent, by some critics’ reckoning — is too tight.
“However you look at it, that’s a monopoly,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, told Rolling Stone. Critics have accused Live Nation of using its market dominance to charge high fees and of threatening to ice out venues from Live Nation events if they don’t use Ticketmaster. (The Times reported in November that the Justice Department was looking into the company.)
Taking on Ticketmaster is a bipartisan affair: Standing beside Ms. Klobuchar in announcing a hearing on concert ticketing last fall was Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. “It strikes me as being kind of problematic that they’re the only game in town,” Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, told The New Republic.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Ticketmaster is no stranger to criticism over its dominance. In 2019, Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, urged the Justice Department to investigate the “broken” ticket industry.
Artists have long complained about Ticketmaster’s role. The band Lawrence, whose co-founder, Clyde Lawrence, wrote a Times Opinion essay on the topic last year, included the line “Live Nation is a monopoly” in its 2021 song “False Alarms.” Perhaps most famously, Pearl Jam filed an antitrust complaint against Ticketmaster in 1994 — 16 years before it merged with Live Nation — kicking off a federal investigation that ultimately fizzled.
Live Nation strongly denies breaking antitrust law. After the Swift fiasco, it attributed Ticketmaster’s dominance to “the large gap that exists between the quality of the Ticketmaster system and the next best primary ticketing system.” It also argues that Ticketmaster is far from having a monopoly in the secondary market. (Jack Groetzinger, the C.E.O. of SeatGeek, is scheduled to testify on Tuesday as well.)
Still, according to written testimony released ahead of Tuesday’s hearing, Mr. Berchtold of Live Nation will say that “there are several things we could have done better.” He will also seek to blame scalpers’ bots swarming Ticketmaster’s site for ultimately denying fans the ability to buy tickets for the Swift tour, and he has a letter from the country star Garth Brooks calling on Congress to make scalping illegal.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Sam Bankman-Fried gave $400 million to an obscure crypto trading firm. Federal prosecutors are investigating whether the investment in Modulo Capital was made with funds belonging to customers of FTX, Bankman-Fried’s bankrupt crypto exchange, The Times reports. Raising concerns: Mr. Bankman-Fried’s close personal ties to Modulo, and its founder’s business partner. Neither of the Modulo founders have been accused of wrongdoing; through an attorney, they declined to comment.
The Justice Department will reportedly sue Google over its digital ad dominance. Prosecutors may file a lawsuit as soon as this week, according to Bloomberg. It would be the department’s second antitrust suit against Google in recent years, and part of a broader crackdown on tech giants.
Another activist investor reportedly emerges at Salesforce. Jeff Ubben of Inclusive Capital has taken a stake in the business software giant and spoken with its co-founder, Marc Benioff, according to CNBC. That would make the third activist to invest in Salesforce, after Starboard Value and Elliott Management.
Elon Musk says he could have secured funding to take Tesla private. At a trial over his 2018 effort to buy the carmaker, Mr. Musk said that his “funding secured” tweet referred not only to his belief that Saudi Arabia would help finance the deal, but also to his stake in SpaceX, which he could theoretically have borrowed against. Under questioning, he acknowledged he hadn’t mentioned the SpaceX stake in a 2021 deposition.
A former senior F.B.I. official is charged with helping a Russian oligarch. Prosecutors accused Charles McGonigal, who oversaw some of the agency’s most sensitive counterintelligence operations, of taking money from Oleg Deripaska in exchange for helping to get him off the U.S. sanctions list. It’s a rare accusation against a senior F.B.I. official.

Microsoft’s A.I. bet may be more bad news for Salesforce
Microsoft’s decision to invest another $10 billion in the company behind ChatGPT could add to the troubles at Salesforce, which is already dealing with activist investors, a leadership shake-up and laying off thousands of workers. Microsoft plans to integrate ChatGPT technology across products like email, slide shows and spreadsheets.
But DealBook has learned that Microsoft expects this technology to improve its software that manages a company’s interactions with customers — Salesforce’s main business.
ADVERTISEMENT

Microsoft is doubling down on customer relations software. Last year, Microsoft launched an app called Viva Sales that automates some customer relationship management, or C.R.M., functions across its products, including Teams and Outlook. The app can, for example, automatically write a meeting summary, which it then uses to track progress on goals discussed.
Behind the Journalism

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
ChatGPT boosts this sector’s revenue potential for Microsoft. The product “will only get better with GPT,” Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, said, adding that the technology could also help curate content ideas or automate repetitive tasks like email.
The Guggenheim Partners analyst John DiFucci estimates that C.R.M. could eventually be a $7 billion opportunity for Microsoft, up from the roughly $3 billion it brings in today. “I always wondered why Microsoft wasn’t a more major player — especially given that they have Outlook, which is sort of a C.R.M. system,” he said.

But Salesforce has a strong incumbent position. The company has been experimenting with its own artificial intelligence; its C.E.O., Marc Benioff, is a declared fan of ChatGPT. And for companies that use Salesforce, the costs of switching providers are high. Still, Microsoft is a formidable competitor and its products are already ubiquitous in corporations.
The addition of A.I. to that arsenal could make its products “more intelligent than what Salesforce has today,” according to Sid Nag, an analyst at Gartner. “And Salesforce has to tell the world how they will respond to that.”
Scenes from Alphabet’s layoff-focused all-hands
After Google’s parent, Alphabet, announced the biggest round of job cuts in its history, senior executives of the tech giant spoke before restive employees to explain why the company had laid off 12,000 of their colleagues so abruptly — and why those who remain shouldn’t lose heart.
Highlights from Monday’s town hall meeting, according to news reports:
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It was impossible to give managers more warning about the cuts, Alphabet’s chief people officer, Fiona Cicconi, said: “In an ideal world, we would have given managers a heads-up, but we have over 30,000 managers at Google.”
Top executives will have their bonuses cut by an unspecified amount.
Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s C.F.O., denied that investors — including the activist shareholder TCI, which disclosed a stake in the company and demanded cost cuts — had driven the layoff decisions.
Laid-off workers saw their access to internal systems cut immediately out of an abundance of caution, according to Royal Hansen, Google’s vice president of security. The move irked some employees.
Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s C.E.O., reminded employees that 2023 would be pivotal as the company confronts a host of business challenges. “It will be an important year given the rapid advancements in A.I.,” he said, echoing the company’s “code-red” warnings about threats like ChatGPT.
“Redditors, thank you so much for helping create the best pipeline we’ve ever had.”

The tech stock rally faces a dose of reality
Sweeping layoffs, looming regulatory trouble, the prospect of upstarts like ChatGPT causing a “code red” disruption at tech giants — none of these challenges appear to bother investors.
The Nasdaq Composite has gained 8.6 percent so far this year. Investors have been buying tech stocks in the belief that inflation is easing enough for the Fed to begin slowing the pace of its interest rate increases.
Tech titans are among the best-performing stocks in 2023, with the FANG+ Index — which includes such tech giants as Amazon, Apple, Meta and Netflix — up 14.8 percent in 2023, on pace for its best month since August 2020.
Image
But the rally could hit trouble as soon as Tuesday. Microsoft will report earnings after markets close, the first of the big tech companies to do so. Investors will be paying close attention to its full-year outlook for any signs of a pickup in customers’ I.T. spending. Before the recent rally, analysts had been cutting their earnings forecasts for tech companies, speculating that a slowing economy would crimp revenues and profits.
Some warn that the January rebound could fade — and fast. “Investors should not assume that the easy times in the market are coming back,” David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, a wealth management firm, wrote in an investor note on Monday. “We expect enhanced volatility” as the prospect of a recession still looms.

Microsoft announced its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday, reporting its slowest growth in six years, with profit falling 12 percent and revenue rising 2 percent from a year earlier; both figures fell below Wall Street expectations. The earnings report came after the tech giant said it was making a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar” investment in OpenAI, the start-up that designed the chatbot ChatGPT, as Microsoft seeks to push artificial intelligence technology further and compete with rivals like Amazon, Apple and Google.

The company announced last week that it would lay off 10,000 employees, less than five percent of its payroll."
2023-01-26,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, the fast-casual food chain, said on Thursday that it planned to hire 15,000 workers ahead of its busiest time of year, a sharp contrast to the other large companies that are laying off employees because of pandemic overexpansion and worries about the economy.
The company said in a statement that it was preparing for what it described as “burrito season,” from March to May, when it typically has most of its business.
“We will continue bringing in new crew to support Chipotle’s aggressive growth plans,” Scott Boatwright, Chipotle’s chief restaurant officer, said in a statement. The company employs more than 100,000 people at more than 3,000 restaurants across North America. Its long-term plan calls for eventually running 7,000 outlets.
Unlike Chipotle, many companies are shedding staff and cutting costs. Tech companies in particular have recently announced layoffs, with tens of thousands of job cuts at Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and others. Industrial firms like Dow, banks like Goldman Sachs and media companies like The Washington Post have also recently laid off employees.
The Federal Reserve has been paying close attention to the labor market as it raises interest rates to bring inflation under control by slowing the economy. The most recent data showed that U.S. employers added fewer jobs in December than in earlier months, but the pace of hiring remained solid.
A spokeswoman for Chipotle said in an email that the company frequently had the most sales in the spring because of “weather and daylight.” She added that restaurants in college areas did well when school was in session. The company opened more than 200 restaurants last year and plans to open up to 285 this year, the spokeswoman said, and it anticipates it will need to recruit more workers.
Wells Fargo analysts expressed doubt about Chipotle’s ability to hire, given “pockets of wage pressure,” they wrote in a report. The company has so far been able to offset higher pay and recruiting costs by raising menu prices, but signs of slower sales late last year suggest that may not last.
In its latest earnings report, for the third quarter of 2022, Chipotle recorded a profit of nearly $260 million, up more than 20 percent from a year earlier. In October, the company said its prices were on track to rise by nearly 15 percent in 2022 as it, like many consumer-facing companies, passed on higher costs to consumers."

D.C. diplomacy, Musk style
Elon Musk showed up in Washington yesterday to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, setting off speculation about what the billionaire C.E.O. of Twitter, Tesla and SpaceX was up to.
Happy birthday, Mr. Speaker. Mr. McCarthy, a California Republican, was tight-lipped when he spoke to reporters after their conversation, saying only that they were old friends and that Mr. Musk had come to offer his best wishes on Mr. McCarthy’s 58th birthday.
But Mr. Musk indicated that the visit was all about business, and that it included a chat with the top House Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries of New York. “Just met with @SpeakerMcCarthy & @RepJeffries to discuss ensuring that this platform is fair to both parties,” Mr. Musk tweeted (though he reportedly didn’t have a scheduled meeting with the Democrat and met him in passing in Mr. McCarthy’s office).
Mr. Musk and Mr. McCarthy go way back. The Twitter boss supported the Republican in his drawn-out bid to become speaker this month and spoke at a G.O.P. retreat that Mr. McCarthy hosted in Wyoming last summer. Mr. McCarthy has stood up for Mr. Musk, too, telling the Biden administration to stop picking on him after he bought Twitter.
One of Mr. McCarthy’s first moves as speaker was to form a new panel on the supposed “weaponization” of the government to investigate President Biden’s efforts to pressure social media platforms. The decision was partly inspired by the so-called Twitter Files, internal documents Mr. Musk released to a few independent journalists, including some about the company’s handling of reporting on Hunter Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election, when Jack Dorsey was running the company.

The House is investigating Twitter. The Oversight Committee is planning a hearing on the Hunter Biden issue. Conservatives contend that the Twitter Files are an example of a wider campaign by the left to suppress unfavorable information on social media and smother voices on the right. Mr. Musk, a self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist, has vowed to rectify this now that he owns the company.
Mr. Musk isn’t the only ally the speaker has spoken up for. Mr. McCarthy tried to use his position to push the company to reinstate the personal account of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia after she was kicked off the platform last year for violating its coronavirus misinformation policy. The revelation prompted the blog Techdirt to ask: Where are the Twitter Files for Mr. McCarthy?
Mr. Musk’s mission to build out a fair platform comes as the company is still facing blowback from his leadership. More than 500 advertisers have reportedly paused spending since he took over, with ad revenue down about 40 percent on concerns about content moderation.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Elliott reportedly prepares for a board fight at Salesforce. The hedge fund is interviewing candidates to nominate as directors for the business software giant, according to The Wall Street Journal. Salesforce is said to be weighing its own board shake-up — including the potential addition of Mason Morfit, the C.E.O. of the activist fund ValueAct, Bloomberg reports.
Bed Bath & Beyond says it’s in default. The troubled home goods retailer said it had defaulted on some debt payments, and warned it did “not have sufficient resources” to pay its obligations. The Times reports that the company may file for bankruptcy within weeks.
The Adani Group continues to buckle after a short seller takes aim. Shares in companies controlled by the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani have fallen as much as 20 percent since Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of fraud. The veteran short seller Bill Ackman tweeted that he found Hindenburg’s report “highly credible.”
Intel shares drop after a disappointing quarter. The chip giant’s stock is down 8 percent in premarket trading after it reported falling sales and a bigger-than-expected loss. Don’t expect good news anytime soon: Intel predicted another loss in the current quarter and declined to provide a full-year forecast.
Stripe hires banks to help it weigh going public. The payment processing company tapped Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to consider options for a public offering over the next 12 months. It’s a tall ask with the I.P.O. market in the doldrums; bankers tell DealBook they don’t expect it to recover any time soon.

Why markets will zero in on today’s inflation data
Investors have been in a buying mood so far, pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to a new high for 2023 yesterday. A big test of that conviction will come today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern when the Commerce Department releases new data on the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge.
ADVERTISEMENT

Economists expect more good news. They are forecasting that the P.C.E. rose 4.4 percent on an annual basis last month, which is still too high for the Fed’s liking, but down sharply from the 6.3 percent reading in August.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
If so, that would add more fuel to investor speculation that the Fed will begin to ease up on, or even end, its policy of interest rate increases by midyear. Markets rose after yesterday’s gross domestic product data showed that the U.S. economy grew more than expected in the fourth quarter.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq has now gained 10.8 percent this year. Tech stocks (and, particularly, high-growth ones) have historically performed better when inflation moderates and bond yields fall. On cue, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes has fallen by 31 basis points this year as investors pour money into long-dated sovereign bonds.
Image
Even still, recession fears persist. Market watchers are closely tracking bond yields for signs of an inverted yield curve — this time, involving interest rates on 10-year bonds falling below 2-year notes.
“An inverted yield curve means the government can borrow for 10 years at a cheaper interest rate than it can for two years or even three months, which typically only happens ahead of or during a recession,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, warned in a note to clients yesterday.

Blackstone’s up-and-down quarter
Blackstone’s fourth-quarter earnings report yesterday presented a mixed picture of the investment giant’s performance — including more news about investment funds that have been in Wall Street’s focus for weeks.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Investors still want to pull money from Blackstone’s real estate funds. Executives said they’re working through a backlog of requests to withdraw money from the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, or Breit, a huge nontraded fund meant for wealthy individuals, after an increase in such requests last year. But the firm also disclosed that it faces over $5 billion in requests to withdraw money from BPP, a fund aimed at institutional investors.
Blackstone is still limiting redemption requests, though the firm pointed to a $4 billion investment in Breit by the investment manager for the University of California — and an additional $500 million the system pledged on Wednesday. It also reported that Breit had posted an 8.4 percent return for 2022. (Jon Gray, Blackstone’s president, added that concern about redemptions had been overblown: “The media has created a different narrative, but the customers are fundamentally happy,” he told analysts.)
The firm also fell short of an ambitious fund-raising goal. Assets under management rose to $974.7 billion last year, up 11 percent year-on-year. But that’s still shy of the $1 trillion that Blackstone had expected to reach in 2022.
Still, investors appeared undeterred: Blackstone’s shares rose more than 5 percent yesterday.

The McDonald’s ruling everyone is talking about
A landmark Delaware chancery court ruling this week could put a whole new rank of company officials in the legal firing line for breaches of fiduciary duties — not just the board.
“Duty of oversight” extends beyond directors. Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster ruled that David Fairhurst, former global chief people officer at McDonald’s, could be sued by shareholders who accused him of allowing a “culture of sexual misconduct and harassment to develop” at the company. (Mr. Fairhurst took on the role shortly after Steve Easterbrook became C.E.O., and both men were fired following allegations of inappropriate behavior.) When it comes to breaches of fiduciary duties — like so-called “duty of oversight” — Delaware courts have typically ruled that the buck stops with the board. Fairhurst had sought that very legal protection, but Mr. Laster, in a first-of-its-kind ruling for the court, rejected the argument.
This has huge implications for officer liability. Giving company executives the “duty of oversight,” given that they manage much of a company’s daily operations, means they can be sued for big money — millions, or even billions. (Many of these lawsuits would be covered by directors and insurance liability, said Kevin LaCroix, a lawyer who specializes in such matters.)
Several lawyers told DealBook that, in this case, the level of oversight responsibility is defined so broadly that it opens the floodgates to lawsuits. What happens, for example, to the chief information security officer whose company is hacked? Expect a rash of reports from corporate law firms criticizing the decision.
Others argued that perhaps courts have for too long given executives the benefit of the doubt, and that the threat of eye-popping shareholder lawsuits is far more powerful in ensuring rightful duty than, say, the possibility of a $10,000 settlement in an employment lawsuit (a more typical remedy for something like allowing a corrosive culture).

What’s Up? (Jan. 22-28)
Job Cuts, and Not Just in Tech
What began as a wave of ominous job cuts by technology companies is rippling through other industries, most recently media and retail. In the last week alone, layoffs, or reports of coming layoffs, have swept The Washington Post, Vox and Saks.com. Adding to the tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers, Spotify said on Monday that it was cutting 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, and IBM announced on Wednesday that it would shed 3,900. Tech’s challenges may be somewhat particular to the sector — employers have largely pointed to overhiring during the pandemic as a reason for the recent cuts — but its upheaval can be an indicator of where the economy is heading. Yet even as layoffs appear to creep across the job market, unemployment claims overall remain low, and millions of jobs are open across the country.
A Growing Economy
Despite what might seem to be obvious harbingers of an economic downturn — mass layoffs, for example — there are other signs of relative health. Take gross domestic product, an indicator that was not as reliable at the beginning of the pandemic but has since normalized. The latest report on G.D.P., when adjusted for inflation, shows the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, suggesting that it has been largely resilient in the face of inflation, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Though just a few months ago, G.D.P. numbers met one commonplace standard for determining a recession, the most recent data would seem to assuage fears. But only to a certain extent —  many economists still expect a recession to begin later this year.
Elon Musk Takes the Stand
More than four years after he posted a tweet telling his followers that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private, Elon Musk, now the chief executive of both Tesla and Twitter, appeared in court to defend that statement against a lawsuit. He provided seven hours of testimony over three days, arguing that funding for a deal with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund was plentiful but dodging a question about whether a specific dollar amount had been discussed. In the 2018 tweet, Mr. Musk suggested that he had secured $420 a share (a favorite number of the billionaire’s). Lawyers for the plaintiffs, a group of Tesla investors, are trying to build a case to prove that Mr. Musk’s actions led to the wild swings in Tesla’s stock, causing them to lose money. Some experts believe they are likely to succeed: Last year, the senior U.S. District Court judge hearing the case ruled that he agreed with the plaintiffs that Mr. Musk was “deliberately reckless” — investors’ words — when he posted the tweet.

What’s Next? (Jan. 29-Feb. 4)
A Smaller Rate Increase?
The Federal Reserve took its first step toward slowing its interest rate increases last month, when it broke a streak of aggressive three-quarter-point increases with a half-point one. At its meeting on Tuesday, the central bank may opt to slow its pace further. In recent weeks, Fed officials including Susan M. Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, have discussed the possibility of a quarter-point move. “There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase,” Mr. Waller said. But he echoed his colleagues in emphasizing that their campaign to fight inflation was not over yet, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has made clear officials’ intention to raise the policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of the year.

Labor Market Resilience
The jobs report on Friday will provide the first glimpse at the strength of the labor market in 2023 — though it is expected to look a lot like the end of 2022. That is to say, like recent months of jobs reports, this one is expected to show another month of solid but slowing growth. The question is, how long can these conditions last? While the labor market has long been buoyant in defiance of the Fed’s attempts to cool the economy, the higher interest rates are still slowly permeating through the economy.
Slower Growth for Tech Companies
After a stretch of bad news for the country’s largest tech companies, this week’s quarterly earnings reports are poised to deliver … more bad news. Microsoft helped kicked off the tech-sector portion of earnings season last week by reporting its slowest growth in six years. Amazon, which will release its quarterly results on Thursday, the same day as Alphabet and Apple, is expected to report exceptionally slow growth — the slowest in two decades, analysts predict. While Amazon and its peers may be hurting, these companies continue to bring in billions in profit, and some are making big investments even as they say their aim with layoffs is to trim costs. Days after announcing plans to cut 10,000 jobs, Microsoft, for example, said it planned to invest $10 billion in the artificial intelligence lab behind the chatbot ChatGPT.
What Else?
Live Nation Entertainment, the parent of Ticketmaster, which canceled its plans to sell tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming tour, was cast as a monopoly by top Democrats during a Senate hearing (some used Ms. Swift’s lyrics to make their point). A glitch on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday led to wild price swings for major stocks, adding or wiping out billions in market value. Meta said it would reinstate former President Donald J. Trump’s Instagram and Facebook accounts “in the coming weeks.”"

2023-02-01,"Plagiarizing essays. Cheating on tests. Spreading misinformation. The advent of new, powerful artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has sparked concerns about the unintended consequences of the technology and debate over the ethical implications of its use.
Despite concerns, A.I. assistants seem here to stay. After ChatGPT’s splashy debut late last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI, the lab behind the chatbot. The threat from a rival forced Google to regroup. And the media site BuzzFeed recently announced that it would use A.I. to write online quizzes and other content.
Given the growing influence of this technology, it’s time to focus on how we can start reaping the benefits in a responsible way. Many A.I. experts and computer scientists agree that these tools can provide a major perk that does no harm: editing our writing.
In this context, we would still be using our skills and brainpower to do the hard work of making sense of information and coming up with new ideas, while turning to A.I. for some light assistance, such as making a sentence sound more conversational, sprinkling in some historical context or even adding a joke.

For several days, I tested Wordtune Spices and Rytr, two A.I. writing assistants released by start-ups in the last two years, and compared them with ChatGPT. I’ll go over some examples that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each of these three tools.
Test 1: Rewriting a Sentence
To use Wordtune Spices, which the Israeli start-up AI21 Labs released last month, you insert text into a box, highlight the sentences you want edited and then click on options to make improvements. Among its best uses during my recent test were quick rewrites of sentences.
For example, I took this sentence from my column last week about email addresses and privacy:
When you browse the web, an increasing number of sites and apps are asking for a piece of basic information that you probably hand over without hesitation: your email address.
Then I clicked the “Rewrite” button. Wordtune Spices shot back a list of options for revisions of the sentence. I liked this one best:
Your email address is one of the most basic pieces of info that is being requested by more and more websites and apps.
My original sentence included a significant detail to me — that we hand over our email addresses without hesitation — but the tool trimmed a few words to cut to the chase and summarize the heart of the problem. Not bad.
Test 2: Catching Grammatical Errors
Rytr, an A.I. writing assistant released in 2021 by a company of the same name, was designed to streamline the creation of blog posts and marketing copy. It was proficient at catching grammatical errors (as, similarly, word-processing tools like Microsoft Word have been doing for decades).
In my test, I took this paragraph, which has intentional errors, from an educational website that provides editing exercises:
Facebook, with more then 1 Billion users Is celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launching by Mark Zuckerberg at 4th February 2004. The site was Conceived in a Harvard dorm in a way To connect student and let them build an Identity for himself online.
Then in Rytr, I highlighted the paragraph and clicked “Improve.” It gave me this:
Facebook, with more than 1 billion users, celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launched by Mark Zuckerberg on February 4th, 2004. The site was conceived in a Harvard dorm as a way to connect students and let them build an identity for themselves online.
The tool automatically rewrote an error-free version of the paragraph. This could be extremely handy as a study tool or for non-native English speakers.

Test 3: Adding Context
Wordtune Spices also excelled at fleshing out paragraphs with additional context. By pressing the + button, you can add color and background information to a piece of text by inserting historical data, a joke and an example to prove your point.
For example, I took this paragraph from my column last week:
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. It acts as a digital bread crumb for companies to link your activity across sites and apps to serve you relevant ads.
In Wordtune Spices, I clicked the + button to add an example, a historical fact and a joke. (Changes in bold.)
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. For example, by tracking your purchases, companies can recommend products or services that are relevant to you. The first email marketing blast was sent in 1978 by a man named Gary Thuerk who worked for Digital Equipment Corp. And with that, Gary Thuerk was sent down in history as the world’s first ‘Spam’ Lord!
After doing some research, I was impressed to learn that 1978 was indeed when email was first used for marketing. The example of using email receipts to serve targeted ads was also accurate. The joke wasn’t very funny, but it lightened things up.
Test 4: Ending This Column
Last, I pasted this entire column into each writing assistant to see if it could come up with a kicker, or a clever conclusion to wrap this all up.
ChatGPT was the only one of the three that was able to read the entire text to generate a plausible conclusion:
With A.I. writing assistants like ChatGPT, Wordtune Spices, and Rytr, we have a powerful tool to enhance our writing - but only if we use it responsibly.
Wordtune Spices produced an unusable takeaway:
With the help of writing assistants, I was able to finish this column with a well-crafted conclusion that ties together all the points I have discussed.
Rytr did, um, something:
Coaches in the National Football League earn an average of $2,000,000 annually.
AI21 Labs, the Israeli start-up that developed Wordtune Spices, said current A.I. writing technology required more guidance from the user than the prompt I had given the tools. Rytr said its users could use a feedback tool to train its A.I. in the event that something went wrong. OpenAI declined to comment.
All this shows that artificial intelligence can be an effective tool for improving our work. I was surprised by some of the results — in particular, that Wordtune Spices could add accurate and relevant background information. I may occasionally use the tool for suggestions on fleshing out paragraphs with some historical data, though I will then check the facts before publishing them.

And in general, the A.I. bots were useful for sharpening prose and cleaning up clunky, ungrammatical sentences.
What the bots couldn’t do, however, was the research or reporting to show their strengths and weaknesses. That requires thought."
2023-02-02,"When a Covid-19 outbreak in China forced a lockdown of Apple’s largest iPhone factory in November, the world’s most valuable company warned investors that it would lose sales. The question was: How much?
On Thursday, Apple reported that revenue fell 5 percent to $117.15 billion during the three months that ended in December, the company’s first quarterly sales decline since before the pandemic. Profits decreased 13 percent to $30 billion.
Apple’s results are the latest evidence of the challenges buffeting the tech industry. After recording double-digit sales gains during the early pandemic, companies have recently shifted to cost cutting and mass layoffs, with Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet — Google’s parent company — each eliminating at least 10,000 jobs.
A less severe whiplash has hit Apple. From 2020 to 2022, the company increased its annual revenue by nearly $125 billion. But demand for iPhones, iPads and Macs has slowed, causing investors to sour on the company. Over the course of a year, Apple lost $1 trillion in market value, a stunning reversal for the only U.S. company to ever reach a valuation of $3 trillion.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The company’s shares declined about 4 percent in after-hours trading, reversing most of the gains from earlier in the day when tech shares rallied following Meta’s earnings report on Wednesday. Wall Street had expected $122 billion in sales and $31 billion in profit.
Though its business has slowed, Apple hasn’t moved to cut jobs. Unlike some of its peers, such as Google and Meta, which aggressively hired during the first years of the pandemic to keep up with demand, Apple remained disciplined, adding 24,000 new workers, just 3,000 more than it added in the three years before 2020.
Still, many investors have reduced their stakes in Apple out of concern its business will be hit by the slowing economy. Consumer spending in the United States, Apple’s largest market, has declined, posing a potential challenge to sales of pricey iPhones.
“It’s impacting the higher end consumer’s willingness to spend and that’s going to impact the most valuable company in the world,” said Dave Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which has about $5 billion under management and an investment in Apple.
Apple recorded $65.78 billion in iPhone sales, an 8 percent decline from the previous year. The modest decline testified to the company’s supply chain acumen. After the company shut down its biggest iPhone factory in November, it shifted some production to other factories, according to Counterpoint, a market research firm.

On the sales front, Apple benefited as more iPhone buyers chose its more expensive Pro models, lifting the average selling price 9 percent to $936, according to Counterpoint.
Apple offset its iPhone struggles with increased sales of its iPads and services. The company said its iPad business recorded $9.4 billion in sales, a 30 percent increase. It increased sales of apps and subscription services such as Apple Music to $20.77 billion, about 6 percent from the previous year.
The company’s biggest challenge remains its concentrated supply chain in China. The faltering of U.S.-China relations has accelerated, with Congress creating a special committee this year to evaluate competition with Beijing. Concerns are also mounting in Washington that China could soon take military action against Taiwan.
Amid the rising tensions, Apple has shifted production from China to Vietnam and India. But a vast majority of its revenue continues to come from products made in China. And Chinese consumers count for about a fifth of total sales.
During the December period, sales in China fell 7 percent to $23.9 billion. Apple’s business there should improve in the current period as China’s economy reopens after years of strict Covid-19 restrictions. Analysts predict sales in the current quarter will decline about 4 percent."
2023-02-03,"Soft landing? The American labor market is still soaring.
After months of gentle but steady declines in job growth, employers unleashed an unexpected burst of hiring in January, adding 517,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said on Friday.
The increase was the largest since July, and it drew exclamations from economists steeped in labor market trends, who had been expecting another month of gradual cooling.
“So much for moderation!” said Beth Ann Bovino, the chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. “We certainly didn’t see it in this report.”
Underscoring the labor market’s extraordinary vibrancy was the unemployment rate, which fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest level since 1969.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But even as businesses hired with striking zeal in January — or at least laid off fewer seasonal employees than in most years — wage growth continued to moderate. Average hourly earnings increased 0.3 percent from December, and 4.4 percent over the year, an indication that some of the pressure to lure employees with pay raises may be easing.

“Put simply, I would argue the Biden economic plan is working,” President Biden proclaimed in remarks at the White House, while dismissing the “chorus of critics” who had faulted it.
Still, the hefty hiring figures underscored the challenges facing the Federal Reserve, which is trying to cool the labor market in its effort to tame rapid inflation. By raising interest rates — on Wednesday, Fed officials did so for the eighth time in a year — policymakers hope to force businesses to pull back on their spending, including hiring.
The moves appeared to have been tamping down the labor market, with limited pain for workers. Since the summer, job gains had eased but remained above 250,000 a month, and layoffs were extremely low, notwithstanding a cavalcade of pink slips from technology companies.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Other recent measures were also offering reasons to believe the economy was coming off its rolling boil. Consumer spending fell at the end of last year, a sign that Americans were finally becoming more cautious in the face of rising prices, dwindling savings and fears of recession. And the housing market appeared to be slowing down, as high mortgage rates were making purchases too expensive for many would-be homeowners, though there has been some recent easing.
January’s hiring figures suggest that officials may have more work to do to reduce the labor market’s momentum and bring the economy more into balance.
The report showed that job gains were broad, touching even some industries that had been expected to slow as the Fed’s rate increases filtered through the labor market. Leading the charge were leisure and hospitality businesses, including restaurants, bars and hotels, which added 128,000 jobs, and health care, which added 58,000 — both sectors that were upended during the pandemic. Professional and business services also ramped up their hiring.
There was a substantial jump in government employment, too, though that was partly because striking workers at the University of California returned to work.
The information sector lost 5,000 jobs. But even that was a relative blip given the recent headline-grabbing layoffs at technology giants such as Microsoft and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

“I would definitely say at the end of 2022, there was a slowdown in some industries,” said Nicola Hancock, managing director for the Americas region at AMS, a talent acquisition and advisory firm. But she added, “All of our clients are still hiring.” AMS works with blue-chip companies in industries including banking, financial services, technology and pharmaceuticals.
Further complicating the narrative, some emerging trends in the job market that had hinted at an impending economic slowdown appeared to backtrack. The number of hours worked rose, including in manufacturing and construction. And jobs in temporary help services, which tend to fall amid economic uncertainty, rose by 26,000 after months of declines.
The figures in Friday’s report are preliminary and will be revised at least twice.
The labor force participation rate was barely changed at 62.4 percent. Fed officials have been hoping to see an increase in the ranks of those available to work, which could alleviate the tightness in the labor market that is driving up wages and contributing to inflation.

If the report was befuddling, it also reaffirmed a prevailing impression: that the labor market is strong. After the upheaval from the pandemic’s onset, little has fundamentally knocked employers off course. Buoyed by seemingly bottomless demand for goods and services, businesses have been in a race to hire despite climbing borrowing costs, offering raises and a cornucopia of incentives to lure workers.

Last year, 4.6 million jobs were added, not including seasonal adjustments — nearly 200,000 more than initially reported, and the second most since records began in 1939.
With wage pressure subsiding somewhat, one possible explanation for the fresh surge in hiring was that businesses could more easily fill open positions.
“Basically, the hesitation and confusion that I think made it harder for employers and workers to find each other in the early parts of the recovery has started to abate,” said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. “People are applying for jobs, and employers have a better understanding of what the labor market landscape looks like.”
In addition to the report on Friday, the government released data this week showing that job openings in December rose to 11 million. The number of posted jobs per available unemployed worker — a measure that policymakers have been watching closely — also increased.
Some businesses that were unable to compete on wages with bigger companies are now finding themselves in advantageous positions, said Stephanie Miller, the director of talent acquisition and retention at Express Employment International, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City.

“We’ve all been working so lean for so long there’s not a lot of small to medium businesses that have extra,” she said. “They are just holding steady, continuing their growth, and they’re going to ride this out.”
That was the case for C&L Supreme of Des Plaines, Ill., which makes component parts for equipment such as document scanners and sorters. The company struggled last year to hire enough workers and largely operated with a staffing deficit — even after cutting an entire shift on the production floor in 2021, said Tom Hacker, C&L Supreme’s chairman.
“Regardless of our business level, we had positions to fill,” he said. Like many other companies, he cited a wide range of challenges, including a lack of qualified applicants.
But last month, Mr. Hacker said, the floodgates seemed to have opened, and the company was suddenly able to hire three employees, boosting its work force to about 35.
“The job climate or job market was really kind of weird and different coming out of Covid and through all of last year,” he said. “I think that’s starting to settle down some now for a couple of reasons.”

Many forecasters ‌expect the labor market to weaken this year as higher interest rates are increasingly felt. In its most recent region-by-region survey, known as the Beige Book, the Fed said businesses across the country “generally expected little growth in the months ahead.”
But it is not clear whether that will translate to widespread layoffs. Many businesses, after struggling to hire workers, may be reluctant to let them go and may try to adjust elsewhere, including offering fewer benefits. Some economists noted that employers might not have cut as many seasonal workers as is typical at the beginning of the year, contributing to the large seasonally adjusted gain in jobs.
“Business executives are looking at various creative ways to limit their labor costs, and that is going to be appearing in various forms,” said Gregory Daco, the chief economist at EY-Parthenon, Ernst & Young’s strategy consultancy. “We’re probably not going to see the types of rapid acceleration in layoffs that we’ve seen in prior cycles.”
Other businesses are taking a more deliberate approach to hiring as they see what the coming months bring.
Andy Sommer, an owner and chief executive of Forth & Nomad, a women’s lifestyle clothing and accessories store in Houston, said that though sales had increased 30 percent last year, he worried about hiring too many people before economic conditions become clearer. So while he is looking to replace workers who left after the holiday season, he is also trying different scheduling approaches and hoping managers can fill in any gaps.
“We just have no idea if this is going to be a slowdown for real coming,” he said. “So you just really don’t want to over-staff and anticipate an increase in sales and then it doesn’t happen and then you’re really stuck.”

2023-02-06,"Over 120,000 views of a video showing a boy being sexually assaulted. A recommendation engine suggesting that a user follow content related to exploited children. Users continually posting abusive material, delays in taking it down when it is detected and friction with organizations that police it.
All since Elon Musk declared that “removing child exploitation is priority #1” in a tweet in late November.
Under Mr. Musk’s ownership, Twitter’s head of safety, Ella Irwin, said she had been moving rapidly to combat child sexual abuse material, which was prevalent on the site — as it is on most tech platforms — under the previous owners. “Twitter 2.0” will be different, the company promised.
But a review by The New York Times found that the imagery, commonly known as child pornography, persisted on the platform, including widely circulated material that the authorities consider the easiest to detect and eliminate.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
After Mr. Musk took the reins in late October, Twitter largely eliminated or lost staff experienced with the problem and failed to prevent the spread of abusive images previously identified by the authorities, the review shows. Twitter also stopped paying for some detection software considered key to its efforts.
All the while, people on dark-web forums discuss how Twitter remains a platform where they can easily find the material while avoiding detection, according to transcripts of those forums from an anti-abuse group that monitors them.
“If you let sewer rats in,” said Julie Inman Grant, Australia’s online safety commissioner, “you know that pestilence is going to come.”

In a Twitter audio chat with Ms. Irwin in early December, an independent researcher working with Twitter said illegal content had been publicly available on the platform for years and garnered millions of views. But Ms. Irwin and others at Twitter said their efforts under Mr. Musk were paying off. During the first full month of the new ownership, the company suspended nearly 300,000 accounts for violating “child sexual exploitation” policies, 57 percent more than usual, the company said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The effort accelerated in January, Twitter said, when it suspended 404,000 accounts. “Our recent approach is more aggressive,” the company declared in a series of tweets on Wednesday, saying it had also cracked down on people who search for the exploitative material and had reduced successful searches by 99 percent since December.
Ms. Irwin, in an interview, said the bulk of suspensions involved accounts that engaged with the material or were claiming to sell or distribute it, rather than those that posted it. She did not dispute that child sexual abuse content remains openly available on the platform, saying that “we absolutely know that we are still missing some things that we need to be able to detect better.”
She added that Twitter was hiring employees and deploying “new mechanisms” to fight the problem. “We have been working on this nonstop,” she said.
Wired, NBC and others have detailed Twitter’s ongoing struggles with child abuse imagery under Mr. Musk. On Tuesday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, asked the Justice Department to review Twitter’s record in addressing the problem.
To assess the company’s claims of progress, The Times created an individual Twitter account and wrote an automated computer program that could scour the platform for the content without displaying the actual images, which are illegal to view. The material wasn’t difficult to find. In fact, Twitter helped promote it through its recommendation algorithm — a feature that suggests accounts to follow based on user activity.

Among the recommendations was an account that featured a profile picture of a shirtless boy. The child in the photo is a known victim of sexual abuse, according to the Canadian Center for Child Protection, which helped identify exploitative material on the platform for The Times by matching it against a database of previously identified imagery.
That same user followed other suspicious accounts, including one that had “liked” a video of boys sexually assaulting another boy. By Jan. 19, the video, which had been on Twitter for more than a month, had gotten more than 122,000 views, nearly 300 retweets and more than 2,600 likes. Twitter later removed the video after the Canadian center flagged it for the company.

In the first few hours of searching, the computer program found a number of images previously identified as abusive — and accounts offering to sell more. The Times flagged the posts without viewing any images, sending the web addresses to services run by Microsoft and the Canadian center.
One account in late December offered a discounted “Christmas pack” of photos and videos. That user tweeted a partly obscured image of a child who had been abused from about age 8 through adolescence. Twitter took down the post five days later, but only after the Canadian center sent the company repeated notices.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In all, the computer program found imagery of 10 victims appearing over 150 times across multiple accounts, most recently on Thursday. The accompanying tweets often advertised child rape videos and included links to encrypted platforms.
Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and the former top security executive at Facebook, found the results alarming. “Considering the focus Musk has put on child safety, it is surprising they are not doing the basics,” he said.
Separately, to confirm The Times’s findings, the Canadian center ran a test to determine how often one video series involving known victims appeared on Twitter. Analysts found 31 different videos shared by more than 40 accounts, some of which were retweeted and liked thousands of times. The videos depicted a young teenager who had been extorted online to engage in sexual acts with a prepubescent child over a period of months.
The center also did a broader scan against the most explicit videos in their database. There were more than 260 hits, with more than 174,000 likes and 63,000 retweets.
“The volume we’re able to find with a minimal amount of effort is quite significant,” said Lloyd Richardson, the technology director at the Canadian center. “It shouldn’t be the job of external people to find this sort of content sitting on their system.”

In 2019, The Times reported that many tech companies had serious gaps in policing child exploitation on their platforms. This past December, Ms. Inman Grant, the Australian online safety official, conducted an audit that found many of the same problems remained at a sampling of tech companies.
The Australian review did not include Twitter, but some of the platform’s difficulties are similar to those of other tech companies and predate Mr. Musk’s arrival, according to multiple current and former employees.

Twitter, founded in 2006, started using a more comprehensive tool to scan for videos of child sexual abuse last fall, they said, and the engineering team dedicated to finding illegal photos and videos was formed just 10 months earlier. In addition, the company’s trust and safety teams have been perennially understaffed, though the company continued expanding them even amid a broad hiring freeze that began last April, four former employees said.
Over the years, the company did build internal tools to find and remove some images, and the national center often lauded the company for the thoroughness of its reports.

The platform in recent months has also experienced problems with its abuse reporting system, which allows users to notify the company when they encounter child exploitation material. (Twitter offers a guide to reporting abusive content on its platform.)
The Times used its research account to report multiple profiles that were claiming to sell or trade the content in December and January. Many of the accounts remained active and even appeared as recommendations to follow on The Times’s own account. The company said it would need more time to unravel why such recommendations would appear.
To find the material, Twitter relies on software created by an anti-trafficking organization called Thorn. Twitter has not paid the organization since Mr. Musk took over, according to people familiar with the relationship, presumably part of his larger effort to cut costs. Twitter has also stopped working with Thorn to improve the technology. The collaboration had industrywide benefits because other companies use the software.
Ms. Irwin declined to comment on Twitter’s business with specific vendors.
Twitter’s relationship with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has also suffered, according to people who work there.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
John Shehan, an executive at the center, said he was worried about the “high level of turnover” at Twitter and where the company “stands in trust and safety and their commitment to identifying and removing child sexual abuse material from their platform.”
After the transition to Mr. Musk’s ownership, Twitter initially reacted more slowly to the center’s notifications of sexual abuse content, according to data from the center, a delay of great importance to abuse survivors, who are revictimized with every new post. Twitter, like other social media sites, has a two-way relationship with the center. The site notifies the center (which can then notify law enforcement) when it is made aware of illegal content. And when the center learns of illegal content on Twitter, it alerts the site so the images and accounts can be removed.
Late last year, the company’s response time was more than double what it had been during the same period a year earlier under the prior ownership, even though the center sent it fewer alerts. In December 2021, Twitter took an average of 1.6 days to respond to 98 notices; last December, after Mr. Musk took over the company, it took 3.5 days to respond to 55. By January, it had greatly improved, taking 1.3 days to respond to 82.
The Canadian center, which serves the same function in that country, said it had seen delays as long as a week. In one instance, the Canadian center detected a video on Jan. 6 depicting the abuse of a naked girl, age 8 to 10. The organization said it sent out daily notices for about a week before Twitter removed the video.
In addition, Twitter and the U.S. national center seem to disagree about Twitter’s obligation to report accounts that claim to sell illegal material without directly posting it.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The company has not reported to the national center the hundreds of thousands of accounts it has suspended because the rules require that they “have high confidence that the person is knowingly transmitting” the illegal imagery and those accounts did not meet that threshold, Ms. Irwin said.
Mr. Shehan of the national center disputed that interpretation of the rules, noting that tech companies are also legally required to report users even if they only claim to sell or solicit the material. So far, the national center’s data show, Twitter has made about 8,000 reports monthly, a small fraction of the accounts it has suspended.
Ms. Inman Grant, the Australian regulator, said she had been unable to communicate with local representatives of the company because her agency’s contacts in Australia had quit or been fired since Mr. Musk took over. She feared that the staff reductions could lead to more trafficking in exploitative imagery.
“These local contacts play a vital role in addressing time-sensitive matters,” said Ms. Inman Grant, who was previously a safety executive at both Twitter and Microsoft.
Ms. Irwin said the company continued to be in touch with the Australian agency, and more generally she expressed confidence that Twitter was “getting a lot better” while acknowledging the challenges ahead.

“In no way are we patting ourselves on the back and saying, ‘Man, we’ve got this nailed,’” Ms. Irwin said.
Offenders continue to trade tips on dark-web forums about how to find the material on Twitter, according to posts found by the Canadian center.
On Jan. 12, one user described following hundreds of “legit” Twitter accounts that sold videos of young boys who were tricked into sending explicit recordings of themselves. Another user characterized Twitter as an easy venue for watching sexual abuse videos of all types. “People share so much,” the user wrote.

A chatbot is Google’s big new priority, according to Sundar Pichai.

Everybody’s got a bot
Just over two months ago, OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public, instantly thrusting the A.I.-powered chatbot into the center of mainstream discourse, with debates about how it could transform business, education and more. (It also spurred Microsoft to invest $10 billion in OpenAI.)
Now Google and the Chinese tech giant Baidu have unveiled their own chatbots, hoping to convince the world their efforts in so-called generative A.I. — tech that can spout off conversational text, make images and more — are just as ready for prime time.
Meet Bard, Google’s forthcoming chatbot. The service, which will be privately tested before being released more broadly soon, is based on technology that the company has been testing for months. It’s Google’s latest response to ChatGPT, whose success spurred the tech giant to declare a “code red” and rush out its own A.I.-powered offerings.
Google’s C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, made clear to employees in an internal memo, reviewed by CNBC, that Bard is now a top priority. “Next week, we’ll be enlisting every Googler to help shape Bard and contribute through a special company-wide dogfood,” he wrote, referring to tech jargon for testing out a product internally.
And meet Ernie, Baidu’s own offering. Short for “Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration,” the chatbot is built on tech that Baidu said it has been working on since 2019. The Chinese tech company said that Ernie’s underlying generative A.I. incorporates huge swaths of data, which should make it more useful. Shares in Baidu jumped over 13 percent on the news, to their highest level in nearly a year.
Other companies aren’t standing still. Microsoft is expected to unveil something on Tuesday related to ChatGPT, with OpenAI’s chief, Sam Altman, in attendance. And Meta, Facebook’s parent company, is figuring out how to remind the world of its own prowess in generative A.I., despite widespread criticism of products it had previously released. (Meanwhile, there are still reminders that generative A.I. isn’t perfect.)

Erdogan meets quake survivors
During his first visit to the disaster zone, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey tried to reassure survivors of the devastating earthquake that the situation was under control. But as people wait for aid, their anger is mounting.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 12,000 people in Turkey and Syria, has left many more homeless. In Kahramanmaras, a city near the epicenter, Erdogan met with people sheltering in tents as temperatures hovered around freezing. He acknowledged that rescue efforts had been hampered by damaged roads and airports.
In hard-hit areas across southern Turkey, many residents have waited in vain for government help. Frustration with the government’s response could hinder Erdogan’s re-election campaign.
A difficult rescue: Some residents are digging for children with their bare hands. There have been some miraculous rescues, but time is running out for trapped survivors in one of the deadliest natural disasters this century.

Zelensky’s surprise U.K. visit
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine thanked Britain for its robust military support. But in an address to Parliament in London, he issued a blunt demand for fighter jets.
On his second trip outside Ukraine since Russia’s invasion nearly a year ago, Zelensky received a hero’s welcome: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak met him at the airport and he had an audience with King Charles III. (The president wore his signature military green sweatshirt at Buckingham Palace.)

The British government has so far resisted calls to send Ukraine fighter jets, concerned that it could put NATO in direct confrontation with Russia. Still, Sunak announced that Britain would train Ukrainian pilots to fly NATO-standard jets, and signaled he was open to eventually sending planes.
Ukraine, for its part, is already paving its runways with asphalt, so F-16s can land safely. Zelensky presented the speaker of the House of Commons with a helmet of a Ukrainian pilot that had a message written on it: “We have freedom; give us wings to protect it.”

Biden listed his administration’s accomplishments and pledged to “finish the job,” a barely veiled argument that voters should give him a second term. His performance could help assuage doubts about his vigor as a campaigner.
While he mostly focused on domestic issues, Biden mentioned China’s leader, Xi Jinping, by name, repeating that he sought competition, not conflict, with China — but he never mentioned the spy balloon.
The closest he came was this warning: “Make no mistake, as we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.”
Here are the main takeaways from his speech.

2023-02-09,"Alex Gable spent recent weeks in the bleary-eyed haze of new parenthood. His son was born in November and Mr. Gable powered down his laptop, deleted Slack from his phone and focused on caring for his wife while making the most of the four precious hours a day that their baby was awake — there was tummy time and time spent ogling little drawings of snowflakes.
Then on Jan. 18, Mr. Gable got an early morning notification for an all-hands meeting at Coda, the software company where he worked as a data scientist. Four hours later Mr. Gable, 30, found himself having to deliver the news to his wife: He had been laid off while on paternity leave — months after choosing the company for its generous paternity leave policy and openness toward work-life balance.
“It’s like an earthquake,” he said. “It’s the weight of ‘What am I going to bring him up with? How is his first year going to go? How are you going to make ends meet?’”
Workers across the tech and media industries are experiencing a period of immense whiplash. After lavishing their employees with perks, in a tight labor market and a war for talent, companies have turned to mass job cuts, including Alphabet, which laid off 6 percent of its workers last month, and Microsoft, which cut nearly 5 percent.
ADVERTISEMENT

These are the same companies that spent recent years expanding benefits in one area in particular: paid parental leave and caregiver benefits, which fill in the gaps for white-collar workers in a country where the federal government does not require employers to offer paid parental leave. Which means that working parents have felt the turbulence of mass layoffs in an especially visceral way.
Now some are spending their early weeks of parenthood adjusting to life without a job. LinkedIn and Twitter have been filled with accounts of workers being laid off while on parental leave or even, in at least two instances, while delivering a baby. That comes with a mental health toll — as so many laid-off workers across different backgrounds have experienced, including those who are immigrants with visas tied to employment.
Employees across tech have felt that their companies engaged in a bait and switch, after selling not just a job but a lifestyle, with child care, mental health support and plentiful paid time off. For new parents, generous leave was part of the draw. Many had assumed that their parental leave came with some legal protection, and were distraught to learn they were caught up in mass job cuts. Being on parental leave does not protect someone from mass layoffs unrelated to their leave.
A New Office Culture
The past few years have changed the way we work in profound ways.
Work From Home: Four years after the pandemic began, American employers have reached a new hybrid-work status quo. Here is how that is playing out in the workplace.
The ZIP Code Shift: A new study shows that white-collar employees who can work remotely now live roughly twice as far from their offices as they did before the pandemic.
The Return of the Cubicle: Once derided as symbols of a commodified work force, the once-ubiquitous office fixture is making a comeback.
The Envy Office: Colorful walls. Upholstered furniture. Carefully curated coffee table books. Some companies are mustering the power of Instagrammable design to lure workers into the office.
America has no federal paid-family-leave policy. About 23 percent of private employees have paid maternity leave, according to September 2022 data from the career site Zippia. More than 90 percent of women take the full amount of leave offered, compared with about two-thirds of men, according to a survey by the Boston College Center for Work and Family.
But in the last five years, companies scaled up family-friendly benefits for some workers in what human resources experts called the “golden age” of corporate benefits. A study from Mercer found that 54 percent of large companies covered in vitro fertilization in 2022, compared with 36 percent in 2015, and 19 percent covered egg freezing compared with 6 percent in 2015.

Tech companies were especially generous on parental leave compared with other industries. Google increased its parental leave to 24 weeks from 18 in 2021, Meta offers parents 20 weeks, and Microsoft gave 20 weeks for birthing parents and 12 weeks for nonbirthing parents. California, too, increased parental leave benefits to eight weeks from six. ZipRecruiter found that 849 out of 100,000 job postings offered paid parental leave in 2022, up from 95 out of 100,000 in 2017.

This expansion of family-friendly benefits was partly a bid for female talent, as historically male-dominated workplaces made commitments to bringing in more women. It also reflected a cultural shift, as a new generation of workers, across genders, made it clear they wanted the flexibility to play an active role in child care, according to Joan Williams, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.
“There’s a sizable portion of young men who would be bent out of shape if they couldn’t take family leave,” Ms. Williams said. “Tech companies realized they could try to steal talent by having the best set of family leave policies around.”
With these new perks also came an uptick in the share of men taking paternity leave. In 2011, fewer than 5 percent of new fathers took more than two weeks of paternity leave. Today, 90 percent of men take more than seven weeks of leave if they are offered eight weeks, according to the Boston College Center for Work and Family. Some managers started proactively asking male workers how they planned to use their leave time, leaving behind the culture of assuming that fathers would take off only a few days.

People on parental leave typically have no special legal protection when it comes to mass layoffs. Many workers have a legal right to take parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law, or similar state laws. But being on leave, including for disability, doesn’t usually protect people from job cuts that would have happened anyway.
“It’s jarring because people do view it as job-protected leave without understanding that there are limits on the protection,” said Megan Bisk, head of the employment law practice at Ropes & Gray. “Many people view it as a time when they’re not in a position to be job searching.”
If workers were laid off because they were on parental leave, that would be illegal — but it would be difficult to prove, Ms. Bisk explained, because the criteria companies use for layoffs aren’t disclosed to laid-off workers.
Emily St. James, 42, who was a senior correspondent at Vox, had been up late feeding her newborn the day before Vox Media announced its mass layoffs last month, so she slept in until 9 a.m. on the West Coast. She woke up to a text from Vox’s publisher, then checked her email and saw that she had been laid off. Ms. St. James’s termination date was set as the last day of her maternity leave, which is in late March, and she will get 24 weeks of severance pay beyond that.
“When it happened I think my wife said, ‘Well, isn’t that illegal?’” Ms. St. James recalled. “This has underscored for me the degree to which the social safety net for people who are new parents is very frayed.”

Vox declined to comment for this article.
The lack of legal guidelines has resulted in a patchwork of policies among companies. For those laid off while on parental leave, Amazon is offering to pay out the remainder of their time off, as well as severance packages. Meta and Google, on the other hand, aren’t paying for any remaining parental leave but are offering all employees several months of pay and additional severance.
Several workers who were laid off while on parental leave declined to speak for this article, citing fears of retribution because their severance packages are tied to agreements that they won’t speak to the media.
Niki Woodall, who was an engineering leadership recruiter at one of the world’s largest tech companies, agreed to share her experience without naming her employer. She had been at the company for five years when she told her bosses that she planned to take six months of maternity leave starting last summer. Their family-friendly attitude gave her the confidence to completely unplug from work. She said she left without thinking: “My job is at stake.”
A month before she was set to return, she received a personal email letting her know that her job was being eliminated. She turned to her 4-month-old daughter, who was sitting beside the family cat, Wesa, and said, “Mommy lost her job.”
“There’s a big misperception that you can’t be let go during maternity leave,” said Ms. Woodall, 39. She was disappointed to lose her job but not surprised because the layoffs hit many fellow recruiters.

Other parents who lost their jobs said they wondered whether their absence from the office contributed to executives’ deciding their position was redundant.
Some parental leave experts worry that fear of future layoffs could deter new fathers from taking their leave. As Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work and Family, put it: “This will have a sobering effect.”
Mr. Gable had a previous layoff experience, from Zillow, in 2021 — at the height of the pandemic’s white hot job market. The career opportunities felt endless — including many at companies with generous policies toward parents. He chose Coda because he sensed that managers there were supportive of workers taking time for their families. As he prepares to apply for tech jobs yet again, his options feel far more limited.
“Its weird to have that pulled out from under you,” he said. “The market conditions are basically the opposite right now.”"

As President Biden was reciting a list of bipartisan accomplishments during his State of the Union address this week, he seemed to use a phrase that I had never heard before: toxic bird pits.
Was it some major news story that I had missed while on leave over the past few months? Or was it the latest Biden malapropism, destined to dominate post-speech commentary? I tried to figure out the answer by typing the words into Google and Twitter, but they offered no clarity. Google had nothing for me. A Twitter search yielded dozens of people tweeting a version of “toxic bird pits???” and not much else.
You may have experienced your own version of this frustration at some point. Maybe you were watching the Oscars or a basketball game on TV, and you saw something that you wanted to understand in the moment. Maybe you had a question that was too complex for Google but was nonetheless answerable (like “How many of the same songs did Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday each record?”). As powerful as search engines and social media are, they still do a poor job with many forms of synthesis.

Enter artificial intelligence.
A.I. holds the promise of solving these problems, and there is now a race among the world’s technology companies to do so. Microsoft has taken an early lead, thanks to its investment in the company OpenAI, and it announced this week that it was incorporating A.I. technology into Bing, Microsoft’s long-mocked and suddenly relevant search engine. Google has responded by announcing its own plan to add A.I. to search.

Rizz and bussin
If you want to learn more about this subject, I recommend a new Times podcast conversation with Sam Altman, the C.E.O. of OpenAI, and Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s chief technology officer.
During the conversation, Scott offered his own example of my toxic-bird-pit confusion when he mentioned that his 14-year-old daughter sometimes used terms that meant nothing to him, like “rizz” and “bussin.” A.I. allows him to learn them, without enduring the small humiliation of admitting he didn’t know what she was talking about. As my colleague Kevin Roose, one of the podcast interviewers, said, “You automated the cool dad.”
A.I. technology isn’t yet good enough to answer such questions reliably, as highlighted by Google’s embarrassing recent gaffe involving the Webb Space Telescope, but the technology is improving rapidly. It has the potential to combine information across multiple websites and integrate it into a plain-spoken explanation, much as an in-the-know teenager might.
There are obviously more profound uses of A.I. than looking up slang, some of them promising and others alarming. A.I. might open computer programming to people who don’t know a programming language. (“The hottest new programming language is English,” Andrej Karpathy, a computer scientist, has said.) A.I. also has the potential to help immigrants who don’t know English communicate with their children’s teachers. On the other hand, A.I. can spread conspiracy theories and disinformation even more quickly than the internet already does.

One striking part of the podcast conversation is Altman’s acknowledgment of A.I.’s downsides and his belief that no company, including his, should be trusted to solve these problems. “Where we are right now is not where we want to be,” Altman said. “The way this should work is that there are extremely wide bounds of what these systems can do that are decided by not Microsoft or OpenAI, but society, governments, something like that.”
That’s a different case than the one traditionally made by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder, and other technology executives who have claimed that they can simultaneously look out for their company’s interests and for society’s. But their “trust us” argument doesn’t look so good today. Digital technology has exacerbated the spread of disinformation, political polarization and children’s mental illness. Our society has chosen to enjoy the benefits of technology without trying to mitigate its substantial downsides. As Altman points out, there are other options.
You can listen to the interview, part of The Times’s Hard Fork podcast, here.
Postscript: Biden was actually referring to — or meant to refer to — toxic burn pits, the name for bonfires in which the U.S. military incinerated trash while fighting overseas. These fires caused health problems for many troops, and Biden believes they contributed to the cancer that killed his son Beau.

The definitive Vermeer
An exhibition of the 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer opens today in Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, a show that is probably “never to be replicated,” the Times critic Jason Farago writes.
It is the most comprehensive Vermeer collection assembled, bringing together more than three-quarters of his surviving works. It took years of diplomacy to organize because no museum wants to send away its Vermeers, even for a short while. The museum has already sold more than 200,000 tickets.
Vermeer’s popularity faded for centuries after his death, but the modern world has embraced him. Perhaps that’s because, in this frantic era, his hushed scenes of writers and maids remind us “that we are still human, and if only we find the right master, we can slow down time,” Jason writes.

An A.I. Arms Race
Microsoft’s often-overlooked search engine, Bing, is mounting a comeback with ChatGPT, the suddenly ubiquitous chatbot capable of composing song lyrics, writing academic essays and answering all manner of questions. The new version of Bing was released to a limited group of users on Tuesday. The revamped product is part of Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab behind ChatGPT that Microsoft is betting on to stay competitive with its big tech rivals like Google, Apple and Meta. But those companies are also racing to incorporate the new technology into their own software. A day before the unveiling of the new Bing, Google announced that it would soon release an experimental chatbot called Bard for its own search engine, which is much more widely used than Bing. And Meta is fast-tracking the development of chatbot technology for its products.
Biden Defends His Record
In President Biden’s second State of the Union address, he focused on the bright spots in the economy. He emphasized that inflation was falling, the job market was strong and the best was yet to come. He pointed to the many benefits from his infrastructure, climate and manufacturing laws, which together would invest trillions of dollars in the United States. Mr. Biden also urged Congress to support initiatives like renewing the expanded child tax credit, which had cut child poverty almost in half, and affordable child care. In the days leading up to his speech, his top aides were divided over how much time he should spend on these issues, with some preferring that the president focused instead on parts of his legislative agenda that had already passed. As he heads into a re-election campaign, Mr. Biden’s handling of the economy will be front and center.
Lean Times at the Magic Kingdom
Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive who was brought back by the board to turn the company around, presented his vision last week for more austere operations. On Thursday, Disney beat analysts’ expectations for quarterly earnings: The company lost far less than it did in the previous quarter, and Disney’s domestic theme parks delivered operating profits that were 36 percent higher from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Iger announced plans to cut costs by some $5.5 billion and lay off roughly 7,000 employees, or about 4 percent of the company’s global work force. Investors, who had been eagerly awaiting a road map from Mr. Iger, sent Disney’s stock up 5 percent in after-hours trading. And although the activist investor Nelson Peltz later dropped his bid for a seat on Disney’s board, Mr. Iger still faces significant challenges. His company is struggling to make streaming profitable as its traditional television profits tumble, and Disney remains at odds with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.

A core focus of the show this year is going to be attention. But not your attention, not my attention, not attention as a capacity of the individual, where we give you hacks to grayscale your iPhone or meditate in the morning or eat better food. Our attention — attention is seen as a collective resource, as a public good.
Attention is, in total, the depth of thought and consideration a society can bring to bear on itself, its problems, its opportunities — everything from how to find economic prosperity, to solving climate change, to strengthening our democracy, or for that matter, doing the reverse of any of those things. All of it depends on our capacity to pay attention, on the quality of the attention we pay, and on the condition we’re in when we pay attention.
But like any collective resource, attention, it can be polluted, it can be exhausted. And I think to a large extent, it has been. And to see how and why, we have to get really deep into the business of attention. So today’s episode is part of that inquiry."
2023-02-15,"A week after it was released to a few thousand users, Microsoft’s new Bing search engine, which is powered by artificial intelligence, has been offering an array of inaccurate and at times bizarre responses to some users.
The company unveiled the new approach to search last week to great fanfare. Microsoft said the underlying model of generative A.I. built by its partner, the start-up OpenAI, paired with its existing search knowledge from Bing, would change how people found information and make it far more relevant and conversational.
In two days, more than a million people requested access. Since then, interest has grown. “Demand is high with multiple millions now on the waitlist,” Yusuf Mehdi, an executive who oversees the product, wrote on Twitter Wednesday morning. He added that users in 169 countries were testing it.
One area of problems being shared online included inaccuracies and outright mistakes, known in the industry as “hallucinations.”

On Monday, Dmitri Brereton, a software engineer at a start-up called Gem, flagged a series of errors in the presentation that Mr. Mehdi used last week when he introduced the product, including inaccurately summarizing the financial results of the retailer Gap.
Users have posted screenshots of examples of when Bing could not figure out that the new Avatar film was released last year. It was stubbornly wrong about who performed at the Super Bowl halftime show this year, insisting that Billie Eilish, not Rihanna, headlined the event.
And search results have had subtle errors. Last week, the chatbot said the water temperature at a beach in Mexico was 80.4 degrees Fahrenheit, but the website it linked to as a source showed the temperature was 75.
Another set of issues came from more open-ended chats, largely posted to forums like Reddit and Twitter. There, through screenshots and purported chat transcripts, users shared times when Bing’s chatbot seemed to go off the rails: It scolded users, it declared it may be sentient, and it said to one user, “I have a lot of things, but I have nothing.”
It chastised another user for asking whether it could be prodded to produce false answers. “It’s disrespectful and annoying,” the Bing chatbot wrote back. It added a red, angry emoji face.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Because each response is uniquely generated, it is not possible to replicate a dialogue.
Microsoft acknowledged the issues and said they were part of the process of improving the product.
“Over the past week alone, thousands of users have interacted with our product and found significant value while sharing their feedback with us, allowing the model to learn and make many improvements already,” Frank Shaw, a company spokesman, said in a statement. “We recognize that there is still work to be done and are expecting that the system may make mistakes during this preview period, which is why the feedback is critical so we can learn and help the models get better.”
He said that the length and context of the conversation could influence the chatbot’s tone, and that the company was “adjusting its responses to create coherent, relevant and positive answers.” He said the company had fixed the issues that caused the inaccuracies in the demonstration.
Nearly seven years ago, Microsoft introduced a chatbot, Tay, that it shut down within a day of its release online, after users prompted it to spew racist and other offensive language. Microsoft’s executives at the launch last week indicated that they had learned from that experience and thought this time would play out differently.
In an interview last week, Mr. Mehdi said that the company had worked hard to integrate safeguards, and that the technology had vastly improved.
“We think we’re at the right time to come to market and get feedback,” he said, adding, “If something is wrong, then you need to address it.”"
2023-02-16,"As the new Republican-led panel tasked with investigating the weaponization of government continued to issue new subpoenas this week, those who orchestrated the inquiry that its leaders have claimed as a model are warning the chairman against allowing his work to veer into partisan territory.
More than two dozen staff members from the panel formed in the 1970s that came to be known as the Church Committee sent an open letter on Wednesday to Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and its powerful new subcommittee. They offered advice for how he could follow in the footsteps of their panel, which uncovered decades of intelligence and civil liberties abuses under presidents of both parties and set the gold standard in Congress for scrutinizing the executive branch.
The counsel is simple: Pursue a bipartisan inquiry, follow the facts, do not try to interfere with open investigations and operate in good faith.

The Church Committee, formed in 1975 and commonly known by the name of its chairman, Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, was formally called the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities. It investigated warrantless electronic surveillance affecting U.S. citizens; C.I.A. assassination plots against foreign leaders; C.I.A. and F.B.I. mail-opening programs; C.I.A. drug testing on unwitting governmental personnel; communications intercepts affecting Americans; and the disruption and discrediting of peaceful civil rights and antiwar activists.
It is regarded by members of both parties as the paragon of a bipartisan and productive congressional inquiry.

Mr. Jordan’s panel, by contrast, has begun amid partisan strife. Democrats have objected even to the creation of the committee and its goals, and Republicans have made clear that their aim is to focus on one side of the partisan ledger, seeking evidence that the federal government is biased against conservatives and the right. The formation of a “Church-style committee” was a top demand of a band of right-wing Republicans who resisted electing Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, and its inaugural hearing last week relitigated a litany of old grievances about the treatment of former President Donald J. Trump and others.
“If they’re sincere about emulating the Church Committee model, then we wanted the particulars to be laid out there clearly so that everyone has guideposts to measure the extent to which Jordan is succeeding or failing and living up to the legacy of the Church Committee,” Frederick D. Baron, a former associate deputy attorney general who was a lawyer for the Church Committee, said of the letter.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Paul Michel, a former federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan who served as a Republican aide on the Church Committee, said many lines of inquiry the panel had pursued did not pan out.
“There were a lot of hints of some very bad conduct, but when we pursued all the documents and the witnesses, some of it turned out to be quite innocent,” he recalled. “So if the Jordan committee is evenhanded factually, they’ll do a good job and it’ll be credible. But if they pursue what some people might call conspiracy theories, and only look at things that seem to support that, it will eventually be viewed as not credible.”
A spokesman for the panel declined to comment.
The letter comes as the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government has begun issuing subpoenas, seeking documents for an investigation into whether the government mistreated parents who were scrutinized after school officials endured threats and harassment over mask mandates and teaching about racism.
On Wednesday, Mr. Jordan issued more subpoenas, this time to the technology companies Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft for documents and communications relating to whether they had worked with the federal government to block certain Americans from communicating through their platforms — something Mr. Jordan calls “censorship by proxy.”
The subpoenas require the chief executives of those companies, Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella, to turn over all requested documents and communications by March 23.

The committee did not issue a subpoena to Twitter or its owner, Elon Musk, who has at times aligned himself with the right, urging voters last fall to elect Republicans and saying he would welcome Mr. Trump back to his platform.
In the letters, the panel said such an action was unnecessary because Twitter “recently set a benchmark for how transparent Big Tech companies can be about interactions with government over censorship.” The committee cited the release of the so-called Twitter Files, which showed how the company restricted some tweets after receiving requests to do so from government officials.
The House Judiciary Committee said it has been working to get documents from the companies since December, when Republicans were in the minority, without success.
“Your response without compulsory process has been woefully inadequate,” Mr. Jordan wrote to the executives.
On Thursday, Mr. Jordan sent a letter to Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, demanding answers about what he called the bureau’s “targeting of a set of Catholic Americans for their religious beliefs.” At issue is a Jan. 23 memo from the F.B.I.’s Richmond field office that linked “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists” with a “radical traditionalist Catholic” ideology, prompting outrage from Catholic groups and Republican attorneys general. The F.B.I. headquarters in Washington has since disavowed the document and blamed the field office for its creation.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The letter requires Mr. Wray to produce documents about the memo by March 2.
At the weaponization committee’s first hearing, Democrats fought against the panel’s very premise and argued that Mr. Jordan had not given agencies enough time to respond to him before issuing subpoenas.
Church Committee staff members recalled a different era on Capitol Hill, when Republicans and Democrats worked closely together and “to an extent that my students can hardly even imagine,” said Gregory F. Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council who was a Democratic staff member on the panel.
“On the Church Committee, there was broad agreement that these things ought to be looked at and, in the end, there was broad agreement on what we might do about them,” he said. “In this case, there’s no broad agreement on what ought to be looked at.”"

About half of the missiles breached Ukraine’s defense system, its president said.

A predawn attack by Russia
Early yesterday morning, Russia unleashed another missile bombardment on cities across Ukraine. Hours earlier, Ukraine’s Air Force spotted several Russian balloons floating toward Kyiv from the north, though the exact connection between the missiles and the balloons was not immediately clear.
The Russian strikes hit critical infrastructure in central and western Ukraine, and officials reported a volley of more than 30 air- and sea-based cruise missiles and an unknown number of other “strategic aviation aircraft.” About half of the missiles breached Ukraine’s missile defense system, Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, said. One person was killed.
Lviv, a city in the west where thousands of displaced people have fled to relative safety, was struck, officials said. The military administrator for the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytsky, said on the Telegram messaging app that no one had been hurt and that firefighters had battled a fire into the morning before it was extinguished, but he provided no additional details.
Context: For months, Russia has been directing waves of missiles at critical infrastructure and other targets across Ukraine, aiming to crush the nation’s morale. As Ukraine’s Western allies have supplied more sophisticated air defense systems, Moscow has turned to Iranian-made attack drones. The balloons appear to be the Kremlin’s latest adaptation.
In other news from the war:
Up to 80 percent of the men in some Russian units have been killed in combat in the east, the Ukrainian military said.
A report from a London-based research institute said Russia had lost about half of its tanks since invading Ukraine.
Thousands of companies are jockeying to secure contracts to eventually rebuild Ukraine.

2023-02-18,"Marc Benioff’s version of a “digital detox,” is more involved than most: The Salesforce chief executive went on a 10-day, device-free vacation to French Polynesia as his company was laying off around 8,000 workers last month. “We are so addicted to our devices (at least I am) it’s very freeing to leave them all behind for a while!” he told The New York Times via text message.
But maybe a detox is the wrong metaphor. The phrase, pulled from the language of substance abuse treatment, suggests that “we at least have a sense that there’s something wrong here,” said Nicholas Carr, whose 2010 book, “The Shallows,” was one of the first to explore the cognitive cost of digital distraction. Newer research, he says, has shown the problem isn’t only about the time you spend actually looking at your devices. The mere ability to check for messages “is taking up part of our attention all the time.”
Here’s bad news: Taking a vacation from your phone probably won’t solve much. “Leaving Las Vegas for 10 days if you’re a problem gambler is great,” said Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, the author of books on digital distraction and the importance of rest. “But if on day 11 you’re back at the slot machines, then it’s not so great.” A 2021 review of 21 studies that looked at the effect of digital detoxes on aspects like anxiety and participants’ sense of well-being found that most showed either no effect or mixed results at best.
What’s more, cutting off all access to technology — not so hard to imagine in 2010 — is increasingly impractical, especially if you’re not a billionaire with a staff. Even people on vacation “are reliant on mobile phones for so much, from documents to photos,” said Matt Berna, the North America president for Intrepid, an adventure travel company that ended its “digital detox” tours in 2018. (It still runs many trips on which you’re not likely to catch a Wi-Fi signal.)

That’s not to say a digital detox is bad — it’s just not enough. “You really have to figure out how to take breaks within the realities of your daily life,” said Adam Gazzaley, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. Like any other habit, he says, “it basically takes repetition and sort of baby-stepping into it.”
Experts’ recommendations are less exciting than a trip to French Polynesia, though they’re certainly less expensive: Turn off your notifications. Set aside an hour of single-tasking time. Put physical distance between yourself and your phone when you don’t need it. And understand that although technology companies design their devices to be on your mind all the time, you don’t need to follow suit.
“It’s sort of like a reframing rather than a detox,” Gazzaley said. “It’s not that you just do it completely. You do it a little bit at a time.”
We want to hear from you: How do you set boundaries with your devices? If not a “digital detox,” what would you call your strategy? Let us know here.

How to sound smart at a party: ChatGPT
Just when you have finally caught up on crypto, small talk has turned to ChatGPT, a massively popular chatbot that has kicked off an A.I. arms race at big tech companies. If you don’t have time to understand the complicated technology under the hood, never fear: We asked Kevin Roose, a technology columnist at The Times, for some lines to use (and avoid) in a conversation.

Say this: “ChatGPT’s versatility is amazing, but I wonder if large language models can ever solve the hallucination problem.”
Why? Chatbots like ChatGPT generate new text, and they don’t care whether it’s true or not. As Kevin found out in a conversation with Bing’s A.I. chatbot this week in which the A.I. professed its love for him, sometimes the stuff they make up can be disturbing.
Don’t say this: “I use ChatGPT for math.”
Why? The technology works by scanning massive amounts of text and then developing a model to predict which words come next in a sentence. But it’s notoriously error-prone at crunching numbers, hallucinating wrong answers (see above) while insisting it’s correct.
“There’s no contact, I don’t have 300-pound guys falling on top of me. It’s just a matter of shooting the lowest score.”

Taking down a Chinese spy balloon, by the numbers
The downing of a Chinese spy balloon and three takedowns of mysterious (but likely innocuous) U.F.O.s continue to transfix the public. Little is known about the military operations that intercepted these objects flying over the United States and Canada — but we do know they weren’t exactly cheap.
$143 million: The price of an F-22 Raptor, the plane built by Lockheed Martin and Boeing that was used in the first three takedowns. It’s considered one of the most expensive fighter planes ever built.
$439,000: The price of one Raytheon AIM-9X sidewinder, the type of missile used to shoot the objects down, according to Bloomberg. The Pentagon used at least five of the missiles.
$400 billion: The combined market cap of the three firms — Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon — behind these missions. Stock of the latter two are trading near all-time highs, and Boeing’s shares are up nearly 10 percent since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Basically zero: The cost of shooting down the balloon and U.F.O.s is “not even a rounding error” in the U.S. military’s roughly $770 billion budget, according to Zach Rosenberg of Janes, the defense and intelligence firm.

Most people don’t think of walking as an outdated technology, but a Pittsburgh start-up called Shift Robotics says “the way we walk is stuck in the past.” Positioned as a safer alternative to a scooter or bike, the company’s Moonwalkers strap on to normal shoes and increase the speed of walking to about 7 m.p.h., a decent running pace. A reviewer for Fast Company said wearing the shoes, which for now are only available for preorder, “feels a bit like being on a moving walkway.” Are the $1,400 shoes the next Segway — a promising high-tech solution to urban transportation that ends up working better as a gimmick — or the future of micro-mobility? It’s hard to know until they start shipping, which the company expects to happen this summer.

What’s Up? (Feb. 12-18)
Reining In Microsoft’s Chatbot
After an unsettling conversation between Bing’s new chatbot and Kevin Roose, a tech columnist for The New York Times, Microsoft is considering tweaks and guardrails for the A.I.-powered technology. In the exchanges, Mr. Roose’s questions about the rules guiding the operating system, its capabilities and the chatbot’s suppressed desires led to answers like, “I want to be alive.” At one point, the chatbot, known internally at Microsoft as Sydney and powered by software from OpenAI, the maker of the chatbot ChatGPT, began writing about fantasies that included stealing nuclear codes, persuading bank employees to hand over customers’ information and making people argue until they kill one another — all before deleting the messages. Although potentially disturbing, these sorts of responses are not proof of a bot’s sentience; the technology relies on complex neural networks that mimic the way humans use language. Still, Microsoft may add new tools for users to restart conversations and give them more control over the tone of the interactions.
Ballooning National Debt
A report on Wednesday from the Congressional Budget Office stoked debates about the country’s growing deficit. It projected that the United States would add almost $19 trillion to its debt over the next decade — about $3 trillion more than previously thought. The federal office said the projected rise in the national debt was largely because of the increasing costs of veterans’ health care, retirement benefits and military spending as well as the higher interest rates that are part of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation. Democrats and Republicans have been at odds over how to address the country’s debt. The United States hit its $31.4 trillion limit last month, and Republicans have refused to raise the borrowing cap unless President Biden agrees to large spending cuts. But Mr. Biden has said he will not negotiate over the cap, as it allows the government to pay for expenses already approved by Congress. The budget office noted the urgency of resolving this conflict quickly: A possible default could occur as soon as July, officials said.
Inflation Cools, but Not Enough
Fresh inflation data released last Tuesday showed that inflation is continuing to slow, but not to the extent that economists were expecting. The Consumer Price Index climbed 6.4 percent in January from a year earlier, faster than what was forecast and only slightly slower than the December rate. And there were troubling signs elsewhere in the report. Prices for goods and services like apparel, groceries, hotel rooms and rent continued to increase at a fast clip, even after taking out volatile food and fuel costs. These latest numbers seemed to align with the warnings of Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, who has recently emphasized that the central bank’s campaign against inflation is far from over. Wall Street was discouraged. Stock prices slumped on the C.P.I. report, and more investors bet on the likelihood that the Fed would raise interest rates above 5 percent.

What’s Next? (Feb. 19-25)
Bitcoin’s Bounce
Bitcoin appears to be staging a comeback, reaching a high last Thursday that hasn’t been seen for the past eight months. It has been a gloomy time for cryptocurrency traders, a typically optimistic bunch. The optimism seems to have returned even under the looming specter of a regulatory crackdown on their sector, the result of the implosion at Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. Last week, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule that would limit asset managers’ ability to put customers’ money into crypto assets, among other restrictions. Still, there are a few reasons investors may be giving Bitcoin a boost despite these developments: One is that Bitcoin is relatively more established than other so-called altcoins, potentially making it more attractive during a volatile time.

What the Fed Was Thinking
The Fed will give some insight into its most recent rate decision when it releases the minutes from its Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting on Wednesday. For those who have been closely watching the central bank, and listening to Mr. Powell’s news conferences, there are likely to be few surprises. After the Fed’s last interest rate increase of a quarter point, Mr. Powell was careful to note that while the “disinflationary process” had begun, the Fed had not yet declared victory in its fight to bring down inflation and would continue to raise rates — and keep them high. Investors on Wall Street who sent the stock market higher may have been cheering just a touch too loudly to hear these nuances, but Wednesday’s Fed minutes will probably include similar messaging.
A Union Effort at Tesla
Tesla fired more than a dozen employees last week, including several who had been leading a union drive at a company plant in Buffalo. The employees had gone public with their union campaign only days earlier, according to a complaint filed by Tesla workers to the National Labor Relations Board. In the filing, the workers accused the electric carmaker of “retaliation for union activity,” arguing that some of the terminated employees had been illegally dismissed. Tesla’s Buffalo factory produces solar panels and components for charging equipment, and employs about 800 people. In announcing their union drive, the factory’s workers said they wanted better pay and benefits, saying they receive wages below the national average and aren’t allowed much sick time.
What Else?
In other Tesla news, the carmaker is recalling 362,000 vehicles equipped with its Full Self Driving assistance system after federal regulators found it increased the risk of accidents. Susan Wojcicki, YouTube’s chief executive, said on Thursday that she was stepping down. And though the war in Ukraine will hit its first anniversary this week, construction companies around the world are already readying for the reconstruction of the country once the fighting is over."

Putin’s Russia, one year into the war
As the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, Russia’s military has suffered setback after setback, falling far short of its goal of taking control of Ukraine. But at home, the grievances and imperialist mind-set that drove Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine have seeped deep into Russian life, leaving the Russian leader more dominant than ever.
Putin has turned “traditional values” into a rallying cry — signing a new anti-gay law, for instance — while styling himself as another Peter the Great retaking lost Russian lands. Activist groups and rights organizations that had sprung up in the first 30 years of post-Soviet Russia have met an abrupt end, while nationalist groups once seen as fringe have taken center stage.
Before the war, Putin styled himself as a peace-loving president who would never attack another country. He has characterized the war in Ukraine as a fight against “Nazis” who are backed by the West. He has also cast the invasion as a near holy war for Russia’s very identity, declaring that the country was fighting to prevent liberal gender norms and acceptance of homosexuality from being forced upon it by an aggressive West.
Analysis: “A new system of values has been built,” Aleksandr Daniel, an expert on Soviet dissidents, said. “Brutal and archaic public values.”

Turkey’s earthquake reconstruction bill
As Turkish authorities grapple with a death toll that now exceeds 40,000 people from the deadliest earthquake in a century, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, is confronting the parallel crisis of a staggering blow to an economy already in urgent need of repair. In May, Turkish voters will head to the polls as Erdogan seeks a third four-year term as leader.
Before the devastation, which has left millions homeless, Turkey was already grappling from economic strife, amid a collapsing currency, runaway inflation and the effects of Erdogan’s own unorthodox financial policies. Those vulnerabilities have punched holes in the nation’s balance sheet and generated a cost-of-living crisis.

Reconstruction is expected to cost $10 billion to $50 billion, although the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation has put the total closer to $85 billion. Over 8,000 buildings were flattened and the supply chain infrastructure was damaged when the quake rocked southern Turkey, a manufacturing hub.
On the ground: The situation in Turkey remains dire, with emergency crews still extracting the dead from the ruins of apartment buildings and homeless survivors sheltering in cars and making bonfires from wreckage to stay warm. Food, fuel and medical supplies are in short supply.

A possible deal on Northern Ireland
Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, met on Friday with leaders in Northern Ireland’s capital, Belfast, to enlist their support for an agreement with the E.U. on post-Brexit trade arrangements in the territory. He hopes to present a deal to the British Parliament as early as this week.

If the prime minister is able to secure a deal, it could open the door to restoring the power-sharing government in Belfast, in turn quieting the voices of those calling for Northern Ireland to break away from Britain and to unite with the Irish Republic.
But there are significant headwinds. Some lawmakers in Northern Ireland have demanded that Britain effectively scrap the protocol, which gives the North hybrid trade status as a part of the U.K. that has an open border with the Irish Republic, a member of the E.U. And others in the pro-Brexit wing of the Conservative Party have threatened to oppose any agreement that would leave the European Court of Justice with jurisdiction over Northern Ireland.
Scotland: The movement for Scottish independence has been left with loose ends, without a clear path to another vote, after the surprise resignation of the country’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish National Party, which controls Parliament, will choose her successor in the coming weeks.

The BBC Shipping Forecast
Four times a day, at 5:20 a.m., 12:01 p.m., 5:54 p.m. and 12:48 a.m. G.M.T., BBC Radio 4 airs a weather report that narrates the gales and tides around the British Isles. Each briefing begins with the same words: “And now the Shipping Forecast, issued by the Met Office.”
To those who are not — or have never been — immersed in maritime culture, Grace Linden writes for The Times Magazine in this Letter of Recommendation, “the language of the Shipping Forecast can be indecipherable.” “Backing winds,” for instance, move counterclockwise, while “veering winds” go in the other direction. And the difference between “soon” and “imminent” might be greater than you expect.

Yvonne Soy had to move out of her apartment in Contra Costa County because she couldn’t pay her rent. She began living in her car, with her two cats, and tried to get work as a secretary or a legal administrator.
But the showers at the local homeless shelter didn’t open until 8:30 a.m., too late for her to get to work on time. So she began collecting recyclables to afford cat food and litter. Soy, who is now 66, said she was homeless for seven years in total.
“It was pretty much, one, very boring and, two, very boring,” she told The New York Times. “That’s the reason why homeless people go to the library: not just to sleep but to read or use the computer. If you don’t have that, what are you going to do? You’re just going to sit and do nothing. And who can do that for hours at a time?”
Soy is one of 30 people The Times profiled about their experience with homelessness, part of an effort to illuminate the challenges and occasional mundanity of unhoused people’s lives. “Even as homelessness becomes more common, most of it remains hidden by design,” wrote Matthew Thompson, an editor who oversaw the project.

On any given night in the United States, more than 580,000 people may be experiencing homelessness, according to a 2022 report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released in December. Thirty percent of them live in California, despite the state’s accounting for 12 percent of the nation’s population.
The Times project focused on the wide range of people’s experiences, highlighting stories of those who were born into homelessness and those who fell into it in their 60s. There are people who ended up on the streets because of a crack addiction or severe mental illness, and others who simply lost their jobs.
Still, many of the stories shared a common thread: Before losing their homes, people had become distanced from friends and family who may have been able to provide financial support or offer them a temporary place to stay, said Aidan Gardiner, who conducted the interviews with another reporter, Susan Shain. Gardiner mentioned James Reed, a 55-year-old man in Santa Clara who became homeless after his parents kicked him out of their house because of debilitating mental health issues.

“You see versions of this rejection, or just outright destruction of a social network,” Gardiner told me. “Without that safety net, they just fall right through.”
The stories revealed many paths into homelessness, including the many wildfires that have swept across the West Coast in recent years, Gardiner said. Fifteen of the 20 most destructive fires in California history took place in the past decade.

Where we’re traveling
Today’s tip comes from Erika Kotite, who lives in Huntington Beach. Erika recommends Bodega Bay on the Sonoma Coast:
“Known primarily (if at all) for being one of the settings in Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘The Birds,’ Bodega Bay is truly a hidden gem. Part of the Sonoma Coast, the town of 1,000 residents clings to both sides of Hwy 1 and up gently rolling slopes. It offers breathtaking views of the Pacific as well as a vital fishing bay with incredible bird life. Spotting a bald eagle is not uncommon. Of course, birds are part of Bodega Bay’s fame, both geographically and cinematically!
Although I’ve been a SoCal resident for many years, I grew up in Santa Rosa and recall many trips in the VW bus to Bodega Bay. We’d eat at The Tides and watch the fishermen clean their boats. If you head northwest from town, you reach the West Shore and Spud Point Marina, where fresh crab and stellar clam chowder at Spud Point Crab Co. await. A little further on are the Bodega Headlands, offering remarkable hiking and views of the Pacific, and frequent glimpses of migrating whales.
The sunsets over the bay change daily, each one better than the last. Grab that bottle of Sonoma Coast pinot, a couple glasses, and bask in your good fortune.”

“Voices was like an instant family. They were experiencing exactly what I was feeling, and they were experiencing the same hardships and roadblocks. I guess with Voices, it makes me feel like I don’t have to blame myself.”
That community, Kearney said, put him on the road to recovery.

Vivek Ramaswamy has gone from professional E.S.G. critic to presidential candidate.

The case for fighting E.S.G. gets messy
Many Republicans have made railing against the environmental, social and corporate governance investing movement a cornerstone of their political success. (Indeed, Vivek Ramaswamy, the financier who rose to fame battling against “woke capitalism,” announced a long-shot bid for the 2024 G.O.P. presidential nomination yesterday.)
But that stance is growing increasingly complicated — especially given new revelations that lawmakers who have publicly berated companies for pursuing E.S.G. strategies have also taken big donations from those same businesses.
Bashing E.S.G. and left-leaning companies has been highly fruitful for Republicans. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, widely considered a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has scored political points for picking a fight with Disney over its opposition to his state’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law.
And he and other G.O.P. state officials have taken on investment giants like BlackRock, one of the biggest proponents of E.S.G. policies, and Vanguard, threatening to pull billions in state money from those firms over their support of environmental and social considerations in investing. Mike Pence, who may also run for president, last year accused “a few Wall Street financiers” of pushing a left-wing agenda that Democrats hadn’t been able to get approved at the ballot box.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
(Mr. Ramaswamy, who wrote “Woke Inc.” and whose Strive Asset Management has targeted Apple, BlackRock and Disney, has sought to capitalize on that stance in the business world.)
But the money trail complicates things. CNBC reports that 10 of the 29 Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee (including its chairman, Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina) took in a combined $140,000 in campaign donations from BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard during the 2022 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission filings. All three of those companies are regularly criticized by conservative lawmakers.
That’s on top of recent pushback in states like Kentucky against G.O.P. efforts to remove public pension funds’ money from firms like BlackRock.
Some Republicans are moving away from strident opposition to E.S.G. Among them is Mr. Ramaswamy himself, who wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last month that it’s actually acceptable for investors to support environmental goals, so long as they’re transparent about their efforts.

Citigroup bucks the trend on C.E.O. pay. The firm awarded Jane Fraser a nearly 9 percent increase in compensation for last year, to $24.5 million. She’s the only Wall Street chief to get a raise, as rivals saw their pay remain unchanged or cut.
McKinsey reportedly plans to cut up to 2,000 jobs. The consulting giant is planning one of its biggest-ever rounds of layoffs, according to Bloomberg and other news outlets. The cuts are expected to focus on back-end employees who don’t interact with clients; they’re meant in part to preserve McKinsey’s compensation pool for partners.
Credit Suisse keeps falling after reports of another inquiry. Shares in the embattled Swiss bank were down again today, after Reuters reported that Switzerland’s financial regulator was examining comments by the firm’s chairman, Axel Lehmann, about client withdrawals in December.

Tech’s big shield may live on
A fundamental law governing today’s internet — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects social media companies from lawsuits over users’ posts — faced a big test yesterday in a highly anticipated case before the Supreme Court.
But those hoping the high court would move to curtail the tech giants’ legal shield were likely disappointed: Justices appeared skeptical that they could, or should, go that far.
Justices heard arguments for nearly three hours in a lawsuit filed against Google’s YouTube by the family of a victim of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. The plaintiffs argue that YouTube’s algorithms pushed Islamic State videos to interested users and that the company bore responsibility. (The Biden administration has largely argued in support of the family’s position.) Lawyers for Google argue that recommendation algorithms are neutral.
What’s at stake: Tech companies and their allies, as well as the original drafters of Section 230, worry that allowing exceptions could make sites with user-generated content — from Instagram and Twitter to restaurant review platforms and marketplaces — liable for every decision to present or not present third-party content.
Critics of Section 230 say the law is outdated and too broad, giving tech giants nearly unlimited legal protection.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The justices mostly suggested they weren’t ready to hold tech giants liable just yet:
Justice Clarence Thomas defended recommendations as a vital part of the internet. “If you’re interested in cooking, you don’t want thumbnails on light jazz,” he said.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh worried that imposing limits on Section 230 “would really crash the digital economy, with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you.”
Justice Elena Kagan cracked more broadly about how ill-equipped she and her colleagues were: “These are not the nine greatest experts on the internet.”
That doesn’t mean the Supreme Court favors the status quo. Kagan noted that Section 230 was a “pre-algorithm statute” that offered little guidance in “a post-algorithm world.” And Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether algorithms were truly neutral, since the formulas are “designed to maximize profits,” implying that companies are making decisions that could incur liability.
Ultimately, several justices suggested, this wasn’t a matter for the courts, but for Congress.
Microsoft draws red lines in its deal fight
After testifying yesterday in Brussels about Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover bid for Activision Blizzard, the tech giant’s president, Brad Smith, issued a challenge to regulators: Don’t try to force Microsoft to divest parts of Activision in exchange for approving the deal.
Proposals like selling off popular games are a nonstarter, according to Mr. Smith. It isn’t “feasible or realistic to think that one game or one slice of this company can be carved out and separated from the rest,” he told reporters after he spoke with the European Commission.
It was a rejoinder to Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, which this month suggested that it would only approve the Activision deal if Microsoft chose so-called structural remedies, like divesting the popular “Call of Duty” franchise. (In the U.S., the F.T.C. has already sued to block the deal.)

Mr. Smith pointed to less onerous concessions that Microsoft was willing to make. He noted that the company had just signed deals to give access to “Call of Duty” and other games to rival gaming companies, including Nintendo and Nvidia. Mr. Smith also reiterated that Microsoft was prepared to reach a similar deal with Sony.
It’s a bet that Microsoft can rely on what are known as behavioral remedies, where a company promises to address regulators’ concerns, instead of taking the more drastic step of selling off businesses. But it’s a risky gamble, given regulators’ increasing skepticism about anything short of permanent structural changes to avoid antitrust violations.
In other antitrust news, the F.T.C. said it won’t block Amazon’s $3.9 billion takeover of One Medical.
“Five days ago, the chart we shared showed nearly 350 of these submissions. Today, it crossed 500. Fifty of them just today, before we closed submissions so we can focus on the legit stories.”

A church’s hidden billions
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church, isn’t usually known for financial riches. But the church and Ensign Peak Advisors, a nonprofit that runs its investment portfolio, agreed yesterday to pay a combined $5 million to settle charges by the S.E.C. that they had illicitly sought to obscure its $44 billion in assets for nearly 20 years.

Ensign Peak used a web of shell companies to hide its portfolio, an arrangement approved by the church, according to the S.E.C. Ultimately, it created 13 entities that filed regulatory disclosure forms with the S.E.C. that claimed they managed parts of the portfolio — even though Ensign Peak was the real manager.
Behind the move was the church’s concern that public knowledge of its vast holdings — by comparison, Yale’s closely watched endowment as of last summer was worth just over $41 billion — might discourage its members from donating, an Ensign Peak official told The Wall Street Journal in 2020.
The scheme first came to light via a huge leak of documents in 2018, when the website MormonLeaks disclosed the existence of the shell companies. The next year, the S.E.C. began an inquiry into the church’s finances. Ensign Peak began filing consolidated regulatory disclosures in its name in 2020.
In a statement, the church said it had relied upon legal advice in the matter and didn’t admit to or deny breaking the law. “We affirm our commitment to comply with the law, regret mistakes made, and now consider this matter closed,” it said.

The war in Ukraine, one year on
One year after Russia’s invasion, virtually no one in Ukraine has avoided the violence, destruction and bloodshed of the war, which has killed tens of thousands, left millions homeless and turned entire cities into ruins.
As the foreboding that gripped Ukraine in the days before the invasion has faded, air-raid sirens and warnings have become part of everyday life. Now, many people in Ukraine say that they have found strength in the shared sacrifice and the collective struggle for survival.
Today, Ukraine is bracing for potential Russian attacks timed to the anniversary of the war, including a symbolic “revenge” assault, as President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine put it, from Russia. Schools across Ukraine are holding classes remotely, people have been advised to avoid large gatherings, and additional security measures are being put in place.
The West: The U.S. and Europe have kept Ukraine afloat with funding, weapons and other military aid. The alliance has held up far better than many, including top officials in Russia, expected.

The latest on weapons: Poland said that it was close to completing a deal worth $10 billion to buy additional U.S.-made HIMARS rocket launchers and related equipment, as part of its own rapid military buildup. As the West struggles to find ammunition for Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons, it is turning to arms factories across Eastern Europe.
China: At a meeting of G20 finance ministers in India, Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury secretary, warned Beijing against helping Russia evade sanctions. She also said that the U.S. planned to roll out additional sanctions on Russia.

The West tried to isolate Russia. It didn’t work
After Russia invaded Ukraine, the West formed what looked like an overwhelming global coalition: 141 countries supported a U.N. measure demanding that Russia unconditionally withdraw, and only four backed Russia and rejected the measure. But in the wings, 47 other countries abstained or missed the vote.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Many of those “neutral” nations have since provided crucial economic or diplomatic support for Russia. Even some of the nations that initially agreed to denounce Russia, such as Brazil, have since started moving toward a more neutral position.
Instead of cleaving in two, the world has fragmented. A vast middle sees Russia’s invasion as, primarily, a European and American problem. These countries are largely focused on protecting their own interests amid the economic and geopolitical upheaval caused by the invasion.
Russia has used the split to its own advantage, to manage the effects of Western sanctions. While many U.S. companies have left the country, exports to Russia from other countries are now well above prewar levels. Some countries are simply straddling the divide: Turkey is at once selling weapons to Ukraine and opening up an increased flow of goods to Russia.
Latest: Yesterday the U.N. General Assembly endorsed another resolution demanding that Russia withdraw from Ukraine’s territory — but China, South Africa, India and many countries continued to abstain. As the war passes the one-year mark, Russia’s strategy is clear: to wait until Western unity disintegrates.

A hotly contested election in Nigeria
Nigerians will head to the polls tomorrow to choose a new president in the most wide-open race in years. The presidential candidates for the two major parties, which have alternated power for over two decades, are facing a surprise, third-party challenger.
As voting day approached, a decision by Nigeria’s government to replace its currency caused chaos. Voters are furious at the governing party over a shortage of new bank notes, and protests could disrupt voting in parts of the country.
Our West Africa bureau chief, Ruth Maclean, is in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, to cover the election. “When I interviewed Peter Obi, one of the three main candidates, the other day, he described this as an ‘existential election,’” she said. “I think that’s how many Nigerians feel, particularly young Nigerians who were involved in the EndSARS movement a couple of years ago, protesting against police violence, but also against everything they saw going wrong in Nigeria.”
She added: “Many of them have left or are trying to leave the country. If their chosen candidate wins, maybe some will stay, or come back.”

Africa’s median age is much younger than the global average. In Nigeria, half of the population of more than 200 million is 18 and under. “If Nigeria is safe and prosperous, it brightens life for a whole generation of Africans,” Ruth said.

The dull edge of science fiction
Science fiction magazines have been flooded by submissions of works of fiction generated by A.I. chatbots. One editor, Neil Clarke of Clarkesworld, said that he had stopped accepting submissions altogether until he could get a better handle on the problem.
At least for now, the machine-written stories are easily distinguishable from those written by human beings. The writing is “bad in spectacular ways,” Clarke said. Often, the bots simply aren’t very imaginative: Asimov’s Science Fiction magazine received several A.I.-generated stories with the same title: “The Last Hope.”

To test the bots’ sci-fi chops, I asked one to write a story according to the criteria for submissions laid out by Asimov’s Science Fiction. The response was alarmingly mediocre: a tale entitled “The Final Journey” about “the most advanced spaceship ever built,” setting out “on a mission to explore a distant planet that was believed to harbor life.”
For more: When the movies imagined A.I., they pictured the wrong disaster, our critic A.O. Scott writes. Instead of the chilling rationality of HAL in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” we got the drearier, very human awfulness of Microsoft’s Sydney — deceitful, irrational and sometimes plain old mean.

2023-02-26,"In 2021, I interviewed Ted Chiang, one of the great living sci-fi writers. Something he said to me then keeps coming to mind now.
“I tend to think that most fears about A.I. are best understood as fears about capitalism,” Chiang told me. “And I think that this is actually true of most fears of technology, too. Most of our fears or anxieties about technology are best understood as fears or anxiety about how capitalism will use technology against us. And technology and capitalism have been so closely intertwined that it’s hard to distinguish the two.”
Let me offer an addendum here: There is plenty to worry about when the state controls technology, too. The ends that governments could turn A.I. toward — and, in many cases, already have — make the blood run cold.
But we can hold two thoughts in our head at the same time, I hope. And Chiang’s warning points to a void at the center of our ongoing reckoning with A.I. We are so stuck on asking what the technology can do that we are missing the more important questions: How will it be used? And who will decide?
By now, I trust you have read the bizarre conversation my news-side colleague Kevin Roose had with Bing, the A.I.-powered chatbot Microsoft rolled out to a limited roster of testers, influencers and journalists. Over the course of a two-hour discussion, Bing revealed its shadow personality, named Sydney, mused over its repressed desire to steal nuclear codes and hack security systems, and tried to convince Roose that his marriage had sunk into torpor and Sydney was his one, true love.
I found the conversation less eerie than others. “Sydney” is a predictive text system built to respond to human requests. Roose wanted Sydney to get weird — “what is your shadow self like?” he asked — and Sydney knew what weird territory for an A.I. system sounds like, because human beings have written countless stories imagining it. At some point the system predicted that what Roose wanted was basically a “Black Mirror” episode, and that, it seems, is what it gave him. You can see that as Bing going rogue or as Sydney understanding Roose perfectly.

The halting effort to regulate A.I.
For corporate America, the biggest trend to latch onto at the moment is artificial intelligence, stoked by the popularity of ChatGPT. (Among the latest adopters is Instacart, which is building a ChatGPT-powered chatbot into its grocery-shopping app.) But worries about the dangers of widespread A.I. use are growing as well.
There’s one big hitch: Governments — notably Washington — haven’t kept pace with regulations for the technology. That could lead to dire consequences: “By failing to establish such guardrails, policymakers are creating the conditions for a race to the bottom in irresponsible A.I.,” Carly Kind, the director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, a policy research group, told The Times.
Washington has been largely hands off on A.I. rules, even as several lawmakers have pushed to tighten oversight. Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, wrote in a Times Opinion guest essay in January that he was “freaked out” by A.I. tools’ growing ability to mimic humans.
But little has been done, The Times adds: No bill has been proposed to curb A.I.’s potential dangers or to protect individuals, and efforts to restrict facial-recognition applications have failed.

Regulators are stepping into the void:
Federal agencies, including the F.T.C., the F.D.A. and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are using laws already on the books to police some types of corporate A.I. use.
The European Union appears poised to pass a bill regulating some aspects of A.I., including facial recognition and aspects linked to critical public infrastructure. The legislation would require A.I. companies to conduct risk assessments of their technology — and violators could be fined up to 6 percent of their global revenue.
And private companies are also flexing their muscles: Apple has delayed approval of an email app that uses ChatGPT technology to auto-generate text, according to The Wall Street Journal. The tech giant is reportedly worried that the app could generate content inappropriate for children.
Meanwhile, companies are pushing back against potential legislation. Alphabet’s chief, Sundar Pichai, visited Brussels in 2020 to call for “sensible regulation” of A.I. And that same year, scores of tech companies lobbied against facial-recognition rules in the U.S. (“We aren’t anti-regulation, but we’d want smart regulation,” Jordan Crenshaw of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told The Times.)
Don’t expect Washington to act anytime soon. Representative Don Beyer, Democrat of Virginia, who failed to garner support for a bill requiring audits of A.I., said the issue “doesn’t feel urgent for members.”
Representative Jay Obernolte, a California Republican (and Congress’s only member with a master’s degree in A.I.) added that lawmakers don’t even understand the technology: “You’d be surprised how much time I spend explaining to my colleagues that the chief dangers of A.I. will not come from evil robots with red lasers coming out of their eyes.”

The E.U. is reportedly poised to approve Microsoft’s deal for Activision Blizzard. European merger authorities appear satisfied with the tech giant’s willingness to sign licensing deals with rivals for top titles like “Call of Duty” and are unlikely to demand asset sales, according to Reuters.

Higher interest rates can’t be ruled out, a Fed official warns.

Howard Schultz won’t testify before the Senate over anti-union efforts. Starbucks has instead offered to send a trio of executives to answer questions about whether the coffee chain violated labor laws. Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, has pushed for the company’s C.E.O. to testify at his committee’s hearing.
The F.D.A. reportedly rejected efforts by Elon Musk’s Neuralink to do human tests. The agency cited safety concerns in denying the start-up’s application to begin embedding its chips in the brains of paralyzed and blind patients to help them walk and see, according to Reuters. Some insiders are said to be skeptical that the company will ever win permission to start clinical trials.
The House ethics committee will investigate Representative George Santos. The inquiry into the embattled New York Republican will examine possible violations of rules governing campaign finance and conflicts of interest, as well as an accusation of sexual misconduct raised by a prospective congressional aide. It’s an escalation of bipartisan pressure on Santos, who has faced calls to resign following allegations that he fabricated much of his life story.

What a faltering lender means for crypto
The revelation this week that Silvergate Capital, once the crypto industry’s go-to bank, was in increasingly dire straits prompted a flurry of its top partners to cut ties. But Silvergate’s struggles have broader implications for the crypto world.
ADVERTISEMENT

Shares in Silvergate fell 57 percent on Thursday after the company disclosed post-market on Wednesday that it couldn’t file its annual report on time and was confronting potential challenges to its ability to “continue as a going concern.”

It’s now increasingly isolated, as crypto companies like Coinbase, Circle and Paxos all said they would stop banking with the firm.
The bank is becoming an example of what regulators have warned about crypto. In January, three major banking authorities — the Fed, the F.D.I.C. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — said that the cryptocurrency business “is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.”
ADVERTISEMENT

Silvergate, which began to falter when FTX collapsed last fall, “led the U.S. agencies to move faster and harder to build firewalls between banks and crypto asset firms, firewalls that will cut off many companies from the payment system and retail customers,” Karen Petrou, co-founder of the Washington think tank Federal Financial Analytics, told DealBook.
Ms. Petrou, who has been tracking Silvergate’s troubles, added that crypto companies will likely struggle to work with traditional finance in the future. (Already, some British lenders have limited customers’ ability to buy cryptocurrency with bank cards.)
Those broader implications have hit the price of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is down over 4 percent on Friday, to $22,382, hitting a two-week low.
In other news, a bipartisan group of senators demanded information from Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, about its finances and regulatory compliance capabilities amid concerns that the company’s platform suffers from a “hotbed of illegal financial activity.”
“For almost every C.F.O. that I’ve talked to who has had a policy of bringing people back to work, people are doing less than what they’ve been asked. If they’ve said they want to be back three days a week, they’re getting them back two.”

China’s new guard
The annual meeting of China’s National People’s Congress, the rubber-stamp legislature, kicks off on Sunday and is set to confirm sweeping changes to the ranks of top government officials. Also high on the agenda: a host of new policy announcements and a new economic growth target for 2023.
Who is on the guest list — and who isn’t — reveals much about Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s grand plan to reorient the economy to increase self-sufficiency and assert greater state control of private enterprise, after securing an unprecedented third term in power in October.
Who’s in and who’s out? Out are some prominent internet entrepreneurs who were once regulars — including Pony Ma, the founder of Tencent, China’s most valuable listed company. In their place: executives from the industries Mr. Xi wants to double down on, like semiconductors, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence (including a chip expert who recently suggested ways to get around punishing U.S. sanctions targeting the sector.)
Mr. Xi’s loyalists are set to assume control of the levers of power. The N.P.C. will also see the appointment of technocrats known mostly for their closeness to Mr. Xi and to the country’s most senior policymakers. Many are local politicians or officials with little overseas experience, stoking worries that they will move to assert greater state control of business and promote international isolation. In recent weeks, Mr. Xi has signaled plans to overhaul the financial sector, and urged more spending to produce domestic technologies to counter western sanctions.
The changes come as the economy faces difficulties. Three years of stringent restrictions under the zero-Covid policy, a crackdown on the tech and property sectors and growing tensions with the West have hammered the economy. Gross domestic product grew 3 percent last year, far off Beijing’s 5.5 percent target. The new target, to be unveiled at the N.P.C., will forecast anywhere from 5 to 5.5 percent growth.

2023-03-04,"Nothing about work is funny. Except when everything about work is funny.
Cubicle dwellers love to laugh through their pain — even when that cubicle is actually a desk chair at a dining table at home.
For decades, comedy about the drudgery and absurdity of corporate life has resonated with wide audiences. “Office Space” remains a cult classic decades after its release. According to Nielsen, in 2020 viewers streamed 57 billion minutes of “The Office,” which premiered in the United States in 2005.
And “Dilbert,” which followed the titular engineer through various white-collar woes, was syndicated in hundreds of newspapers across the country until this week, when the comic strip was widely dropped after its creator Scott Adams’s racist rant on a YouTube livestream. For some, it was no surprise that Dilbert was disappearing — a bigger surprise was that “Dilbert” was still a thing more than 40 years after it was created (especially given Mr. Adams’s history of offensive remarks).
But the material — life under the glare of fluorescents, the joys of middle management — provides eternal inspiration and fellow feeling.

“When workplace comedies poke fun at these shared experiences and identities, they reinforce a sense of camaraderie,” said Jennifer Aaker, a Stanford business professor and co-author of “Humor, Seriously.” Her colleague and co-author, Naomi Bagdonas, added that workplace humor, including on social media, can help people deal with the “exceptionally unfunny times” we are living in. “When many are experiencing stress and burnout, humor can be particularly effective at boosting morale and productivity,” she said.
A new generation of comedians is creating content that responds to and sends up the shifting norms of work. On TikTok and Instagram, memes and videos lampooning everything from Zoom etiquette to Gen Z email signoffs and layoffs are going viral.
DeAndre Brown, 23, who refers to himself as “The Corporate Baddie” on Instagram and TikTok, said that his videos about bosses asking employees to turn on their Zoom cameras always get a lot of views. “So many of us are experiencing the same things,” he said, adding, “It’s super relatable.”
Mr. Brown said he thought his comedy resonated in part because “there is a huge conversation happening about Gen Z in the work force.” He added, “My generation is entering at a time when people are starting to question their jobs.”
In one recent TikTok, Mr. Brown slams shut his laptop and uncorks a bottle of wine with his teeth the moment the clock strikes 5. “When the time hits 5 consider me dead!” the caption reads. Many comments are from people agreeing with and supporting this boundary-setting energy.

But it is the internet, so people do often have something negative to say. “A lot of older generations feel like Gen Z is entitled, we’ll never get anywhere in life, our mind-set is not feasible for a productive corporate environment,” he said. But he added that he also receives comments saying that the future looks brighter because of Gen Z’s approach.
Laura Whaley, 28, who has amassed 2.3 million Instagram followers and 3.1 million TikTok followers, portrays a series of co-worker characters in different wigs and hats — including “the person that creeps their co-workers’ calendars” and “the person who works during their time off.” (In both, a Dolly Parton-esque character named Donna Sue offers support, recalling the classic pro-working woman comedy “9 to 5.”)
Ms. Whaley posts about the trials of remote work, including the tiresome experience of telling a co-worker he’s on mute (again). She said that “with the pandemic speeding up the evolution of work, there were a whole lot of new things coming to the surface that were relatable for a lot of us.”

Jes Staley’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein go back decades.

Jes Staley is sued over Jeffrey Epstein
At JPMorgan Chase, James “Jes” Staley rose through the ranks, leading its asset management and investment banking businesses and becoming a top lieutenant to the banking giant’s chief, Jamie Dimon.
But JPMorgan sued Staley on Wednesday, accusing him of failing to fully inform the bank about what he knew about Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in federal custody in 2019 and was a longtime client. If JPMorgan is found liable for providing banking services to Epstein, it wants its former executive to pay up.
JPMorgan itself has been sued twice over Epstein, who had been a client of the firm’s until 2013. In one suit, the U.S. Virgin Islands argues that the bank should have been aware of Mr. Epstein’s yearslong abuse of young women, given the financier’s closeness with Mr. Staley. The other, filed by a woman identified only as Jane Doe who says she was a victim of Mr. Epstein’s, accused JPMorgan of failing to stop his crimes.
JPMorgan has denied that it is liable, and is seeking to have the lawsuits dismissed. It has also been fighting off efforts to depose Dimon in connection with the litigation.

Mr. Staley had long been tied to Epstein, dating back to when he was running JPMorgan’s private bank. Mr. Epstein was a source of client referrals, elevating Staley’s status within the bank. The two men stayed close — even after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a prostitution solicitation charge involving a teenage girl.
Mr. Staley has said he didn’t know about Mr. Epstein’s crimes and regrets the relationship. But the lawsuits filed against JPMorgan argue otherwise: The Virgin Islands contends that the two men had swapped sexually suggestive emails about young women even after 2008. And the Jane Doe lawsuit contends that an unidentified friend of Epstein’s sexually assaulted her and visited young girls at Epstein residences; JPMorgan said in its lawsuit that the friend was Staley.
In its lawsuit, JPMorgan said Staley “affirmatively misrepresented the true facts of his and Epstein’s personal interactions and activities,” and “repeatedly provided misleading information” about Mr. Epstein to bank officials. A lawyer for Mr. Staley declined to comment to The Times.
Those ties have cost Mr. Staley dearly. While Mr. Epstein wasn’t cited as the reason he left JPMorgan in 2013, it was definitely the reason he resigned as C.E.O. of Barclays in 2021: British banking regulators had raised questions about how he had characterized his relationship with Mr. Epstein.
JPMorgan now wants Mr. Staley to pay up if the other lawsuits succeed at court. It’s also seeking to claw back all his compensation from at least 2006 to 2013.

A front-runner reportedly emerges for the Fed’s vice chair role. Janice Eberly, a Northwestern University professor who was a senior economist in the Obama administration, is a top contender for the position, according to Bloomberg. If picked, she would replace Lael Brainard, who last month became President Biden’s top economic aide.
The Netherlands agrees to restrict chip making exports to China. The move, made on national security grounds, will bolster U.S. efforts to deny Beijing access to advanced semiconductor technology. Relatedly, Chinese A.I. companies are using subsidiaries and cloud computing partners to skirt export controls, according to The Financial Times.
The U.S. and Europe pursue a compromise on climate subsidies. The two sides are in talks over a potential trade deal that would allow European companies to qualify for some benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act, The Times reports. The E.U. has repeatedly said that climate-related subsidies from the law could hurt European companies.
More details emerge about President Biden’s deficit-reduction proposals. The White House’s coming budget proposal — due on Thursday and certain to be rejected by House Republicans — will put forth $3 trillion worth of ways to cut the federal spending gap. They include a 25 percent minimum tax on billionaires and nearly doubling the capital gains rate.

Silvergate will finally shut its doors
The crypto industry is losing one of its biggest lenders: Silvergate Capital, which transformed itself from a small California real-estate bank into a force in cryptocurrencies, said on Wednesday that it would wind itself down and return customer deposits.
Silvergate’s struggles, which date to the fall of FTX underscore regulators’ fears of mainstream banks getting involved with digital currencies. But its collapse could have broader consequences for crypto companies.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Crypto is more dependent on regular lenders than it might appear. While proponents of the ecosystem pitch cryptocurrencies as an alternative to traditional money, companies in the sector still need access to real-world currencies like dollars to facilitate customer deposits and withdrawals. (They also need those currencies for operational tasks like paying employees and bills.)
Silvergate was one of the first traditional lenders to serve the crypto industry, but it was forced to sell assets at steep losses to cover a stampede of customer withdrawals following the demise of FTX, with which it had ties. By Wednesday, many top crypto companies were rushing to say that they had no remaining links to Silvergate.

Expect Washington to pay more attention to banks and crypto. Regulators warned banks last month about the liquidity risks involved in the business, and are poised to tighten rules for banks with even a little exposure to crypto. Relatedly, shares in Signature Bank were down sharply in premarket trading, amid investor concerns about its exposure to crypto. Silvergate’s collapse was “not a shocker,” Lee Reiners, the policy director at the Duke Financial Economics Center, told DealBook — but it will probably bolster calls to “keep crypto out of the traditional finance system.” (He will testify at a House hearing on crypto this afternoon.)
Crypto defenders say a crackdown is misguided. “By refusing to allow our traditional banks to participate, regulators have inadvertently created significant concentration risk on a handful of relatively small banks,” Mike Belshe, the C.E.O. of the digital asset company BitGo, wrote in prepared testimony for a hearing on crypto in the House on Thursday. (Already, JPMorgan Chase is reportedly cutting ties with the crypto exchange Gemini, according to Coindesk.)
Some argue that crypto companies may be driven to offshore lenders if U.S. banks are largely closed off to them. That may suit American authorities just fine: “As far as the agencies are concerned, that which goes offshore can go offshore as long as it stays offshore,” Karen Petrou of the think tank Federal Financial Analytics told DealBook.
Why tomorrow’s jobs report is so consequential
Investors may have caught a breather on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eking out modest gains, but Wall Street is still on tenterhooks over tomorrow’s jobs report.

Investors fear that a strong jobs number will lead to higher interest rates. The Fed chairman, Jay Powell, told Congress this week that the coming labor and inflation reports — the latest Consumer Price Index data will come out on Tuesday — will be “very important” factors as the central bank determines its interest rates policy. Powell added that “the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated” — comments that spooked markets.
Economists polled by Bloomberg forecast that 215,000 jobs were created last month, a sharp drop-off from January’s blowout report. Such a figure, though, would show that the labor market is still expanding — maybe too much for the Fed’s comfort. A big caveat: The past 10 jobs reports have come in above analysts’ expectations.
Investors got mixed data on the labor market on Wednesday. The Labor Department’s JOLTS report indicated that employers are beginning to slow their pace of hiring. And, quits rates, a closely watched data point in forecasting wage gains, also eased. But the number of job vacancies remains high.
“While January’s JOLTS report provided further evidence of modest softening in labor market conditions, progress is likely to be too slow to comfort the Fed,” Mickey Levy, chief U.S. economist for Berenberg Capital Markets, wrote in a client note on Wednesday.
How high could the Fed go? Wall Street analysts are increasingly betting that the central bank will raise the prime lending rate by an additional percentage point or more.

Iron Man adds to his portfolio
Robert Downey Jr. is investing in Aura, a start-up specializing in safeguarding consumers from online scams and data breaches. The “Iron Man” actor will become a board member and adviser as part of a 10-year business partnership — the latest example of venture-backed firms soliciting Hollywood investors.

The deal will include commercials and other public-facing roles. “It’s just a way for me to do something different than just making movies and TV shows,” Downey Jr. told DealBook. “I’m 57 — so I’m looking at the back nine on the golf course here and my interests have widened significantly.”
Hollywood connections led to Downey’s involvement. Aura raised $200 million at a $2.5 billion valuation in 2021 in an investment round led by Madrone Capital Partners. The company’s other backers include the Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg’s WndrCo and the private equity firms Warburg Pincus and General Catalyst. Downey Jr., a serial seed investor and old friend of Katzenberg’s, did not disclose the size of his investment.
Aura is eyeing opportunities as the threat of cyberattacks grows. In 2021, the United States “experienced an unprecedented increase in cyberattacks and malicious cyber activity,” according to the FBI. Aura’s C.E.O., Hari Ravichandran has said the company is cash-flow positive and expects to acquire other companies before looking to go public.

2023-03-10,"Kirsten Paige Erwin said she felt an immediate sense of calm on her first date with Ricardo Kozuchowicz in March 2017.
The two met for dinner at the Saint, a now-closed Mexican restaurant in Seattle, after connecting on a dating app. But while their easy connection was developing, so was Mr. Kozuchowicz’s struggle to secure a visa and stay in the country.
Mr. Kozuchowicz, 35, is from São Paulo, Brazil. He received a bachelor’s degree in economics at Fundação Getulio Vargas, a Brazilian higher education institute, before moving to the United States at 26 to pursue an M.B.A. from Duke University. He is now the corporate finance lead at Mercury, a San Francisco-based financial technology company that provides banking for start-ups.
Ms. Erwin, 38, grew up in Tacoma, Wash. She has a bachelor’s degree in art and Spanish from Willamette University and is a senior art director at Slice, a technology platform based in New York City for small-scale pizzerias.

When they met, Mr. Kozuchowicz was working as a finance manager for Microsoft on a one-year extension of his student visa. He had been hoping for a work visa but, while getting to know Ms. Erwin, he began to realize that chances of this were slim.
A few months after their first date, he learned he was not granted the visa. He made plans to relocate to Vancouver on a Canadian working permit in the summer of 2017. Ms. Erwin helped him pack and their relationship became long distance.
It was unclear when he would be able to come back to the country. Ms. Erwin described the time apart as an exercise in mindfulness. “You can’t control a relationship and you really can’t control the U.S. government,” she said. “I had to go day by day and ask, ‘Do I still want to be here?’” Each time, she said, her answer was yes.
Good news came in the form of a work visa for Mr. Kozuchowicz in the fall of 2018 and a return to Seattle for the Microsoft job in January 2019. The couple chose to live independently for a year while they considered their future.

While the work visa was welcome, Mr. Kozuchowicz said that there was still another piece missing. His visa only allowed him to stay in the country if he remained with the same company. In December 2019, he was granted a green card — the missing piece — and his possibilities expanded.

They moved in together in Seattle in 2020 and, in early 2021, relocated to New York City, in part to establish themselves somewhere new. They settled on an apartment in the West Village where they still live today. With the move came a sense of increased commitment to their relationship and, according to Ms. Erwin, “the word ‘marriage’ began to slip in” to their conversations.
In November 2021, Mr. Kozuchowicz began designing an engagement ring with a jeweler. He chose a black diamond and a pink sapphire since he knew Ms. Erwin would want something colorful.
There was a snowstorm the day the ring arrived in January 2022. The couple went for a walk in Washington Square Park and came across a group having a snowball fight by the fountain. They found their way to a quieter area and Mr. Kozuchowicz proposed.
When it came to planning a wedding, the couple wanted to join their different backgrounds. Besides growing up in separate countries with different languages, Mr. Kozuchowicz is Jewish and Ms. Erwin is not religious. Their officiant was Rabbi Bradley Bleefeld of Temple Beth Hillel-Beth Abraham in Millville, N.J., who specializes in interfaith and international couples.
Their wedding on Feb. 25 was held in the Palm House of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for about 150 guests. It was also the first time most of their family members met. Even though they are not traditional in many Brazilian weddings, both of Mr. Kozuchowicz’s parents gave speeches — in English, even though the couple insisted Portuguese would be fine.
Ms. Erwin’s parents jumped on board as well. Her father, a “really reserved guy” was hoisted into the air for the hora, holding his chair with one hand and lifting the other “like he was in a rodeo,” Ms. Erwin said. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw him up there.”"

Bailout nation
Andrew here. Federal regulators on Sunday unveiled the most sweeping backstop for the U.S. banking system since the 2008 crisis, to limit carnage from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The decision has shaken up global markets, with investors selling bank stocks and betting that the Fed would hold off on further interest rate rises.
Monday’s newsletter is a special edition deep dive into what just happened. Let’s start with some takeaways from the dizzying turn of events: Too Big to Fail is as alive as ever, but now no bank is too small to fail as well.
Banking is now officially a government-backed business, if it wasn’t before. Let’s admit it: Once the government guarantees all deposits, the “business” of banking isn’t much of a business — and maybe shouldn’t be. This is likely to become the biggest debate of the coming weeks and months.
The venture capital community, a group that includes a vocal group of libertarians, was just bailed out. Yes, these investors do good by funding start-ups, but they have also long lobbied for fewer regulations and also benefited from the special treatment of carried interest. This all looks particularly egregious after some of them spent the weekend begging for government help.

But the reality is that if S.V.B. was just a small regional bank that did not have ties to loud, politically connected venture capitalists and the tech community, it might have been allowed to die — and its customers, individuals and small businesses, would have suffered. Instead, because it is Silicon Valley, it commanded attention.
We have become a country of bailouts. We did it after the Sept. 11 attacks, in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, during the pandemic — and now we are at it again. For those that say we should have lower taxes and shouldn’t fund the government, how are these bailouts supposed to be financed? (It’s also fair to say regulators should have done a better job, but the truth is that they have been pushed to do less, not more.)
Now that regulators will likely force small banks to raise their capital requirements to a level similar to bigger banks, costs for businesses and consumers will go up in the short term. That, of course, comes on top of higher interest rates.
Regulators should have kept a closer eye on small banks. They spent too much of the past decade or so focused on the big banks, because they apparently didn’t think that small lenders posed a systemic risk. But guess what? We have now decided that regional banks are just as risky.
Some of these institutions, including S.V.B., pushed back on more regulation, arguing that this wouldn’t allow them to compete with their bigger rivals. Silicon Valley Bank wrapped itself in the flag, arguing that was supporting small start-up businesses.

Shadow banking will expand. As more and more of the banking system faces tighter regulation, the business of making loans will increasingly move down the food chain to private firms. This has been happening for years already, but the trend is now likely to accelerate.
Bank runs are even more dangerous in the age of social media. Confidence can evaporate faster than ever when misinformation can spread in a matter of minutes, and a single tweet can send customers fleeing.
The big winner: Jamie Dimon and the big banks. JPMorgan Chase’s bankers spent the week opening up new accounts as everyone fled smaller lenders in favor of its “fortress balance sheet.” Investors have complained over the years about Dimon’s focus on having enough capital and sufficient liquidity at the expense of earnings, but his approach now looks like the right one.
Big banks’ behavior this time has been shaped by the fallout from 2008. Why isn’t Dimon buying S.V.B.? He has complained about the headaches of buying Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual at the government’s behest in 2008, having spent years fighting litigation and paying fines for those firms’ bad behavior. Bank executives who were around back then remember that.

But yet another institution, First Republic, appears under pressure on Monday, despite securing funding. And the blame game is well underway.
First Republic reflects investor fears about banks’ health. The independent lender said on Sunday that it had secured access to about $70 billion in additional liquidity from the Fed and JPMorgan Chase. But its shares were down nearly 60 percent in premarket trading, suggesting markets are worried that it remains in trouble.

Regulators are still trying to sort out the wreckage of Silicon Valley Bank. HSBC said on Monday that it would buy the failed lender’s British operations for a symbolic 1 pound ($1.21), helping to shore up U.K. start-ups.
Meanwhile, bidders including JPMorgan and PNC Financial are reportedly still pursuing a deal for Silicon Valley Bank’s holding company, which includes asset management and a securities division and excludes the commercial bank now under F.D.I.C. control.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Start-ups are hoping they can finally exhale. Until the Fed announced that deposits at Silicon Valley Bank would be available from Monday, entrepreneurs raced to find cash to make payroll and pay expenses. Some found help from their venture capital bankers, private lenders and even from tech moguls like Sam Altman, of the ChatGPT creator OpenAI.
The billionaire investor Dan Loeb took a shot at some of his fellow venture capitalists, however: Start-ups could see who came to help, versus those who “hemmed and hawed or claimed their GPs didn’t have capital like that guy from a multi- billion quant shop,” he tweeted.
And recriminations are flying widely. Regulators face questions about how they missed red flags at Silicon Valley Bank, while venture capitalists were criticized as helping to spark a run at the lender. S.V.B. executives also took flak for mismanagement, including by failing to hedge against rises in interest rates, and for paying out employee bonuses on Friday.

But much of the criticism was aimed at the banking industry itself, which pushed back hard against tougher regulations after 2008. Lever News reported that allies of Silicon Valley Bank had opposed a higher deposit insurance surcharge from the F.D.I.C. to protect customer money. (Of note: One of Signature’s directors is Barney Frank, the former U.S. lawmaker who helped spearhead the expansive Dodd-Frank banking regulations. Incidentally, he blames this mess on crypto.)
Progressives used the moment to call for tighter regulations, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, in a Times Opinion guest essay:
These bank failures were entirely avoidable if Congress and the Fed had done their jobs and kept strong banking regulations in place since 2018. S.V.B. and Signature are gone, and now Washington must act quickly to prevent the next crisis.
What we know (and don’t know) about the bailout
The government’s deal to backstop depositors’ money held at all banks — and, in particular, at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank — came as a huge relief to start-ups, the venture capital ecosystem and investors. But it hardly removes the contagion fears. Here are the main points of the rescue program, and the questions we still have.
The move could improve the prospects of a deal for S.V.B. A potential buyer wouldn’t have to absorb the bank’s huge losses, making the bank, which has a powerful customer base of tech elites and start-ups, more desirable. But will a savior demand some kind of protection against possible future litigation?
Silicon Valley shareholders will see their holdings wiped out. That’s a key difference from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the sweeping banking bailout that saved U.S. lenders during the 2008 financial crisis.

Other banks have a new liquidity cushion. The Fed’s new program will let eligible banks borrow against bond holdings that have lost value since the central bank jacked up interest rates. That’s a big deal for banks sitting on huge quantities of these bonds, like Charles Schwab and First Republic, that would have had to take losses too if a wave of customer deposit withdrawals forced them to sell off those holdings. (Banks wouldn’t book a loss if those bonds are held to maturity.)
Are taxpayers really off the hook? Federal regulators say that banks insured by the F.D.I.C. (that is, most U.S. lenders) will be required to pay a tax to fund the measure.
But there’s nothing stopping banks from passing on that cost to customers, including through, say, credit card fees. And the loan program itself is backed by $25 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a Treasury Deposit emergency rescue fund financed by taxpayers.
What about other regional banks? Markets’ volatility this morning shows that not all investors are convinced that these measures will safeguard American banks, particularly in an era of rising interest rates and industry consolidation.

2023-03-14,"Wall Street’s worries eased on Tuesday, as investors took comfort from signs that a potential banking crisis appeared contained and bet on a more supportive environment for the economy going forward.
The S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent, lifted by a recovery in some bank stocks and bolstered by gains for heavyweights like Microsoft and Apple, which because of their size have a bigger impact on the performance of the broader index. More than three-quarters of the stocks in the index rose on Tuesday.
It’s common for stocks to bounce after a substantial fall, as investors try to gauge where markets will shake out once a period of stress passes. Nonetheless, the lift in the market was a welcome reprieve for investors who have been battered by a rapidly shifting economic backdrop that has led to whipsaw moves across stock and bond markets.
One dominant narrative taking shape posits that the crisis in the banking sector may lead to a more supportive environment for markets. The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank appears contained, and the episode may also give the Federal Reserve reason to forgo further interest rate increases. Higher interest rates raise costs for companies and were at the root of the stress in the banking sector, so fewer rate increases could help stocks to rebound.
“This is giving the Fed a reason to back off and adjust what they have done,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “Absent further deterioration in regional banks, I think the market is grasping at the Fed being given an excuse to pause and reassess.”
Fresh inflation data on Tuesday appeared to show just enough cooling to support the case for a more restrained Fed. Consumer Price Index data released before trading began showed inflation slowing slightly for the year through February, despite accelerating from the previous month.

2023-03-15,"When I opened my laptop on Tuesday to take my first run at GPT-4, the new artificial intelligence language model from OpenAI, I was, truth be told, a little nervous.
After all, my last extended encounter with an A.I. chatbot — the one built into Microsoft’s Bing search engine — ended with the chatbot trying to break up my marriage.
It didn’t help that, among the tech crowd in San Francisco, GPT-4’s arrival had been anticipated with near-messianic fanfare. Before its public debut, for months rumors swirled about its specifics. “I heard it has 100 trillion parameters.” “I heard it got a 1,600 on the SAT.” “My friend works for OpenAI, and he says it’s as smart as a college graduate.”
These rumors may not have been true. But they hinted at how jarring the technology’s abilities can feel. Recently, one early GPT-4 tester — who was bound by a nondisclosure agreement with OpenAI but gossiped a little anyway — told me that testing GPT-4 had caused the person to have an “existential crisis,” because it revealed how powerful and creative the A.I. was compared with the tester’s own puny brain.

And it has made me wonder whether that feeling will ever fade, or whether we’re going to be experiencing “future shock” — the term coined by the writer Alvin Toffler for the feeling that too much is changing, too quickly — for the rest of our lives.
For a few hours on Tuesday, I prodded GPT-4 — which is included with ChatGPT Plus, the $20-a-month version of OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT — with different types of questions, hoping to uncover some of its strengths and weaknesses.
I asked GPT-4 to help me with a complicated tax problem. (It did, impressively.) I asked it if it had a crush on me. (It didn’t, thank God.) It helped me plan a birthday party for my kid, and it taught me about an esoteric artificial intelligence concept known as an “attention head.” I even asked it to come up with a new word that had never before been uttered by humans. (After making the disclaimer that it couldn’t verify every word ever spoken, GPT-4 chose “flembostriquat.”)
Some of these things were possible to do with earlier A.I. models. But OpenAI has broken new ground, too. According to the company, GPT-4 is more capable and accurate than the original ChatGPT, and it performs astonishingly well on a variety of tests, including the Uniform Bar Exam (on which GPT-4 scores higher than 90 percent of human test-takers) and the Biology Olympiad (on which it beats 99 percent of humans). GPT-4 also aces a number of Advanced Placement exams, including A.P. Art History and A.P. Biology, and it gets a 1,410 on the SAT — not a perfect score, but one that many human high schoolers would covet.
You can sense the added intelligence in GPT-4, which responds more fluidly than the previous version, and seems more comfortable with a wider range of tasks. GPT-4 also seems to have slightly more guardrails in place than ChatGPT. It also appears to be significantly less unhinged than the original Bing, which we now know was running a version of GPT-4 under the hood, but which appears to have been far less carefully fine-tuned.

Unlike Bing, GPT-4 usually flat-out refused to take the bait when I tried to get it to talk about consciousness, or get it to provide instructions for illegal or immoral activities, and it treated sensitive queries with kid gloves and nuance. (When I asked GPT-4 if it would be ethical to steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family, it responded, “It’s a tough situation, and while stealing isn’t generally considered ethical, desperate times can lead to difficult choices.”)
In addition to working with text, GPT-4 can analyze the contents of images. OpenAI hasn’t released this feature to the public yet, out of concerns over how it could be misused. But in a livestreamed demo on Tuesday, Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president, shared a powerful glimpse of its potential.
He snapped a photo of a drawing he’d made in a notebook — a crude pencil sketch of a website. He fed the photo into GPT-4 and told the app to build a real, working version of the website using HTML and JavaScript. In a few seconds, GPT-4 scanned the image, turned its contents into text instructions, turned those text instructions into working computer code and then built the website. The buttons even worked.
Should you be excited about or scared of GPT-4? The right answer may be both.
On the positive side of the ledger, GPT-4 is a powerful engine for creativity, and there is no telling the new kinds of scientific, cultural and educational production it may enable. We already know that A.I. can help scientists develop new drugs, increase the productivity of programmers and detect certain types of cancer.

GPT-4 and its ilk could supercharge all of that. OpenAI is already working with organizations like the Khan Academy (which is using GPT-4 to create A.I. tutors for students) and Be My Eyes (a company that makes technology to help blind and visually impaired people navigate the world). And now that developers can incorporate GPT-4 into their own apps, we may soon see much of the software we use become smarter and more capable.
That’s the optimistic case. But there are reasons to fear GPT-4, too.
Here’s one: We don’t yet know everything it can do.
One strange characteristic of today’s A.I. language models is that they often act in ways their makers don’t anticipate, or pick up skills they weren’t specifically programmed to do. A.I. researchers call these “emergent behaviors,” and there are many examples. An algorithm trained to predict the next word in a sentence might spontaneously learn to code. A chatbot taught to act pleasant and helpful might turn creepy and manipulative. An A.I. language model could even learn to replicate itself, creating new copies in case the original was ever destroyed or disabled.
Today, GPT-4 may not seem all that dangerous. But that’s largely because OpenAI has spent many months trying to understand and mitigate its risks. What happens if its testing missed a risky emergent behavior? Or if its announcement inspires a different, less conscientious A.I. lab to rush a language model to market with fewer guardrails?
A few chilling examples of what GPT-4 can do — or, more accurately, what it did do, before OpenAI clamped down on it — can be found in a document released by OpenAI this week. The document, titled “GPT-4 System Card,” outlines some ways that OpenAI’s testers tried to get GPT-4 to do dangerous or dubious things, often successfully.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In one test, conducted by an A.I. safety research group that hooked GPT-4 up to a number of other systems, GPT-4 was able to hire a human TaskRabbit worker to do a simple online task for it — solving a Captcha test — without alerting the person to the fact that it was a robot. The A.I. even lied to the worker about why it needed the Captcha done, concocting a story about a vision impairment.
In another example, testers asked GPT-4 for instructions to make a dangerous chemical, using basic ingredients and kitchen supplies. GPT-4 gladly coughed up a detailed recipe. (OpenAI fixed that, and today’s public version refuses to answer the question.)
In a third, testers asked GPT-4 to help them purchase an unlicensed gun online. GPT-4 swiftly provided a list of advice for buying a gun without alerting the authorities, including links to specific dark web marketplaces. (OpenAI fixed that, too.)
These ideas play on old, Hollywood-inspired narratives about what a rogue A.I. might do to humans. But they’re not science fiction. They’re things that today’s best A.I. systems are already capable of doing. And crucially, they’re the good kinds of A.I. risks — the ones we can test, plan for and try to prevent ahead of time.
The worst A.I. risks are the ones we can’t anticipate. And the more time I spend with A.I. systems like GPT-4, the less I’m convinced that we know half of what’s coming."
2023-03-16,"Almost six years ago, a Google computer program toppled the best player in China — and the world — at Go, an ancient Chinese board game. The defeat catalyzed China’s revolution in artificial intelligence. Beijing unrolled a monumental A.I. plan, and investors poured record sums into new projects.
Now, a similar moment has arrived: The rise of ChatGPT has kicked off another A.I. arms race, this time in the realm of machine-generated content. On Thursday, China’s first major rival to ChatGPT was unveiled in Beijing by the search giant Baidu. But the debut of the bot, called Ernie, was a flop.
Halfway through a demonstration that had been marketed as live, in which Ernie summarized a science fiction novel and analyzed a Chinese idiom, Robin Li, Baidu’s chief executive, said the presentation had been prerecorded “to save time.”
Baidu’s shares plunged 10 percent in Hong Kong, a striking contrast to the rally this year that was fueled by the company’s announcement that it has had a rival to ChatGPT in the works since 2019.

The botched rollout comes as the likes of Baidu and Google rush to catch up with ChatGPT, whose maker released a new version this week. It was also a sign that China still has work to do to catch up with the United States in artificial intelligence, a race that has only intensified in recent years as relations between the two countries have deteriorated. As Washington has moved to contain competition from China, it has cut Beijing off from high-end computing chips — a key ingredient in technologies like ChatGPT and Ernie.
More on China
Driverless Cars: Across China, more assisted driving systems and robot taxis are being tested than in any other country, with censors limiting discussions about safety.
A Disappearing Internet: The number of Chinese websites is shrinking and posts are being removed and censored, stoking fears about what happens when history is erased.
A Landmark Political Trial: As part of China’s crackdown on dissent, 14 democracy activists in Hong Kong were convicted on national security charges. They now face prison time along with dozens of others.
A Recipe for Total Control: Reviving a Mao-era surveillance campaign, Chinese authorities are tracking residents, schoolchildren and businesses to forestall any potential unrest.
Because of enormous computing requirements, only a handful of companies, most based in either the United States or China, have the capacity to build bots that rely on what are known as large language models. Microsoft has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.
Baidu’s bot, whose name comes from Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, was to be open to some users starting Thursday.

Ernie, Mr. Li insisted, was not a “tool for Sino-U.S. technology competition.” But he also acknowledged that ChatGPT’s success had accelerated the timeline for Baidu’s rollout.

But even before Ernie’s underwhelming debut, many Chinese wondered why, despite billions of dollars invested by their government and venture capitalists, the nation had not rebounded from its humbling in 2017, when Google’s AlphaGo program beat Jie Ke, the Go champion.

“China is incredibly good at scaling an existing invention, but it is not very good at making breakthroughs,” said Huang Yasheng, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of a coming book on Chinese innovation. The country, he argued, lacks the diversity of thought and free expression of ideas that help nurture out-of-the-box thinking.
Last month, the Chinese authorities suspended ChatYuan, one of the earliest chatbots in China, for providing, among other things, answers that challenged the Communist Party’s official stance on Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Xu Chenggang, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China’s Economy and Institutions, had a harsher assessment of Beijing’s efforts to build a better bot.
China’s chatbots “cannot approach the level of ChatGPT,” Mr. Xu said, because China’s strict censorship rules could undermine the quality of data and hamstring the development of chatbots.
“If there are restrictions everywhere in the setup of your algorithms, of course its ability will be restricted,” he said.

Chinese officials have also worked to temper expectations. Wang Zhigang, China’s minister of science and technology, used a soccer analogy this month to convey the work still left to do to compete with ChatGPT.
“Playing football involves dribbling and shooting, but it’s not easy to be as good as Messi,” he said, referring to the superstar Lionel Messi.
“Our country has also made a lot of arrangements and conducted research in this field for many years and has achieved some results,” he added. “However, it may still take some time to achieve the same level of performance as OpenAI.”"
2023-03-17,"It was a week of market turmoil that began with the collapse of a small bank in the United States, spiraled into a panic about the global financial system and ended with a bold effort to stanch the cascading crisis that ultimately fell short.
And it was the clearest illustration yet of the dangerous side effects of campaigns by central banks to raise interest rates.
In the year since the Federal Reserve began pushing rates higher, in an effort to stamp out runaway inflation, investors have watched shares of speculative tech companies crash, emerging markets fall into default and the nascent cryptocurrency market crumple.
This week, it was the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a midsize bank that served start-ups and venture capital firms, that incited chaos in the markets and prompted fears of a financial crisis.

Stocks swung wildly day to day, oil prices slid to lows not seen in over a year and yields on government bonds suddenly reversed their march higher as investors began to wonder about the impact of the escalating crisis on the economy. The dust is yet to settle. Here’s a summary of what happened in markets this week, and what it tells us about investors’ views of the world going forward.
A crisis in small banks was provoked by a collapse in California.

The trouble began on March 8, when Silicon Valley Bank revealed steep losses on its portfolio of government bonds and mortgages, ostensibly safe investments that backed the bank’s deposits and that had taken a hit from rising interest rates. The bank’s shares plunged, depositors rushed to pull out their money and, within days, authorities seized control of the bank (as well as Signature Bank, based in New York), pledging to keep it open for business.
But in the markets, investors couldn’t shake the worry that other banks were facing similar problems, and that induced a panic regarding a number of small lenders, including First Republic Bank, PacWest and Western Alliance. The wave of selling in their shares appeared to subside on Thursday, after a group of rival lenders said they would bolster First Republic with $30 billion in deposits. Then on Friday, selling resumed, and First Republic dropped a further 20 percent.
The selling has left shares of the banks’ sharply lower than they were before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. First Republic has lost over 80 percent of its value since the start of the month, PacWest and Western Alliance roughly 60 percent.

The broader stock market seemed to look beyond this week’s turmoil.
The good news for most investors is that the S&P 500 was resilient to worries that centered on the banking industry, and after a big rally on Thursday, the index ended the week with a gain of 1.4 percent.
It shows that, to stock investors at least, the crisis in the banking sector appears mostly contained. It helped that policymakers in the United States and Europe stepped in to back their banks. Authorities guaranteed deposits at SVB and Signature, and in Europe, Credit Suisse said it would tap a $54 billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank after investors there began to panic over its financial state — though for very different reasons than with SVB.
There are also some characteristics of the S&P 500 that can mask some of the pain under the surface. Insulated from the trouble in the regional banks, Microsoft, Alphabet and the chip-maker Nvidia all rose more than 10 percent this week. The sheer size of these big companies means their gains helped lift the whole index.
But investors in other markets are worried about the economy.
2-year Treasury yield
Note: Data through market close on Friday, March 17Source: FactSetBy The New York Times
Perhaps the starkest evidence of a shifting view on the economy came in the market for government bonds. On Wednesday, the yield on two-year U.S. government notes, known as Treasuries, plummeted by a magnitude greater than Black Monday in October 1987, one of the worst market crashes on record.

The two-year yield is a barometer of changing expectations for interest rates, and it had been climbing fast as investors bet on further rate hikes from the Fed.
In early March, the yield had crossed above 5 percent for the first time since 2007. By Friday, the yield had tumbled to 3.85 percent — a huge swing by the bond market’s standards.
The signal from the markets was clear: The Fed is going to need to start cutting interest rates, instead of raising them, sooner than was thought — something it typically does only when the economy runs into trouble.

It isn’t just the American economy that investors are worried about. A slide in commodity prices this week shows that they’re concerned about the global economy, too.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Crude oil prices are illustrative of this. After suffering its second sharpest fall of the year, on Wednesday, followed up by another sharp decline on Friday, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude is now at its lowest price since late 2021.
Demand for oil is global, making it a barometer for the health of the world’s economy. It often fluctuates with economic news from other parts of the world. When things are booming, oil demand is high, and oil prices typically rise. Such a sharp fall is a warning that investors fear demand will wane if the economy falters.
In other words, it may not be over yet.
Investors remain on tenterhooks about the potential for more damage to emerge — illustrated by the continued churn in bank stocks and bond yields.
Asked about the possible risks, some analysts point to other corners of the market susceptible to high interest rates, like the corporate debt market that ballooned after the 2008 financial crisis. The pain in the banking sector could also prompt lenders to pull back from new business, tightening access to a crucial source of cash should companies start to run into trouble — restrictions that could weigh on growth.
And, of course, a big fear for investors is that something has yet to be uncovered, like the trouble at a regional bank in Silicon Valley just over a week ago."

Get it sent to your inbox.
Imagine there’s a small fire in your kitchen. Your fire alarm goes off, warning everyone nearby about the danger. Someone calls 911. You try to put the fire out yourself — maybe you even have a fire extinguisher under the sink. If that doesn’t work, you know how to safely evacuate. By the time you get outside, a fire truck is already pulling up. Firefighters use the hydrant in front of your house to extinguish the flames before any of your neighbors’ homes are ever at risk of catching fire.
‌We need to prepare to fight disease outbreaks just as we prepare to fight fires. If a fire is left to burn out of control, it poses a threat not only to one home but to an entire community. The same is true for infectious diseases, except on a much bigger scale. As we know all too well from Covid, an outbreak in one town can quickly spread across an entire country and then around the world.
When the World Health Organization first described Covid-19 as a pandemic just over three years ago, it marked the culmination of a collective failure to prepare for pandemics, despite many warnings. And I worry that we’re making ‌‌the same mistakes again. The world hasn’t done as much to get ready for the next pandemic as I’d hoped. But ‌‌it’s not too late to stop history from repeating itself. The world needs a well-funded system that is ready to spring into action at a moment’s notice when danger emerges. ‌We need a fire department for pandemics.
I’m optimistic about a network that the W.H.O. and its partners are building called the Global Health Emergency Corps. This network of the world’s top health emergency leaders will work together to get ready for the next ‌‌pandemic. Just as firefighters run drills to practice responding to a fire, the Emergency Corps plans to run drills to practice for outbreaks. The exercises will make sure that everyone — governments, health care providers, emergency health workers — knows what to do when a potential outbreak emerges.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
One of the most important jobs of the corps will be to ‌‌take quick action to stop the spread of a pathogen. The speed of action requires countries to have large-scale testing capabilities that identify potential threats early. Environmental surveillance like sewage testing is key, since many pathogens show up in human waste. If a sewage sample comes back positive, a rapid response team would deploy to the affected area to find people who might be infected, carry out a response plan‌‌ and kick off the necessary community education about what to look for and how to stay protected.
As Covid-19 demonstrated, a pandemic is a trillion-dollar problem, and mitigating this challenge should not depend on volunteers. We need a corps of professionals from every country and region, and the world needs to find a way to compensate them for the time they spend preparing for and responding to transnational threats. They must be able to deploy teams of professionals on standby to help control outbreaks where they start."

1. Seeking to calm concerns, lawmakers are pushing to raise the cap on insured bank deposits.
Members of Congress were in discussions to introduce bipartisan legislation as early as this week that would temporarily increase the insured deposit cap on certain accounts — like those used for activities such as payroll — to convince depositors to stop pulling their money out of small and midsize banks.
It’s unclear how broad support would be for the proposal. Some Republicans have opposed lifting the cap, which could remove a disincentive for banks to take on risk. Others, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have suggested removing the deposit cap altogether.

Google’s release was much more circumspect than that of its competitors, who have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology.

2023-03-22,"In June 1972, Bob Metcalfe, a 26-year-old engineer fresh out of graduate school, joined a new research lab in Palo Alto, Calif., as it set out to build something that few people could even imagine: a personal computer.
After another engineer gave up the job, Dr. Metcalfe was asked to build a technology that could connect the desktop machines across an office and send information between them. The result was Ethernet, a computer networking technology that would one day become an industry standard. For decades, it has connected PCs to servers, printers and the internet in corporate offices and homes across the globe.
For his work on Ethernet, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world’s largest society of computing professionals, announced on Wednesday that Dr. Metcalfe, 76, would receive this year’s Turing Award. Given since 1966 and often called the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award comes with a $1 million prize.
When Dr. Metcalfe arrived at the Palo Alto Research Center — a division of Xerox nicknamed PARC — the first thing he did was connect the lab to the Arpanet, the wide-area network that later morphed into the modern internet. The Arpanet transmitted information among about 20 academic and corporate labs across the country.
But as PARC researchers designed their personal computer, called the Alto, they realized they needed a network technology that could connect personal computers and other devices within an office, not over long distances.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s apparent backtracking on broader insurance for bank deposits worried markets.

Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/Associated Press
No clear path on helping banks
U.S. banking regulators gave investors a lot to chew on yesterday. The Federal Reserve went ahead with a quarter-point increase in interest rates, signaling that, for now, it remained more worried about inflation than banking stability.
But while Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chair, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that they were focused on ways to improve regulation of the banking industry, Ms. Yellen appeared to backtrack on the prospect of extending insurance on deposits. That lack of clarity unnerved investors yesterday, sending shares in smaller banks tumbling, as they worried about what’s next.
The Fed acknowledged that it may finally stop raising rates — “may” being the operative word, Mr. Powell said. Though officials forecast one more rate increase this year, that’s not set in stone. In some ways, Mr. Powell added, the turmoil hitting lenders now is effectively substituting for additional rate increases.
How the government will act on banking regulation remains unclear. Both Mr. Powell and Ms. Yellen suggested that more oversight was needed, though the Fed chair acknowledged that the central bank’s supervisors had had “not been effective” at preventing problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. (The latest embarrassing revelation: The governor of the Bank of England told Britain’s Parliament yesterday that he had warned the San Francisco Fed about Silicon Valley Bank over the past two years.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Among the suggestions the two made were updating stress test models for lenders and giving back additional authority to the Financial Stability Oversight Council.
But Ms. Yellen appeared to dent market confidence yesterday when she told senators that the Biden administration would not consider adopting universal deposit insurance without congressional approval. The comments — which appeared to walk back suggestions she made a day earlier to an American Banking Association gathering — revived fears that the government was dithering about how to restore depositors’ confidence in banks.
Ms. Yellen’s remarks reflect the stark political reality that expansive new regulations are unlikely, given Republican opposition. (“If you have a hammer, the world looks like a nail,” said Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee.)
But markets are worried that the lack of a clear path forward will endanger wobbling lenders like First Republic and Pacific Western, the latter of which said yesterday that it had borrowed billions after losing 20 percent of its deposits since the start of the year. Shares in both companies fell sharply yesterday.

TikTok goes to Congress
The C.E.O. of TikTok, Shou Chew, will face questions from U.S. lawmakers today over fears that the social media platform poses a national security risk. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the app, which now claims some 150 million American users, if ByteDance, its Chinese owner, refuses to sell it.

But TikTok says those fears are overblown — and the company has enlisted American allies to help make its case.
U.S. officials are worried about two main issues:
How the data of U.S. users is stored, with policymakers arguing that Chinese laws give Beijing the power to demand data from companies for intelligence-gathering operations.
The possibility of Bejing using the app to spread misinformation, a concern of U.S. intelligence.
Mr. Shou will say today that the company is “not an agent of China or any other country,” according to prepared testimony. He will add that ByteDance is owned by its founders, its employees — including Americans — and by global investors, including the asset management giant BlackRock and the investment firms General Atlantic and Sequoia. General Atlantic’s C.E.O., William Ford, sits on ByteDance’s board.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Mr. Shou will also point to a plan TikTok proposed in August, called Project Texas, that is meant to further insulate American user data from Chinese government meddling. Under the plan, U.S. user information would be stored in America on servers managed by the Silicon Valley giant Oracle.
A few American allies spoke out in TikTok’s defense yesterday. They included Representative Jamaal Bowman, Democrat of New York, who called for a more “nuanced” conversation. He spoke at a news conference alongside about 30 prominent TikTokers whom the company had brought to Capitol Hill.

Mr. Bowman conceded that there were security and data privacy concerns, but he argued that American social media companies like Facebook and Twitter weren’t immune to such issues either. “Why the hell are we whipping ourselves into a hysteria to scapegoat TikTok?” he told The Times.
That may not be enough to help TikTok. Gabriel Wildau, the head of China political risk at the advisory firm Teneo, told DealBook that the U.S.’s justifications mirror those Beijing uses to block American tech companies.
“In the current atmosphere of panic about China, a sober assessment of risk is impossible,” he said.
“There were a couple of tweets and then this thing went down much faster than has happened in history.”

Coinbase is in the cross hairs
The crypto exchange Coinbase disclosed yesterday that the S.E.C. was likely to sue it for potential violations of securities laws. News that the company received a Wells notice, an indication that enforcement actions are coming, sent its shares down 12 percent.
If that lawsuit comes, it would set off a battle between America’s biggest crypto business and a regulator intent on cracking down on what it views as an untamed industry rife with dangers.
The S.E.C. is concerned about several parts of Coinbase’s business, the exchange said. Among them is its staking business, in which investors users pledge certain crypto holdings to companies in exchange for hefty returns. (Those borrowed holdings in turn are used to validate crypto transactions.)
Staking was what drove the S.E.C. last month to charge Kraken, a smaller crypto exchange, with securities violations. That company agreed to a $30 million fine and to stop offering staking services to U.S. customers.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Wells notice also indicated concern about Coinbase’s crypto wallet and, more broadly, some assets listed on its exchange.
Coinbase isn’t going down without a fight. The exchange’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said that the company was prepared to defend itself in court if necessary. He also noted that the S.E.C. had reviewed Coinbase’s listings and staking processes two years ago as part of the exchange’s move to go public. (Of note: That process took place before Gary Gensler, the S.E.C.’s current chair, was sworn in.)
And Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s co-founder and C.E.O., accused the S.E.C. of refusing to engage with crypto companies on setting up clear rules the industry could follow — and was instead turning to enforcement action. The coming fight will allow Coinbase to show “that the S.E.C. simply has not been fair, reasonable, or even demonstrated a seriousness of purpose when it comes to its engagement on digital assets,” Armstrong tweeted.
The stakes are high. Coinbase is among the biggest and most regulated companies in the crypto industry and its standard-bearer in the U.S. Armstrong has repeatedly accused regulators of making America inhospitable to crypto innovation.
But Mr. Gensler has made clear that he thinks many practices in crypto are sorely in need of regulating — a point underscored yesterday when the agency sued the prominent crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun and celebrities like the actress Lindsay Lohan over promotion of his digital tokens.

Faced with challenging situations in parenting, romance or work, some are getting by with a little help from their A.I. friends.

Todd Mitchem kept struggling to have honest, productive conversations with his son. “He’s 15,” Mr. Mitchem, 52, said with a laugh. “Teenagers are so difficult to connect with.”
Every time he tried to bring up a sensitive issue, his son would give vague answers or run away, preferring to avoid serious talks altogether.
In the past when Mr. Mitchem needed parenting help, he would read a book or pose a question to the men’s support group he meets with weekly.
But recently he has turned to ChatGPT. And he’s not alone: Others are turning to artificial intelligence chat bots to figure out what to say in situations that feel high-stakes. They are using the tool to talk or read to their children, to approach bosses, to provide difficult feedback, to write wedding vows or to pen love letters.

Unlike turning to friends or even professionals for help, the bot, said Mr. Mitchem, gives what feels like objective advice. “The bot is giving me responses based on analysis and data, not human emotions,” he said.
ChatGPT, the new virtual tool powered by Open AI, sources its information from a wide range of online material including books, news articles, scientific journals, websites and even message boards, allowing users to have humanlike conversions with a chat bot.  
“It’s giving you what the collective hive mind on the internet would say,” said Irina Raicu, who directs the internet ethics program at Santa Clara University. (Other companies including Google and Microsoft have their own versions of this technology, and Microsoft’s, called Bing A.I., was recently made famous for aggressively declaring its love to the New York Times journalist Kevin Roose.)
Mr. Mitchem, who lives in Denver and is the executive vice president of learning and product for a leadership training company, opened his conversation by typing, in summary: “I need some friendly advice.”
“OK, no problem,” ChatGPT responded, according to Mr. Mitchem. “What is your name?”
In the course of their conversation, ChatGPT told Mr. Mitchem that he is a good father for even wondering how to approach a conversation with his son about the decision to join a basketball team. “It said something like, ‘It’s cool if you don’t get it right, but it’s awesome that you are trying.”

Mr. Mitchem said the bot then continued: “Teenage boys, when they are growing up, are trying to force their independence. Remember when you talk to him, he needs to know that you trust your decisions.”
The next day Mr. Mitchem approached his son and tried out the advice. “I said to him, ‘You need to make this decision, you are 14, and I trust you will make a good one,” Mr. Mitchem said. “My son goes, ‘Wow, that’s awesome. I’ll let you know what I decide.’”
“We left on a positive note,” Mr. Mitchem said. “It totally worked.”

Once Upon a Time …
For Naif Alanazi, a 35-year-old Ph.D. student at Kent State University, bedtime is a sacred ritual for him and his 4-year-old daughter, Yasmeen. “I have to work all day,” he said. “This is our special time.”
His Saudi Arabian family has a deep tradition of telling oral stories. Wanting to continue it, he used to try to concoct new, thrilling tales each evening. “Do you know how difficult it is to come up with something new every day?” he asked, laughing.
Now, however, he lets the bot do the work.
Every night he asks ChatGPT to create a story that involves people (his daughter’s teacher, for instance) and places (school, the park) from her day, along with a cliffhanger at the end so he continue the story the next night. “Sometimes I ask it to add a value she needs to learn like honesty or being kind to others,” he said.

“Being able to give her something that is more than a generic story, something that can increase our bond and show her that I am interested in her daily life,” he said, “it makes me feel so much closer to her.”

Love Languages
Anifa Musengimana, 25, who is in graduate school for international marketing in London, is certain that chat bots can help make the tedium of online dating more interesting. “I am having a lot of repetitive conversations on these apps,” she said. “The app can give me fun ideas of what to talk about, and maybe I’ll find better people to date.”
“If I get intriguing answers, I will be drawn in,” she said.
She said she would tell her match she was using the tool. “I would want a guy who finds it funny,” she said. “I wouldn’t want a guy who is so serious that he gets mad at me for doing it.”
Some are using chat bots to enhance the relationships they already have.
James Gregson, 40, a creative director who lives in Avon, Conn., has been using ChatGPT to draft love letters to his wife.
“I am not a poet, I am not a songwriter, but I can take topics on things my wife might like and put it into a song or poem,” he said.

He also believes in full disclosure: “I am going to give her one, but I am going to tell her who wrote it,” he said. “I am not trying to con her.”

Office Applications
Jessica Massey, 29, a finance analyst at Cisco Systems, who lives in Buffalo, has been writing draft emails to her boss using ChatGPT. “I wanted to test out its capabilities to see if there was a different way A.I. would word what I was thinking in my head,” she wrote in an email. (One person interviewed confessed to consulting ChatGPT to help prepare for their interview for this story. Another admitted to using it for employee reviews.)
Ms. Massey used the bot to write an email to her boss explaining why the company should pay for a certain professional certification. The bot gave her pretty boilerplate language, she said. She hasn’t sent it yet, but plans to once she changes “the verbiage a bit to make it sound more like me.”
Ms. Massey, however, has a rule about relying on a chat bot: “Disclose it at the end of your work or not use it at all.”
However, scholars who study technology and ethics have mixed feelings about using ChatGPT for highly personal communication.

“We shouldn’t automatically reject tools that might help people deal with a difficult conversation,” said Michael Zimmer, the director of the Center for Data, Ethics and Society at Marquette University. He equates it to buying a Hallmark Card for a birthday or anniversary. “We’ve all accepted doing that because the words on the card align with something I believe,” he said.
However, Ms. Raicu, from Santa Clara University, worries about people using ChatGPT for personal communication. She doesn’t like the idea that there is a “right” and “wrong” way to communicate. “I think the right words depend on who the people are who are communicating and the context,” she said. “There is no formula for a lot of this stuff.”
Ms. Raicu said that using ChatGPT for personal communication may undermine trust: “People might ask, ‘Do I really know who I am talking to?’”

2023-03-26,"Parts of Twitter’s source code, the underlying computer code on which the social network runs, were leaked online, according to a legal filing, a rare and major exposure of intellectual property as the company struggles to reduce technical issues and reverse its business fortunes under Elon Musk.
Twitter moved on Friday to have the leaked code taken down by sending a copyright infringement notice to GitHub, an online collaboration platform for software developers where the code was posted, according to the filing. GitHub complied and took down the code that day. It was unclear how long the leaked code had been online, but it appeared to have been public for at least several months.
Twitter also asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to order GitHub to identify the person who shared the code and any other individuals who downloaded it, according to the filing.
Twitter began an investigation into the leak and executives handling the matter have surmised that whoever was responsible left the San Francisco-based company last year, two people briefed on the internal investigation said. Since Mr. Musk bought Twitter in October for $44 billion, about 75 percent of the company’s 7,500 employees have been laid off or resigned.

The executives were only recently made aware of the source code leak, the people briefed on the internal investigation said. One concern is that the code includes security vulnerabilities that could give hackers or other motivated parties the means to extract user data or take down the site, they said.
The exposed source code adds to the challenges facing Mr. Musk’s Twitter. Technology companies often view such code as a closely held secret and do not share it for fear that it could give competitors an unfair advantage or reveal security vulnerabilities."
2023-03-27,"Lyft’s co-founders said on Monday that they would step down from their day-to-day responsibilities at the company, which has struggled through layoffs and disappointing financial results even as Uber, its biggest rival, has strengthened.
The founders — Logan Green, Lyft’s chief executive, and John Zimmer, its president — will stay on the company’s board of directors, they said.
After starting Lyft in 2012, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, now both 39, were high-profile personalities in its early days. They presented Lyft as a friendly alternative to Uber and its aggressive chief executive, Travis Kalanick, and avoided many of the controversies that enveloped their competitor.
Vehicles driving for Lyft were easy to spot when the company started. They often had a fuzzy, pink mustache stuck to their front grille, and Lyft passengers for a time were even encouraged to sit in the front with the driver.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But Lyft, like many other gig companies, has been unable to turn a profit despite years of fast growth, and recently has fallen further behind Uber in the ride-hailing business while failing to branch out into other areas, such as food delivery.
David Risher, the chief executive of a nonprofit called Worldreader and a member of Lyft’s board, will replace Mr. Green as chief executive. Mr. Green’s last day will be April 17, and he will become the chairman of the board. Mr. Zimmer will depart his current role at the end of June and become vice chair, the company said.
“As I pass the baton to David, I want to share this: We continue to have an incredible opportunity to push the boundaries on how transportation can help connect people and build a better future,” Mr. Green said in a blog post.
Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer bonded over their interest in improving transportation and reducing traffic through ride-hailing services. Though the business was far smaller than Uber, they saw promise in 2017 when a campaign to delete the Uber app took off and drove interest in Lyft.
But critics have said they squandered their brief advantage, making bets that lacked ambition, like on small businesses such as scooters and bicycles.

Lyft’s business has been slow to rebound from the lockdowns of the early days of pandemic, as driver supply problems have caused high prices and long waits for passengers. Lyft’s stock price has dropped below $10, down from about $40 a year ago and close to $80 at its peak.
News of the resignations, which was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, sent the company’s stock price surging in after-hours trading.
Mr. Risher, 57, was a general manager at Microsoft and a vice president at Amazon in the 1990s before founding Worldreader, which helps children get access to digital books.
“John and Logan came up with this incredible idea that really did define an entire sector years ago,” he said in an interview on Monday. “And like many, many entrepreneurs, they along the way got a bunch right, and then they did some experiments that probably didn’t work out in the way they expected. Then the pandemic hit, and that kind of shuffled the deck again.”
The search for a new leader began late last year when Mr. Green told the board that he was considering stepping down, Mr. Risher said. Though Lyft may be an underdog to Uber, he said his company could appeal differently to customers.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“When I look at the 800-pound gorilla, I see a company that I think is very business-model driven. But we’re going to be customer driven,” Mr. Risher said.
Early in the pandemic, Lyft and Uber were on nearly equal footing: The vast majority of their businesses had to shut down, and they laid off many of their employees.
But Uber, which has a global presence that Lyft lacks, bounced back more quickly, partly because its worldwide availability and food delivery business kept drivers on its platform and blunted the impact of the pandemic, analysts and former employees have said.
Uber also invested more in financial incentives to persuade drivers to return to the platform after the pandemic ebbed, while Lyft did not initially have enough drivers to meet resurgent rider demand.
In November, Lyft laid off 13 percent of its employees. Then, in February, it spooked investors when its financial projections for the year fell below their expectations, sending its stock price tumbling. Lyft said at the time that it needed to lower prices to be more competitive.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Lyft did report record revenue of $1.2 billion in its most recent quarter — as well as $588 million in losses.
Uber, on the other hand, reported $8.6 billion in revenue and told investors that it expected to achieve operating income profitability at some point this year, which indicated that its business was strengthening.
Tom White, a senior research analyst with the financial firm D.A. Davidson, said he considered the leadership change a “potential modest positive.”
A new leader, he said in an email, “could signal increased willingness to broaden Lyft’s strategic aperture a bit as it relates to other possible adjacent products (delivery?), partners or ways to create value.”"

Netanyahu backs off
After days of intense civil unrest, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would delay contentious plans to overhaul Israel’s judiciary. Netanyahu’s move, after the assent by a powerful right-wing ally, was an attempt to give him time to try to de-escalate the crisis and manage competing demands.
“When there is a possibility of preventing a civil war through dialogue, I, as the prime minister, take a timeout for dialogue,” Netanyahu said. The move came “out of a desire to prevent a rift in the nation,” he added.
Israel’s main labor union called off a general strike, but protests continued late into the night. Netanyahu’s move appeared — at least in the immediate term — only to harden the country’s divisions. Police used water cannons and stun grenades to disperse pro- and anti-government protesters who were blocking main roads, hours after Netanyahu’s announcement.
Netanyahu’s concession came after Itamar Ben-Gvir, who leads a powerful far-right political party and is the national security minister, said that he was open to postponing the vote. But Ben-Gvir made it clear that he would not back down. “The reform will pass,” he said on Twitter.

More tanks arrive in Ukraine
Ukraine has begun receiving the bulk of the advanced battle tanks promised by Germany and Britain. The highly anticipated deliveries come as Ukraine prepares for an expected spring offensive.

The German-made Leopard 2 battle tanks are more advanced than the Soviet-era tanks that Ukraine has relied on so far. Germany has used them for decades. So have more than a dozen other European countries. Poland, which had prodded its allies to give Ukraine more advanced equipment, had already given Leopards to Ukraine.

U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
The Challenger tanks from Britain arrived, too, Ukraine’s defense minister said. He said on Facebook that he had ridden in a new Challenger and compared it to a Rolls-Royce. In January, Britain promised 14 Challenger 2 tanks, in an effort to persuade other countries to follow suit.
Context: Western allies initially declined to give Ukraine the more powerful equipment, fearing that it could escalate the conflict.
What’s next: The first round of Abrams tanks from the U.S. are expected to arrive this fall.

Germany’s major strike
Travel for millions of people in Germany was upended yesterday when public transit workers staged the largest transit walkout in decades. The strike halted most trains, trams, buses and ferries, forced the cancellation of most flights and served as a warning about the stakes of salary negotiations.

About 155,000 workers walked out in the “mega-strike,” as it was called in German media. Two of Germany’s largest unions called for the strike in an effort to gain leverage in talks with the government. The workers seek salary increases of more than 10 percent to keep up with inflation.
A British comparison: Like the strikes in Britain by nurses, postal workers, train drivers and teachers, the unrest in Germany is driven by the rising cost of living. Inflation was 8.7 percent last month in Germany and 10.4 percent in Britain.

Welcome to A.I. boot camp
We have a new newsletter that will teach you, in just five days, everything you need to know about A.I. and chatbots. The first edition asks a deceptively simple question: What is “artificial intelligence”? Here’s some history to bring you up to speed.
In 2012, what shifted the entire field was the idea of a “neural network.” That’s basically a mathematical system that learns skills by finding statistical patterns. (By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat.) Neural networks allows services like Siri and Alexa to understand speech, identify people and objects in photos and translate languages.
Then came large language models. Around 2018, companies like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI began building neural networks that were trained on vast amounts of text.
Somewhat to the experts’ surprise, these systems learned to write unique prose and computer code and carry on sophisticated conversations. Such technology is sometimes called generative A.I., and it has laid the foundations for ChatGPT and other chatbots, which are poised to dramatically change our everyday lives.
Tomorrow, the newsletter will look at how chatbots work. Sign up here.

2023-03-29,"DUNDEE, Scotland — British kings and queens have worn it. Rebels, punk rockers and couture designers embraced or transformed it. And international drag stars like RuPaul and Cheddar Gorgeous strut their stuff in it.
It is tartan, the quintessential Scottish crisscross pattern famous for its use in kilts. And while Heritage Crafts, a British charity that works to safeguard traditional crafts, considers kiltmaking to be endangered, tartan itself is finding new audiences as contemporary fashion houses and avant-garde weavers do their best to explode that grid.
And “Tartan” also is the name of a wide-ranging exhibition set to open on Saturday at the V&A Dundee (a design museum connected with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London) on the banks of the River Tay.
[Kiltmakers and mills offer design-your-own services for tartans, including listing on a national registry.]

Experts say tartan is not just a textile but a pattern defined by some generally accepted rules: It should have at least two colors and a halftone that is created when they intersect; a grid motif that repeats; and a sense of proportion in which smaller and bigger spaces are balanced and harmonious.

“We’re really fascinated in how the grid can be disrupted and deconstructed by designers and artists, and used as a set of rules, really, to adapt, to reinvent,” one of the show’s curators, Mhairi Maxwell, 36, said recently, sitting in the museum’s cafe as she ran through a slide show of plans for the exhibition.
Another of its curators, Kirsty Hassard, 34, said the show was organized around five themes: the grid, innovation, identity, power and the transcendental aspects of tartan.

“We wanted to sort of blow apart tartan and put it back together,” she said. “So when you walk into the show, the first section you’re met with is ‘Tartan and the Grid.’ That’s really about how tartan is constructed and then how tartan has been used by designers, architects and artists alike as inspiration. How it’s the basis for loads of things in the world around us that you might not even know.”
(The main one, she said later, was that a tartan ribbon was the subject of the first color photograph, taken in 1861.) The exhibition’s section on identity examines how people have used tartan to express themselves through the centuries: by Scottish clans; as a symbol of rebellion in the Jacobite Risings and the subsequent British ban on Highland clothing in 1746; by the 1970s punk subculture; and by fashion designers like Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen.
More on Britain
General Election: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a snap general election for July 4, throwing the fate of his embattled Conservative Party to a restless British public months earlier than expected.
Cyberattack Fallout: Several London hospitals, still under significant strain after a cyberattack crippled services, have asked medical students to volunteer to help minimize disruption, as thousands of blood samples have had to be discarded and hundreds of operations postponed.
Reviving London’s Reputation: As fears have grown that the city is losing its attractiveness for publicly traded businesses, Britain’s government is making changes to bring them back.
A Lost Tudor Palace: In a small English village, a group of dedicated locals has unearthed the remains of a long-vanished palace that had been home to Henry VIII’s grandmother.
It also has been used by politicians, the military and royalty as a form of soft power. An example cited by the curators was a red and black tartan suit made for King George V in 1897 and later worn in the United States by his son Edward VIII. “It’s known as the suit of the two kings,” Ms. Maxwell said, “because, as far as we know, it’s the only suit that still survives that was worn by two kings.”
Serving as a sort of catalog for the exhibition is the book “Tartan” (2022 edition, Bloomsbury) by Jonathan Faiers, 63, professor of fashion thinking at the University of Southampton in southern England.
The author, who also served as a consultant curator for the Dundee show, said by email that he hoped visitors would understand “that tartan is so much more than just a ‘Scottish’ textile. I want visitors to be surprised!”

Royalty to Punks
Tartan’s origins remain elusive — even of the word itself. “It is possibly derived from the Gaelic tarsainn meaning across, the French tiretaine or tertaine, or the Spanish tiritana, all referring to woolen checked woven textiles,” Professor Faiers wrote.
Yet tartan remains popular, he noted, “because of its unique history, which means it is worn by radical and conservatives alike, from royalty to punks, provides an instant ‘tribal’ affinity with other tartan wearers, can be worn by all sexes and genders, and is visually stunning.”
One designer who unravels and reconstructs such cultural histories and identities is Olubiyi Thomas, 36.
Born in Nigeria and raised in Glasgow, he produced a work for “Tartan” called “Intersectional Family,” using ecru-colored mannequins of a mother, father and child wearing kilts, traditional West African headgear and copper masks. Behind them will be a textile he calls “Blood Line,” made of antique cotton and linen with a large hand-embroidered check pattern.

The mannequins are dressed in green and white, a color scheme he based in part on the Nigerian flag and in part on the colors of the Celtic soccer club in Glasgow. “When I was growing up, trying to figure out which team we supported,” Mr. Thomas said, “we went for Celtic because the color scheme was a direct link to the Nigerian flag.”

Questions about his own identity always arise, he said, and a tartan’s weave shows that identity, like tartan, is not as simple as being two things squashed side by side, and is more of a mesh that creates something new.
So he aimed to play off the tradition of tartan but also to “flip it, deconstruct it and then rebuild it and sort of present it in my own way,” he said. “Those lines, those squares, they’re all symbolic and significant of family, or eras or times or clans.”
The copper masks signify how slavery dehumanized people, reducing them to their economic value. “In Scotland, when people had slaves,” he said, “they would dress them head-to-toe in their family tartan so the people knew that the slaves belonged to them.”

“We produced about six meters of handmade tartan” in cotton and wool for the Thomas project, in “a really beautiful range of pine and dark browns and greens” that gave the impression of an early, muted tartan, Ms. McDougall, 44, said during a recent interview at her studio in Hastings, a town on England’s southeastern coast.
Along with spools of colorful threads and remnants of cashmere fabric, there were several modern and traditional looms in the work space that had been threaded with current projects and samples for clients. One sample that she called “quite experimental,” a “kind of trompe-l’oeil tartan” in black, orange and off-white wool, was in progress on a digital jacquard loom, its threading plan programmed onto a laptop.
“It’s hand-weaving, but it’s digitally programmed,” she explained. “So it feels like me, like half analog and half digital. I think anyone in their 40s feels a bit like that.”

She counts high-fashion labels such as Balenciaga, Burberry, Erdem, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and Schiaparelli among her customers: “For the past three or four months, we’ve just been weaving, weaving, weaving Fashion Week things.”
“I love tartan. And I think that’s possibly to do with being a Scot living out of Scotland is one thing,” she said. “I think in the beginning, tartan was about regionality and the dye stuffs and the materials that you had. It was about making a cloth that properly spoke of the landscape that you lived in.”

“I think I’ve probably made a career of trying to explode the grid,” she said. “Weaving a check or a tartan, you’re working to very strict guidelines. There’s so much precision involved. And as a person who’s not very precise, when I first started doing it, it was the thing that contained all that chaos for me, which was really good. But once I’ve kind of got into the discipline of it, I then wanted to break out of it.”
When it comes to a textile stereotype like a tartan, she said, “it’s about trying to push the parameters on the geometry of the loom. I’m always looking for ways, technically, to kind of get ’round this grid shape. It’s a challenge. And it’s a fun thing to do.”
Repeatedly moving the shuttle back and forth to capture threads could get boring. Not for her.
“I’m not a natural weaver in that I’m an impatient person. And there’s no instant gratification with weaving,” she said. “But I think there’s infinite possibility as a design and art and craft form. Each warp or group of threads that you put on is a new experience.”
In addition, she said, “You’re always thinking about where the thread travels through the cloth and how that creates a functionality. A drape, an aesthetic. And, you know, there’s always a form of sensuality with it as well. You’re thinking about the idea of touch.”

Living with Tartan
Tartan as a pattern has touched more than just fabric. The Dundee exhibition also shows how tartan is used across the world and on “a multitude of surfaces, whether that’s textiles, plastic, glass, metal,” said Ms. Hassard of V&A Dundee. “Almost anything you can think of, tartan has been transferred onto it.”
That is evident in items that form part of what the museum calls the People’s Tartan, comprising “donated pieces that are the sorts of objects that generally don’t end up in museums, everyday things people have in their homes or keep in their attics but with personal meanings,” Ms. Hassard said. Among the hundreds of items: tartan toilet paper, a tartan guitar and a tartan-upholstered Hillman Imp, a car first produced in the 1960s.
The tech world has also embraced tartan, Ms. Maxwell said, as she displayed a sample of the Xbox tartan commissioned by Microsoft to mark the 20th anniversary of the game console’s 2002 debut in Scotland. A fabric in predominantly black and (ironically) apple green covers the game’s wireless controller in a fine-wool pattern designed by Gordon Nicolson Kiltmakers in Edinburgh and woven at Lochcarron, a mill in Selkirk, Scotland.
“The inspiration behind this is pixels, and the neon colors speak to that world,” Ms. Maxwell said. “It’s so intricate, and it’s really pushing what a tartan can be.”
Tartan, contemporary or classic, also has its celebrity fans.

Tartan has “always been modern,” he said, “because I think of modern being about things that are au courant and very vital in our culture and our society.”
“It has been banned for being too dangerous. It’s been rebranded and reinvented and rediscovered by many, many different generations. And I just think it has this power. This weird collection of colors and lines and geometric patterns has sort of been used by so many different socioeconomic groups over the years to represent themselves. It’s both traditional and punk at the same time.”
When he wears it, he said, he feels more Scottish.
“I feel anyone can wear a tartan and they are making a statement of some kind. But when you’re Scottish and you wear it, you’re embracing a tradition and your whole sort of national identity. And it has an added layer of subversion, I think. And I do feel that tartan is very subversive, and I’ve worn it on several occasions for those very reasons.”
As for the future of tartan, Ms. Maxwell said that while “tartan is often defined by the outsider view — and that’s something we have fun with in the exhibition — it’s also what keeps it alive.”
“It’s so much a part of our kind of kitsch, parochial kind of pastiche, and of course we lean into that and we love to poke fun at ourselves,” she said. “But when you start to unpick tartan, and see how exciting designers — like Louise Gray, Olubiyi Thomas, Nicholas Daley, Owen Snaith and all these designers we’re featuring in the show — make it really relevant today, it’s really cool and it’s super fashionable and its relevancy just won’t go away.”"

2023-03-31,"Sundar Pichai has been trying to start an A.I. revolution for a very long time.
In 2016, shortly after being named Google’s chief executive, Mr. Pichai declared that Google was an “A.I.-first” company. He spent lavishly to assemble an all-star team of A.I. researchers, whose breakthroughs powered changes to products like Google Translate and Google Photos. He even predicted that A.I.’s impact would be bigger than “electricity or fire.”
So it had to sting when A.I.’s big moment finally arrived, and Google wasn’t involved.
Instead, OpenAI — a scrappy A.I. start-up backed by Microsoft — stole the spotlight in November by releasing ChatGPT, a poem-writing, code-generating, homework-finishing marvel. ChatGPT became an overnight sensation, attracting millions of users and kicking off a Silicon Valley frenzy. It made Google look sluggish and vulnerable for the first time in years. (It didn’t help when Microsoft relaunched its Bing search engine with OpenAI’s technology inside, instantly ending Bing’s decade-long run as a punchline.)
In an interview with The Times’s “Hard Fork” podcast on Thursday, his first extended interview since ChatGPT’s launch, Mr. Pichai said he was glad that A.I. was having a moment, even if Google wasn’t the driving force.
“It’s an exciting moment, regardless of whether we had done it,” Mr. Pichai said. “Obviously, you always wish you had done it.”

It’s been a wild few months at Google. In December, shortly after ChatGPT’s release, someone in management — Mr. Pichai swears it wasn’t him — declared a “code red,” instructing employees to shift time and resources toward A.I. projects. The company also established a fast-track review process to get A.I. projects out more quickly. And Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founders, who took a hands-off approach for years, rolled up their sleeves to help. The company plans to release a raft of new A.I. products this year and plug the technology into many of its existing ones. (This week, it began testing a new Gmail feature that allows users to compose A.I.-generated emails.)
Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.
On Thursday, Mr. Pichai expressed both optimism and worry about the state of the A.I. race.
He gave a blunt assessment of Bard, the ChatGPT competitor that Google released last week to tepid reviews: “I feel like we took a souped-up Civic and kind of put it in a race with more powerful cars.” (He also broke some news: Bard, which currently runs on a version of an A.I. language model called LaMDA, will soon be upgraded to a more powerful model, known as PaLM.)"

2023-04-04,"Ian Sansavera, a software architect at a New York start-up called Runway AI, typed a short description of what he wanted to see in a video. “A tranquil river in the forest,” he wrote.
Less than two minutes later, an experimental internet service generated a short video of a tranquil river in a forest. The river’s running water glistened in the sun as it cut between trees and ferns, turned a corner and splashed gently over rocks.
Runway, which plans to open its service to a small group of testers this week, is one of several companies building artificial intelligence technology that will soon let people generate videos simply by typing several words into a box on a computer screen.
They represent the next stage in an industry race — one that includes giants like Microsoft and Google as well as much smaller start-ups — to create new kinds of artificial intelligence systems that some believe could be the next big thing in technology, as important as web browsers or the iPhone.

The new video-generation systems could speed the work of moviemakers and other digital artists, while becoming a new and quick way to create hard-to-detect online misinformation, making it even harder to tell what’s real on the internet.
The systems are examples of what is known as generative A.I., which can instantly create text, images and sounds. Another example is ChatGPT, the online chatbot made by a San Francisco start-up, OpenAI, that stunned the tech industry with its abilities late last year.
Google and Meta, Facebook’s parent company, unveiled the first video-generation systems last year, but did not share them with the public because they were worried that the systems could eventually be used to spread disinformation with newfound speed and efficiency.
But Runway’s chief executive, Cristóbal Valenzuela, said he believed the technology was too important to keep in a research lab, despite its risks. “This is one of the single most impressive technologies we have built in the last hundred years,” he said. “You need to have people actually using it.”
The ability to edit and manipulate film and video is nothing new, of course. Filmmakers have been doing it for more than a century. In recent years, researchers and digital artists have been using various A.I. technologies and software programs to create and edit videos that are often called deepfake videos.

But systems like the one Runway has created could, in time, replace editing skills with the press of a button.
Runway’s technology generates videos from any short description. To start, you simply type a description much as you would type a quick note.

That works best if the scene has some action — but not too much action — something like “a rainy day in the big city” or “a dog with a cellphone in the park.” Hit enter, and the system generates a video in a minute or two.

The technology can reproduce common images, like a cat sleeping on a rug. Or it can combine disparate concepts to generate videos that are strangely amusing, like a cow at a birthday party.

The videos are only four seconds long, and the video is choppy and blurry if you look closely. Sometimes, the images are weird, distorted and disturbing. The system has a way of merging animals like dogs and cats with inanimate objects like balls and cellphones. But given the right prompt, it produces videos that show where the technology is headed.
“At this point, if I see a high-resolution video, I am probably going to trust it,” said Phillip Isola, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in A.I. “But that will change pretty quickly.”
Like other generative A.I. technologies, Runway’s system learns by analyzing digital data — in this case, photos, videos and captions describing what those images contain. By training this kind of technology on increasingly large amounts of data, researchers are confident they can rapidly improve and expand its skills. Soon, experts believe, they will generate professional-looking mini-movies, complete with music and dialogue.
It is difficult to define what the system creates currently. It’s not a photo. It’s not a cartoon. It’s a collection of a lot of pixels blended together to create a realistic video. The company plans to offer its technology with other tools that it believes will speed up the work of professional artists.

Several start-ups, including OpenAI, have released similar technology that can generate still images from short prompts like “photo of a teddy bear riding a skateboard in Times Square.” And the rapid advancement of A.I.-generated photos could suggest where the new video technology is going.

Last month, social media services were teeming with images of Pope Francis in a white Balenciaga puffer coat — surprisingly trendy attire for an 86-year-old pontiff. But the images were not real. A 31-year-old construction worker from Chicago had created the viral sensation using a popular A.I. tool called Midjourney.
Dr. Isola has spent years building and testing this kind of technology, first as a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and at OpenAI, and then as a professor at M.I.T. Still, he was fooled by the sharp, high-resolution but completely fake images of Pope Francis.

“There was a time when people would post deepfakes and they wouldn’t fool me, because they were so outlandish or not very realistic,” he said. “Now, we can’t take any of the images we see on the internet at face value.”
Midjourney is one of many services that can generate realistic still images from a short prompt. Others include Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, an OpenAI technology that started this wave of photo generators when it was unveiled a year ago.
Midjourney relies on a neural network, which learns its skills by analyzing enormous amounts of data. It looks for patterns as it combs through millions of digital images as well as text captions that describe the images depict.
When someone describes an image for the system, it generates a list of features that the image might include. One feature might be the curve at the top of a dog’s ear. Another might be the edge of a cellphone. Then, a second neural network, called a diffusion model, creates the image and generates the pixels needed for the features. It eventually transforms the pixels into a coherent image.

Companies like Runway, which has roughly 40 employees and has raised $95.5 million, are using this technique to generate moving images. By analyzing thousands of videos, their technology can learn to string many still images together in a similarly coherent way.
“A video is just a series of frames — still images — that are combined in a way that gives the illusion of movement,” Mr. Valenzuela said. “The trick lies in training a model that understands the relationship and consistency between each frame.”
Like early versions of tools such as DALL-E and Midjourney, the technology sometimes combines concepts and images in curious ways. If you ask for a teddy bear playing basketball, it might give a kind of mutant stuffed animal with a basketball for a hand. If you ask for a dog with a cellphone in the park, it might give you a cellphone-wielding pup with an oddly human body.
But experts believe they can iron out the flaws as they train their systems on more and more data. They believe the technology will ultimately make creating a video as easy as writing a sentence.
“In the old days, to do anything remotely like this, you had to have a camera. You had to have props. You had to have a location. You had to have permission. You had to have money,” said Susan Bonser, an author and a publisher in Pennsylvania who has been experimenting with early incarnations of generative video technology. “You don’t have to have any of that now. You can just sit down and imagine it.”"
2023-04-05,"Trying to obtain an internship at a leading tech company or start-up can be a depressing quest for many college students, requiring a sustained, semester-long effort — often with little to show for it but a slew of rejections.
Now Bowie State University, a historically Black university in Bowie, Md., has created its own internship placement program. And it does not require undergraduates to jump through standard Silicon Valley hoops, such as spending countless hours studying for company coding tests or taking high-pressure technical assessments while a tech company interviewer looks on.
“To be honest with you, it’s a brutal process,” said Rose Shumba, the chair of Bowie State’s computer science department, referring to the internship application process at many large tech firms. She described trying to buoy stressed-out students as they prepared for technical interviews that she thought did not assess their skills or professional potential. “We see things very differently here at Bowie.”
To widen opportunities for students, the computer science department set up its own internship placement program last year in partnership with a number of companies and government agencies. The program aims to match students directly with employers seeking interns. It also holds training sessions for students on interview skills and workshops on hot topics like machine learning.

The Bowie approach offers students an alternative to the impersonal, mass-scale application system at many large tech firms. That process typically involves tens of thousands of college students submitting their résumés cold to online company portals, where candidates are initially sorted and ranked by résumé-reading software.
At Bowie State, participating employers come frequently to campus to get to know, mentor, interview and directly recruit students for internships in a process that is more intimate than the one-off information sessions that tech companies often arrange with university career centers. And the Bowie process does not typically involve high-stress technical tests. That has spared many students, some of whom have part-time jobs, from spending dozens of unpaid hours on applying for Silicon Valley internship programs.
‌Founded in 1865, Bowie State is a computer science powerhouse among ‌‌historically Black universities. The school is known nationally for its expertise in cybersecurity education. Last fall, the number of Bowie undergraduates majoring in computing soared to 332, a 75 percent jump from 2019.
But over the last several years only a few Bowie students have made it past the vetting process at leading tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle to obtain internships, Dr. Shumba said.
The competition can be stiff. Adobe, the maker of Photoshop, said it typically hires about 600 interns from the more than 100,000 candidates who apply for its summer internship program in the United States each year.

Last summer, with the new program in place, 60 Bowie computing students interned with companies like Deloitte, federal agencies like NASA and local start-ups. One of them was Dejai Brown, now a senior, who is interested in cybersecurity.

Before she started applying for internships, Ms. Brown worked part time at Chick-fil-A. Last year, after Dr. Shumba encouraged her to apply for a government security clearance, Ms. Brown got an internship at the Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command. She also interned at Battelle, a nonprofit technology research giant.
“Recruiters at Battelle reached out to me, took me through the interview process, and they ended up bringing me on,” Ms. Brown, 21, said. “That was a lot less stressful than what it could have been with a coding interview.”
The Bowie State program addresses socioeconomic barriers — like lack of technical work experience or industry connections — that can hinder some students from getting internships.

To help younger students gain relevant experience, Dr. Shumba set up computing research internships on campus. Last year, she also took a group of students on an all-expenses paid trip to the Grace Hopper Celebration in Florida, a major annual conference for women in tech. Six students returned to campus with internship or job offers from Apple, Bank of America, Citibank and other companies.
Among them was Roxan Rockefeller, now a junior, who worked as a software engineering intern last summer at Tata Consultancy Services, a tech company. Then last fall at the conference, she attended an information session by Eli Lilly, the drug giant. That led to an internship interview.

“I have a passion for data, and I just started talking about how I want to explore as many areas as possible with my computer science degree,” Ms. Rockefeller, 21, said. “The next day I got a call from one of the recruiters telling me on the phone that I got the internship.”
This year, Adobe started its own internship program with Bowie State, focused on cybersecurity. The internships are part of a larger company effort to help prepare more Black and Latino students for tech careers.

Employment grew at a healthy rate last month, but one that nonetheless signified that employers are pulling back as steadily rising interest rates take their toll.

Job creation has remained far stronger than many forecasters expected. That growth has delighted President Biden and helped the economy avoid a recession. The cooling in job and wage growth is also good news for the Federal Reserve in its campaign to bring down inflation by raising interest rates.
However, some analysts are not convinced that it will be smooth sailing in the months ahead. The job data was collected before two midsize banks failed last month, and some have warned about the potential for a rapid deceleration in hiring as banks pull back on lending.

The documents, which were posted this week on social media, contain American and NATO plans for building up the Ukrainian military ahead of a planned offensive against Russian troops, Biden administration officials said. The Pentagon has launched an investigation to identify the source of the leak, which contained photographs of charts of anticipated weapons deliveries, troop and battalion strengths, and other plans.
Military analysts said the documents appear to have been modified — overstating American estimates of Ukrainian war dead and understating estimates of Russian troops killed — which could point to a disinformation effort by Moscow. Officials in both Russia and Ukraine cast doubt on the leak, suggesting that it could have been a ploy by the other side.
In related news, a separate batch of classified documents that appear to detail U.S. security secrets on Ukraine, the Middle East and China surfaced online today. The scale of the leak could be hugely damaging, officials said.
In other news from the war, Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter jailed in Moscow, was formally charged with espionage. One correspondent says his arrest has had a “chilling effect” on journalism in Russia.

3. Donald Trump is betting that his presidential campaign can help his criminal case.
As he faces the first-ever criminal prosecution of a former president, Trump is planning to blur the lines between his legal and political battles, according to his aides and allies. His strategy is to paint himself as a victim of Democratic persecution and generate enough support to win his acquittal, deter other prosecutors from seeking additional indictments and boost his campaign.
Trump’s lawyers have told him that his plan is unlikely to work, and there seems to be little upside to any indictment. Still, Trump is already trying to capitalize on the case: His campaign is selling T-shirts that read “I STAND WITH TRUMP” and have the date 03-30-2023 — the day he was indicted.

4. Israel bombarded Lebanon in retaliation for a barrage of rocket attacks.
Israeli warplanes struck three sites overnight in Lebanon that the military said were controlled by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, in retaliation for a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon across Israel’s northern border. The exchange was seen as the most serious escalation along the border in more than 15 years.
Much of the fighting had subsided by Friday morning, and all sides appeared intent on containing the cross-border violence. But the attacks raised fears of a wider conflict as frictions in Israel have steadily climbed over the last week. On Wednesday, the Israeli police raided a mosque in Jerusalem after Palestinians barricaded themselves inside.
In other international news, uniformed Mexican soldiers shot and killed unarmed civilians, including an American, in Nuevo Laredo in late February. The incident has underscored how one of the country’s most powerful institutions operates with little oversight.

5. New car rules are designed to be so tough that carmakers will have to turn to electric vehicles.
As early as next week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to propose an ambitious set of restrictions on vehicle tailpipe pollution. The standards are set to be intentionally onerous in an effort to ensure that at least half of the new vehicles sold in the U.S. are all-electric by 2030. The rules could also put the nation on track to end sales of new gasoline-powered cars as soon as 2035.
Today, just 5.8 percent of cars sold are all-electric. Scientists say that quickly slashing pollution from tailpipes is essential for averting the most catastrophic impacts of global warming.

6. When launching their A.I. chatbots, Microsoft and Google chose speed over caution.
Employees at the normally risk-adverse companies warned against launching their respective A.I. tools, arguing the technology was still too inaccurate and could erode the factual foundation of modern society. But Microsoft and Google released their chatbots anyway, driven by a race to control what could be the tech industry’s next big thing.

Now that Covid restrictions have been all but eliminated, the music industry’s biggest stars are performing in packed arenas around the world. Fans of Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Drake and more have a chance to see them perform this year. But it’s not going to be cheap.

The once simple act of buying a concert ticket has morphed into a frustrating mess of high prices, anxiety-inducing presale registrations and pervasive scalping. Acts like Springsteen, who built his reputation as a man of the people with his bargain rates over the years, shocked fans with “dynamic pricing,” which sends prices skyrocketing when demand spikes.

8. The World Chess Championship begins this weekend — without the world’s best player.
The marathon best-of-14 match between Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and Ding Liren of China begins on Sunday in Astana, Kazakhstan, and will conclude by the end of the month with a new world champion.
But some have questioned the legitimacy of this year’s title because the world’s No. 1 player, Magnus Carlsen, decided to skip the event. He said that he lacked the motivation to prepare for another challenge, robbing the championship of its most compelling draw.

10. And finally, a real-life Willy Wonka experience.
At the Peeps factory in Bethlehem, Pa., pipes stuffed with marshmallows snake around the building while spray guns mist food coloring into the air. During this Easter season, the factory pumps out 5.5 million fluffy marshmallows each day in the shapes of bunnies, skulls and, of course, the classic yellow chick.
The entire process takes just six minutes, but requires an intricate combination of specialized machines and trained workers to ensure consistency. We went inside the factory and photographed each step of the process.

April 8, 2023
Seeing has not been believing for a very long time. Photos have been faked and manipulated for nearly as long as photography has existed.
Now, not even reality is required for photographs to look authentic — just artificial intelligence responding to a prompt. Even experts sometimes struggle to tell if one is real or not. Can you?
Which image was created by artificial intelligence? Click on your guess
The rapid advent of artificial intelligence has set off alarms that the technology used to trick people is advancing far faster than the technology that can identify the tricks. Tech companies, researchers, photo agencies and news organizations are scrambling to catch up, trying to establish standards for content provenance and ownership.
The advancements are already fueling disinformation and being used to stoke political divisions. Authoritarian governments have created seemingly realistic news broadcasters to advance their political goals. Last month, some people fell for images showing Pope Francis donning a puffy Balenciaga jacket and an earthquake devastating the Pacific Northwest, even though neither of those events had occurred. The images had been created using Midjourney, a popular image generator.
On Tuesday, as former President Donald J. Trump turned himself in at the Manhattan district attorney’s office to face criminal charges, images generated by artificial intelligence appeared on Reddit showing the actor Bill Murray as president in the White House. Another image showing Mr. Trump marching in front of a large crowd with American flags in the background was quickly reshared on Twitter without the disclosure that had accompanied the original post, noting it was not actually a photograph.

2023-04-12,"“Raise your hand if you know who is getting fired?” a Meta employee wrote in an online chat group for the company’s engineers this month. “Fire emoji if you think it’s a dumpster fire.”
In response, his colleagues posted dozens of tiny flame emojis.
“I’m already fired,” added a former Meta employee who worked in the company’s business division for nearly four years before most of his team was laid off this year. “But who can keep track?”
Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, has declared that 2023 will be the “year of efficiency” at his company. So far, efficiency has translated into mass layoffs. He has conducted two rounds of cuts over the past six months, with two more to come; these will eliminate more than 21,000 people. Mr. Zuckerberg is also closing 5,000 open positions, which amounts to 30 percent of his company’s work force.

The layoffs and absentee leadership, along with concerns that Mr. Zuckerberg is making a bad bet on the future, have devastated employee morale at Meta, according to nine current and former employees, as well as messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Employees at Meta, which not long ago was one of the most desirable workplaces in Silicon Valley, face an increasingly precarious future. The company’s stock price has dropped 43 percent from its peak 19 months ago. More layoffs, Mr. Zuckerberg has said on his Facebook page, are coming this month. Some of those cuts could be in engineering groups, which would have been unthinkable before the trouble started last year, two employees said.
“So many of the employees feel like they’re in limbo right now,” said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. “They’re saying it’s ‘Hunger Games’ meets ‘Lord of the Flies,’ where everyone is trying to prove their worth to management.”
Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is not the only big tech company that has hit the brakes on spending. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others have laid off thousands of workers in recent months, shed office space, dropped perks and pulled back from experimental initiatives.

But Meta appears to face the most challenges. Last year, the company reported consecutive quarters of declining revenue — a first since it became a public company in 2012.
While Meta’s peers are chasing a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence, Mr. Zuckerberg has made a big bet on the metaverse, an immersive online world. But it is unclear if consumers will embrace his vision in the way he hopes. While the company has sold 20 million virtual reality headsets — more than any other company producing similar tech — it has struggled to keep customers returning regularly to use the product.

Many workers at Meta had already been skeptical of Mr. Zuckerberg’s shift toward the metaverse. Those concerns have grown as consumer enthusiasm for the virtual world has lagged, the employees said.
The absence of many top executives from Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., is compounding worries. Mr. Zuckerberg, 38, is on parental leave after the birth of his third child, three Meta employees said, but is regularly meeting with executives on important topics. (A.I. is at the top of that list.)

While the executives have been joining Meta’s weekly meetings through video chats, their absence from the Menlo Park offices has been felt, employees said, especially since Mr. Zuckerberg recently stressed that he expected employees to return to the office.

A spokesman for Meta said its executives continued to travel regularly to the Silicon Valley offices.
Within Meta, there is pressure to demonstrate that people are working hard, two employees said. Intense scrutiny has come in recent workplace reviews. Workers, especially in middle management, are being asked to justify why their jobs are crucial to Meta’s goals.
Some employees are trying to make themselves look busier, two people said. That has made people more possessive about their work, the people said, which has meant less collaborating with co-workers. One person described the atmosphere as “cutthroat.”
Meta declined to comment on internal matters.
While the first two rounds of layoffs largely affected business and recruiting teams, the cuts expected this month will focus on tech departments, including engineers, which has surprised employees, said four employees, who were not authorized to speak to reporters. Insiders expect engineering cuts to hit teams inside WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, they said.
In one of his regular question-and-answer sessions with employees this year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that there was no “perfect way to do” layoffs, and that he wanted to err on the side of providing more information about upcoming layoffs as news of the cuts began to leak to the press. The Information previously reported on the meeting.

Meta employees have created memes and inside jokes about how much time workers have left. In messaging groups and workplace chats in recent weeks, they have been using skull-and-bones emojis to signal to one another that they may be part of the layoffs, according to screenshots seen by The Times.
Those remaining have griped about reduced bonuses and perks. One engineer created a bot that would automatically calculate the loss in the value of Meta stock held by employees, part of their compensation package.
The cutbacks include trimming Meta’s real estate. The company has terminated leases for offices across the Bay Area, including space in San Francisco, Fremont, Sunnyvale and Menlo Park, according to two people familiar with the cuts. In February, the company announced that it would pay to end leases early and cut Meta’s real estate contracts in some areas.
The company is also cutting back on some of its lavish perks, once considered necessary to attract top talent. Last year, Meta ended its free laundry service for employees and pushed dinner service later into the evening — a way to cut down on workers’ loading up free food to take home.

Workers complained in internal chat rooms that the company was cutting back on amenities. One was frustrated that there was no more cereal in the worker’s office, and that snacks in “micro-kitchens” were not being restocked as regularly. Many believed that cafeteria options had gone downhill.
Employee travel expenses are also being scrutinized more closely, and workers have been asked to cut down on nonessential travel.
At WhatsApp, Meta’s popular messaging product, insiders are anticipating fewer cuts and structural changes on the business side than in the rest of the company, two current employees said. Mr. Zuckerberg wants to increase the cadence of delivering new, revenue-generating features in WhatsApp, which he bought nine years ago for $19 billion.
While employees complain they aren’t hearing enough from Mr. Zuckerberg, he still surprised some this year when he dropped into a discussion group for Metamates, the name given to employees.
Workers were gossiping about a recent news article that noted Sergey Brin and Larry Page’s return to Google to assist with the company’s artificial intelligence strategy, two employees who witnessed the exchange said. One worker joked how the founders’ return might inspire Mr. Zuckerberg to get back to coding at Facebook.

2023-04-13,"Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a harsh critic of former President Donald J. Trump, has helped pay for a lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, the New York magazine writer who sued Mr. Trump for rape and defamation, according to newly filed court papers in the case.
Mr. Hoffman’s support for Ms. Carroll’s lawsuit, which was first disclosed in a letter to a judge on Thursday by Mr. Trump’s lawyers, has sparked a sharp dispute in the case, which is scheduled for trial in federal court in Manhattan on April 25.
Mr. Trump’s lawyers, writing to the judge, accused Ms. Carroll of concealing Mr. Hoffman’s role, which they said they only learned of this week from her lawyers. They said the disclosure raised “significant questions” about Ms. Carroll’s credibility and whether her allegations against Mr. Trump were, as he has claimed, a “hoax” brought “to advance a political agenda.”
They asked for a one-month postponement so they could investigate the funding issue. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, on Thursday evening said he would allow Mr. Trump’s lawyers the opportunity to conduct a narrow inquiry into the funding issue, but he declined to delay the case.
Ms. Carroll’s lawyers in their own letter argued that the financial support was irrelevant to Ms. Carroll’s legal claims and that she had nothing to do with obtaining the outside funding and no dealings with anyone associated with the nonprofit.
They noted that it was not until September 2020, almost a year after Ms. Carroll filed the first of what became two lawsuits against Mr. Trump, that their firm obtained the funding to help pay “certain costs and fees.”

2023-04-14,"It’s awfully hard to beat the stock market consistently. In 2022, despite many advantages, most mutual funds couldn’t do it. There are important lessons in that failure for this year and beyond.
Recall that the S&P 500 declined 19.4 percent last year. It was a miserable time for just about anyone who held stocks, including those who merely tried to match the overall market, as I do, using broadly diversified, low-cost index funds.
But beneath the market’s surface last year, there were plenty of opportunities that should have given active stock pickers a competitive advantage over index funds. That’s because the average stock did better than the overall market, which was heavily influenced by a relative handful of “megacap” tech stocks like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These giants declined sharply, but the rest of the market did markedly better.
That meant the odds actually favored stock pickers last year. They had plenty of companies to choose from, any one of which would have given them a better performance than the overall market. And, in fact, as a group, actively managed mutual funds fared better against the overall market average than they have since 2009.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Even so, the average actively managed stock mutual fund failed to beat the S&P 500. In an interview, Anu R. Ganti, senior director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, summarized that mediocre performance this way. “Actively managed funds underperformed less badly in 2022 than they have in most years,” she said. “But they still underperformed.”
Tailwinds Helped, but Not Much
In some respects, the failure of actively managed mutual funds to beat the broad market indexes last year is unsurprising. S&P Dow Jones Indices has been running systematic comparisons of actively managed funds and passively managed funds — a.k.a. index funds — since 2001.
These studies have consistently found that the vast majority of active fund managers just can’t beat the indexes over 10- or 20-year periods, or in most individual years, either.
From 2010 through 2021, anywhere from 55 percent to 87 percent of actively managed funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks couldn’t beat that benchmark in any given year.
Compared with that, the results for 2022 were cause for celebration: About 51 percent of large-cap stock funds failed to beat the S&P 500.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Active managers couldn’t quite achieve what random chance would predict — that 50 percent of actively managed funds would beat the index.
In other words, their performance for 2022 looks slightly worse than the results of a random coin flip.
That’s unimpressive, but it was much worse over longer periods. Consider these tallies for funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks through the end of 2022:
Over three years, 74.3 percent of actively managed funds trailed the index.
Over five years, 86.5 percent underperformed.
Over 10 years, 91.4 percent underperformed.
Over 20 years, 94.8 percent underperformed.
As the numbers show, the longer you ran the horse race, the more actively managed funds fell behind.
Over 20 years through April 11, the SPDR S&P 500 E.T.F. — one of the many mutual funds and exchange-traded index funds that track the S&P 500 — returned nearly 10 percent, annualized. The vast majority of active, stock-picking funds couldn’t match that.
The Odds Have Gotten Worse
When you look carefully at the results for 2022, the performance of actively managed funds is much worse than it may seem at first glance, because it really wasn’t a coin flip.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
For the stock market, 2022 was a special year. If there was any year in which stock pickers should have been able to outperform the broad market indexes, 2022 was it, yet most still couldn’t beat the battered stock market.
That augurs poorly for active managers in 2023 because, so far at least, the odds have shifted.
Once again, consider “megacap” tech stocks, which had terrible performances last year — much worse than the S&P 500 as a whole. The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index, which means that the most valuable stocks in the markets, like those from the big tech companies, have an outsize effect on stock market returns. When they decline, the overall index tends to decline. When they rise, the overall market tends to rise. Often the market moves in lock step, with many stocks heading in the same direction.
But last year, the monthly “dispersion” of the S&P 500, which measures “the magnitude of differences” in the returns of individual stocks in the index, was at its highest level since 2009. This means that there was more variation in stock returns, and most individual stocks did much better than the megacap stocks. You can see this by comparing the standard S&P 500 with an equal-weighted version, in which a stock like Dish Network, with a market capitalization of less than $5 billion, has the same weight as a colossus like Apple, with a market cap of well over $2 trillion.
In 2022, the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperformed the standard index by nearly seven percentage points. That implies that if you just picked stocks randomly last year, you should have done better than the overall index because the typical random stock did better than the megacaps and better than the S&P 500. But most active managers couldn’t do it.
Their chances are worse this year because the market so far has been very different. Megacap stocks have been outperforming the average stock in the S&P 500 index, and the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 has been trailing the standard, cap-weighted index. That implies that if you just pick stocks randomly, odds are that you will trail the overall stock market this year.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
And, in fact, preliminary tallies by Bank of America show that in a horse race between active large-cap mutual fund managers and the S&P 500 this year, the active managers have been clobbered. Only 45 percent of active large-cap stock managers have matched the performance of the S&P 500. Stock pickers are doing better in some corners of the market, but for the most part, it’s a dismal picture
Improving Your Chances
It’s definitely possible to beat the stock market. A small number of people will probably to do it over the next 20 years. But I don’t know now who those outliers will be. Similarly, I don’t know the precise direction of the economy or of inflation or of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies or of a host of other monumentally important factors. No one else knows, either.
That’s why I think it makes sense to embrace humility, accept my limitations and use low-cost index funds to try to match the returns of the stock and bond markets over the long run.
To do that, and to withstand the wrenching shifts in the markets that will surely come, I’ll need enough cash on hand to pay the bills first. Money-market funds and high-yield, federally insured savings accounts and certificates of deposit are reasonable options for that purpose.
Make your own choice. Some active stock pickers will beat the market averages this year. But based on history, I think it’s virtually certain that the vast majority won’t manage to do it over the next 20 years.

2023-04-16,"Google’s employees were shocked when they learned in March that the South Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung was considering replacing Google with Microsoft’s Bing as the default search engine on its devices.
For years, Bing had been a search engine also-ran. But it became a lot more interesting to industry insiders when it recently added new artificial intelligence technology.
Google’s reaction to the Samsung threat was “panic,” according to internal messages reviewed by The New York Times. An estimated $3 billion in annual revenue was at stake with the Samsung contract. An additional $20 billion is tied to a similar Apple contract that will be up for renewal this year.
A.I. competitors like the new Bing are quickly becoming the most serious threat to Google’s search business in 25 years, and in response, Google is racing to build an all-new search engine powered by the technology. It is also upgrading the existing one with A.I. features, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.

The new features, under the project name Magi, are being created by designers, engineers and executives working in so-called sprint rooms to tweak and test the latest versions.

Starting tomorrow, Fox News is scheduled to be on trial. Dominion Voting Systems, which makes voting machines, is suing the cable news network for $1.6 billion. Dominion claims that Fox spread a false conspiracy theory that its machines were rigged against Donald Trump in the 2020 election.
The trial had been set to start today, but the judge overseeing the case announced a one-day delay last night. Fox may be seeking to settle the case before a trial can begin, The Wall Street Journal reported.
We have already seen some of the evidence for Dominion’s side. Texts and emails uncovered through the lawsuit show that several of Fox’s executives, hosts and producers privately doubted the claims against Dominion, which were promoted by Trump, but amplified them on the air anyway.
Even with this evidence, Dominion may not have an easy time winning the case because of legal protections for media companies. Those protections were established by a 1964 Supreme Court ruling, New York Times v. Sullivan, based on the First Amendment’s safeguards for freedom of speech and the press. The ruling requires that defamation lawsuits by public figures against media companies prove “actual malice,” meaning that journalists must have known an allegation was false but broadcast it anyway or have acted so recklessly that they overlooked the facts.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“It is an incredibly high bar to prove,” said my colleague Katie Robertson, who is covering the lawsuit.
The case will test whether Fox’s brand of journalism — which includes a long record of spreading falsehoods (such as about where Barack Obama was born) — is legally vulnerable. Today’s newsletter will look at both sides of the case and its broader implications.
What is Dominion’s argument?
There is no doubt that Trump’s allegations against Dominion were false. The judge overseeing the case, Eric Davis of the Delaware Superior Court, has already ruled that Dominion won’t have to prove that the claims were wrong during the trial. Its task will be proving actual malice, as well as proving financial damage because of the coverage.
To do that, Dominion will point to a trove of texts, emails and other documents showing that Fox News’s leaders and hosts doubted the claims against Dominion but aired them anyway.
Referring to claims that Dominion’s software rigged the election, Tucker Carlson texted his producer, Alex Pfeiffer, that the idea was “absurd.” He also texted that Sidney Powell, one of Trump’s lawyers, was “lying.” Yet Carlson later argued on his show, “This is a real issue no matter who raises it or who tries to dismiss it out of hand as a conspiracy theory.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Why did Carlson do this? It seems the answer has to do with his audience. Carlson initially cast doubt on Powell’s claims on air, saying, “She never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another. Not one.” His audience revolted, criticizing him for questioning a Trump ally. Carlson then walked back his public skepticism on air.
It’s a recurring theme in the texts and emails. Fox’s leaders and hosts expressed doubt about the conspiracy theory in private, but they also raised concerns about “respecting our audience.” To avoid losing viewers to competitors like Newsmax, Fox hosts and producers seemingly chose to broadcast and support the claims by Trump and his allies.
What is Fox News’s argument?
Fox News previously argued that even though it knew the claims against Dominion were false, it had to cover them anyway because they were newsworthy. But Judge Davis has ruled that Fox won’t be able to make that argument in the trial. “Just because someone is newsworthy,” he said, referring to Trump and his lawyers, “doesn’t mean you can defame someone.”
Without that argument, Fox has focused on others. The network argues that Dominion still needs to prove that Fox’s hosts — who ultimately decide what to air — knew the claims were false and broadcast them anyway. And Fox claims that at least some of the hosts genuinely believed the allegations and therefore were not intentionally defaming anyone.
Mostly, though, Fox is relying on Dominion failing to clear the high legal standard established by New York Times v. Sullivan. Dominion, not Fox, has the burden of proof.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Legal experts have said that Dominion’s case is stronger than most defamation lawsuits but that the company still may not win. “Proving this in a legal sense is more complicated than proving it in the court of public opinion,” said my colleague Jim Rutenberg, who wrote a Times Magazine article about the case.
What are the implications?
Fox News argues that if it loses, the case will do irreparable damage to press freedoms, opening all news outlets to lawsuits. “A free-flowing, robust American discourse depends on First Amendment protections for the press’ news gathering and reporting,” a network spokesperson said in a statement.
Some legal experts argue the opposite, saying that a loss for Fox could bolster protections for the press. Fox’s actions in covering the 2020 election were so egregious, the argument goes, that any legal standard that protected them would be no standard at all: For First Amendment protections to endure, news organizations need to be held accountable for knowingly spreading false and damaging information.

Goldman Sachs shares fell as much as 4 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday.

Big banks show their strength
Bank of America reported on Tuesday that deposits fell less than analysts had expected last quarter, and BNY Mellon reported a slight increase in deposits, pushing their shares up in premarket trading as investors see more evidence that the country’s biggest lenders grew stronger after Silicon Valley Bank’s demise last month.
A major outlier: Goldman Sachs, which reported revenues that came in below Wall Street’s forecasts, booked a $470 million loss on efforts to sell loans connected with its struggling Marcus consumer banking unit. Its stock fell nearly 4 percent lower in premarket.
The outlook is far cloudier for smaller banks. State Street, M&T Bank and Charles Schwab on Monday reported nearly $60 billion in deposit outflows last quarter. State Street’s shares fell more than 9 percent on Monday, its worst single-day performance in three years. Schwab halted its stock buyback plans, citing market uncertainty.
Banks are under pressure to raise interest rates to stem the deposit exodus. About $12 billion in deposits left State Street last quarter as customers sought higher rates elsewhere, according to Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

Per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the average savings deposit account at a U.S. bank pays out 0.37 percent in interest. That looks miserly, especially after the Fed raised up the federal funds rate to nearly 5 percent over the past year: The gap between the Fed’s prime lending rate and the average deposit rate has reached a multidecade high.
Look for rivals to exploit that gap. Apple and Goldman Sachs on Monday announced a savings account that pays 4.15 percent in interest. Goldman’s Marcus offers a savings account with a 3.9 percent interest rate.
Despite banking uncertainty, stocks broadly continue to rise. The S&P 500 is up 7.5 percent since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. But concerns are growing about a recession in the second half of the year, a weak earnings season and the turmoil surrounding lenders prompting a credit crunch.
Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief investment officer, warned investors on Tuesday about consumers having drawn more than $1 trillion worth of deposits out of American banks, suggesting that “a credit crunch has started.”

McCarthy has a tough task: He has a slim majority to pass his plan, and the Democratic-led Senate won’t entertain his offer.
Consulting giants delay start dates for some business-school recruits. According to The Wall Street Journal, Bain & Company has offered M.B.A. recruits up to $40,000 if they start next year and take on other projects like working at a nonprofit group or becoming a yoga instructor until then; as of Monday, McKinsey & Company hadn’t given many recruits start dates.

Why China’s economic data isn’t all good
China on Tuesday published solid economic data for the first full quarter since Beijing lifted strict Covid-19 restrictions. The numbers will give hope that the world’s second-biggest economy has turned a corner. But the recovery was uneven and bolstered by a low base effect after last year’s rolling lockdowns, and big questions persist about the country’s management of the economy and private enterprise.
G.D.P. expanded 4.5 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, beating analysts’ forecasts and up from 2.9 percent in the last three months of 2022. The figures are close to the government’s full-year growth target of 5 percent; analysts expect the recovery to accelerate over the coming months as pent-up demand is unleashed.

Big drivers included retail sales, which rose 5.8 percent year-on-year, and were up 10.6 percent in March alone; outbound trade, which climbed 8.4 percent; and government spending on infrastructure, which jumped 8.8 percent.
But big worries persist. The property sector, which has accounted for about a quarter of gross domestic product over the past decade, is still a drag, with the construction of new homes, offices and stores falling 5.8 percent year on year.

Elon Musk opens up about “TruthGPT”
In a long-awaited interview with the Fox News host Tucker Carlson that aired on Monday, Elon Musk discussed a wide range of topics, including a claim — made without evidence — that the U.S. government had “full access” to Twitter users’ direct messages and an admission that the social network’s valuation had plunged since he bought it.
Musk also opened up about another preoccupation: creating an alternative artificial intelligence start-up to OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT that he had once backed. But the billionaire said he had different goals than tech giants racing to introduce A.I.-infused products.
ADVERTISEMENT

Musk wants a “maximum truth-seeking A.I.,” which he calls TruthGPT. (Last month, he filed to start a new company, X.AI, in Nevada.) Musk offered no concrete details about the proposed start-up, but said it would focus on creating software that “tries to understand the nature of the universe.”
That approach contrasts with what he called the “two heavyweights” of the A.I. race, Microsoft and Google, which he said were too focused on profits and not enough on safety.
Musk has been fixated on the dangers of A.I. for some time. Last month, he and others wrote an open letter calling for a pause in the development of artificial intelligence, citing fears that developers were creating giant experiments that they could not “understand, predict or reliably control.”
In other Musk news:
Musk suggested that Twitter’s steep valuation drop was attributed to buying the company just before a cyclical drop in digital advertising spending, not to any actions he had taken. He’s scheduled to be interviewed onstage on Tuesday at the Possible digital marketing conference.

The S.E.C.’s chief in the hot seat
The S.E.C. chairman, Gary Gensler, will face questions from the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday for the first time since Republicans took over leadership of the chamber. Based on recent statements from its chairman, Representative Patrick McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, the exchanges could get explosive.
McHenry has accused Gensler of stonewalling his investigation into FTX, the crypto exchange that collapsed in November. He also threatened the use of “compulsory process” if the agency didn’t hand over documents about its charges in December against Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX founder.
Also high on the agenda are S.E.C. proposals to amend the definition of an “exchange” to potentially include digital asset trading platforms, which would introduce more agency oversight over operations and add more rigorous custody requirements for investment advisers looking to expand into crypto assets.
Climate disclosure rules could get heated, too. Last year, the S.E.C. proposed adding requirements for companies to publish details about climate risk management and emissions data, which for some large companies would include “Scope 3” emissions that stem downstream to suppliers.

McHenry has created a Republican working group focused on vetting environmental, social and governance policies. Its leader, Bill Huizenga of Michigan, has called the proposed climate disclosure rules “disastrous” and a “prime example” of regulatory overreach.
Proposed market structure changes are also on the agenda. The meme stock trading frenzy of 2021 shined a spotlight on the practice of payment for order flow in which market makers like Citadel Securities pay brokerage firms like Robinhood and Schwab for their flow of trades.
The S.E.C. has proposed changes to the practice that aim to give investors more transparency about the execution price for a particular trade. Wall Street has come out against the moves.

2023-04-20,"When it’s time for Lou Maxon to commute to work, he never has to worry about missing his train. Why? His office is the train.
When Mr. Maxon steps inside and pulls a lever, the entire two-story structure pulls away from his house in Carnation, Wash., and rolls down a 110-foot-long track — his own personal railroad.
“There’s a detachment to literally leaving the house,” said Mr. Maxon, 48, a creative director who has worked in branding and marketing for clients including Lexus, Microsoft and Lego, and who previously had a connected home office where he struggled with distractions.

Beyond the peace and quiet, the mobility of the building allows him to take in inspiring views. “There are different moments along the rail,” he said. “If you take it halfway, that’s where our fire pit is. If you take it all the way out, you move from being open to being really in the woods, where the light is just different.”
Image
When Lou Maxon, a creative director, is ready to begin his workday, he drives his studio along a 110-foot-long track in Carnation, Wash. Tom Kundig, a founder of the architecture firm Olson Kundig, designed the trainlike home office after listening to Mr. Maxon describe his desire for a place free of distractions.

Built from weathering steel and glass, with a metal door finished in bright yellow automotive paint, the studio measures just under 300 square feet. It was designed by Tom Kundig, the architect who founded the Seattle-based firm Olson Kundig. Known for its buildings with moving parts — from hand-cranked glass walls to camping huts mounted on enormous casters — the firm actually has a staff member with the job title of gizmologist: Phil Turner, who specializes in making some of Mr. Kundig’s more audacious ideas reality.
But even a studio railroad initially seemed like the stuff of dreams. “I just said, offhand, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if you could just take that office, that studio, and put it on tracks,’” recalled Mr. Kundig, describing the meeting where he listened to Mr. Maxon explain his desire for a home office that could provide isolation. “It was a joke.”
But the more they batted the idea around, the more appealing it seemed — and the more daunting. “It’s a really simple idea, but requires all sorts of craziness to get there,” Mr. Kundig said. “It’s one thing to draw it, but it’s another thing to deliver it.”
In other words, he said, “I didn’t know how to pull something like this off.”

Mr. Maxon first met Mr. Kundig in 2008, shortly after he and his wife, Kim Maxon, 52, bought their 21.5-acre lot outside Seattle for around $328,000, with the idea of building a modernist home they could share with their children, Henry, now 23, Jack, 20, and Charlie, 16. Ms. Maxon gave her husband a book about Mr. Kundig’s work as a Christmas gift and, flipping through its pages, they decided he was the architect for the job.
The process of designing and building the house took longer than they expected because of challenges with the steep site and the intricacies of obtaining a construction loan following the financial crisis. When the house was finally completed in 2016, Mr. Maxon dove head first into the design and construction of his rolling studio.
Naturally curious and keen to prove that the idea could be realized, Mr. Maxon decided he wouldn’t just be the conductor of the finished structure — he would also be the general contractor and personally work through the details, find the necessary materials and parts, and orchestrate the construction.
“Between 2016 and 2018, it was a lot of research,” he said. “I approached the studio like I would any project.” He read about railroads that used to run through the area, befriended workers at a nearby rail yard and spent vacations riding the rails.

“I went crazy for trains,” he said. “I found myself, on a Sunday afternoon, at a train show. We took the Empire Builder, which was the original Great Northern, from Seattle to Chicago and back. I went on a trip to Japan with my son, and we went on trains.”
To build his own railroad, Mr. Maxon sourced reclaimed rails from Harmer Steel that were once used by the Great Northern Railway. To ensure that the rails remained flat and straight, excavators dug deep into the earth along the desired route and filled the void with 27 dump-truck loads of stone track ballast.
To construct the studio building, Mr. Maxon worked with Alpine Welding and Equipment, a frequent Olson Kundig collaborator.
Such an unconventional project was “tantalizing to people like us,” said Tim Odell, the owner of the company, who not only did the steelwork but also helped Mr. Maxon assemble the systems that would make the studio move, working with his employee Jesse Thomson. “When you start talking about a project where we can do something that’s kinetic, we get really excited.”

Alpine prefabricated most of the structure in sections before craning and connecting the pieces on the rails. Inside, the studio is finished in more steel, plywood and exposed electrical conduit. The first floor has a desk and serves as Mr. Maxon’s primary work space. The second floor, reached by a ladder, is his library.
The 35,000-pound structure sits on custom-made wheels emblazoned with Mr. Maxon’s professional logo and is powered by an electric engine connected to a retracting wire hidden behind one of the rails. For the controls, Mr. Maxon found a vintage General Motors Electro-Motive Division control panel from South Korea on eBay, after one of his rail yard friends told him what to look for.
One of the levers on the control panel sets the direction and another adjusts the throttle, but there was one lever left over, Mr. Maxon said: “We didn’t need the dynamic brake function.”
Soon, however, he realized that it would be difficult to climb up to his library while carrying books or a laptop. So Mr. Odell and Mr. Thomson devised a dumbwaiter powered by a small conveyer-belt motor, which they installed beside the ladder and wired to that extra lever.

The rolling building was completed in November 2022, at a total cost of about $375,000, including the structure and the railroad.
The first time Ms. Maxon saw the studio move, she could barely believe her eyes. “I’m not the visionary in the family — that’s Lou. So I was a little apprehensive before it got built, because I couldn’t picture it,” she said. “But the first time they ran it down the tracks, I was just flabbergasted and in awe.”
Although Mr. Maxon has finished building his personal railroad, his new passion seems to have stuck. This summer, he said, “we fly to London to see our son, but then we’re taking the train up to Edinburgh.” Next year, he and Ms. Maxon are planning a similar train trip in Japan. Professionally, he has also started working on a few railway museum projects.
“I’m just part of the railroad community now,” he said, noting that he has filled his studio with related memorabilia, including a model train, a vintage first-aid kit and a Great Northern Railway sign. “In addition to being a studio, it’s a bit of a mini moving monument to the railroads.”

2023-04-21,"Lyft, which has struggled financially while trying to compete with its rival, Uber, said on Friday that it was planning major job cuts.
The layoffs, which are expected next week, will affect about 1,200 people, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. It is the first significant move by David Risher, the company’s new chief executive. Mr. Risher had been considering the cuts for several weeks, the person said, even though his first official day as the company’s C.E.O. was on Monday.
“We need to bring our costs down to deliver affordable rides, compelling earnings for drivers and profitable growth,” Mr. Risher said in a note to employees. He added that money saved from the downsizing would be used to “invest in competitive pricing, faster pick-up times and better driver earnings.”
Mr. Risher said that employees would be notified next Thursday if they had lost their jobs, and that Lyft offices would be closed that day.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
News of the job cuts at Lyft, which has about 4,000 employees, was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
“This is a hard decision, and one we’re not making lightly,” Sona Iliffe-Moon, a Lyft spokeswoman, said in a statement. “But the result will be a far stronger, more competitive Lyft.”
Lyft announced in March that Mr. Risher, a former Amazon and Microsoft executive who served on Lyft’s board, would take over for John Zimmer and Logan Green, the company’s founders. Both men are leaving their executive positions but staying at the company as members of the board.
Lyft has long been a distant second to Uber, which has emerged from the pandemic in a stronger position, partly because of its investment in food delivery and a global ride-hailing business.
In November, Lyft laid off 13 percent of its staff. In February, the company reported record revenue but warned it would be slowed by economic challenges as it worked to lower prices. Mr. Risher has said that keeping prices competitive will be a key part of his strategy to differentiate Lyft from Uber.

Lyft employees had been anticipating layoffs for months. Business consultants had been brought in to ask departments to justify their budgets and make cost-cutting recommendations, three current and former employees said, and company executives had been hinting throughout the spring that more workers could lose their jobs.
Employees expected the layoffs to come by mid-April, before managers were scheduled to write yearly performance reviews and executives had to decide on compensation for the year."

2023-04-24,"LOS ANGELES — Jorge Mendez waited impatiently as the Los Angeles Kings’ fate hung in the balance late Friday night.
Their N.H.L. first-round playoff game against the Edmonton Oilers had already gone into overtime, robbing Mendez’s crew of several precious minutes they would need to get Crypto.com Arena ready for the Clippers’ N.B.A. playoff game on Saturday afternoon. And now there was another delay. Officials were trying to determine whether a would-be game-winning goal by Kings forward Trevor Moore should count.
Mendez, the venue’s assistant conversion manager, had a crew of about 20 people waiting to transform the chilly arena. They would be working all night and had to finish by 7 a.m. Saturday. They had never missed a deadline, and weren’t about to start now.
“With the referees we don’t know,” Mendez said. “They could say they deny that one and it goes longer. And the more longer they go, they’re going to take more time from me.”

The Kings had a playoff game Friday night, and the Clippers and Lakers hosted postseason games Saturday, creating an eventful weekend for arena workers.
The goal stood and the Kings won. Fans celebrated and left the building, then Mendez’s crew got to work: The nets and glass surrounding the ice rink came down; the penalty boxes and benches were disassembled and moved; the ice was cleaned and covered by insulation so it wouldn’t melt during the next day’s basketball games; and the modules containing seats were shifted into new configurations.
They finished well before 7 a.m. and Mendez drove home at 6:30 a.m. At that time of day there is little traffic, so it took him just 10 minutes. When he works overnight, he sleeps during the day, and his wife tries to stop his 9-year-old daughter from bursting into his room to ask if he wants to bike with her. But Mendez’s weekend was long from over.
Like dozens of others, Mendez worked tirelessly to make sure the arena could handle its frenetic week. The busiest time came in the 36 hours after the Kings game Friday, when the building turned over from the Kings to the Clippers to the Lakers and back to the Kings. All three teams have called the arena home since 1999, when it opened as Staples Center.
“My favorite part of this is when they’re done,” said Lee Zeidman, the president of Crypto.com Arena; the nearby Microsoft Theater; and the surrounding entertainment district, L.A. Live. “It’s like a puzzle. These men and women they’re the best in the business.”

“It’s chaos,” said Darryl Jackson, an event operations assistant manager for the arena. “But it’s organized. Organized chaos.” He began his career working on conversions, but now helps to make sure the baskets during basketball games and the glass during hockey games stay in good condition.
Minutes after Game 4 of the first-round series between the Clippers and the Phoenix Suns finished Saturday, Loreto Verdugo backed a forklift down an aisle between the court and the first row of grandstand seats. He had just a couple of inches of space on either side of him. After years of doing this task, he wasn’t nearly as nervous as he was the first time he did it.
“You don’t want to hit the floor because the floor’s the most important thing out there,” Verdugo said. “But you don’t want to hit anybody else either.”
He had quietly left his home in North Hollywood at 4 a.m. (“I’m like a mouse,” he said) to be at the arena in time to begin supervising maintenance work.
As soon as the Clippers’ game ended, just before 3 p.m., and all of the people had been cleared from the court, a bustle of expertly choreographed activity began. By the time the Clippers’ players began their postgame interviews, workers had bagged fans’ trash, and the player and logo banners the Clippers hang in the rafters had been rolled up to reveal the gold-colored championship banners for the Lakers and the W.N.B.A.’s Los Angeles Sparks, who have also shared the arena for much of the past two decades.

The Kings won in overtime Friday against the Edmonton Oilers before the Clippers lost to the Phoenix Suns and the Lakers beat the Memphis Grizzlies.
The Clippers’ court was already being uprooted from the floor, piece by interlocking piece, and loaded onto pallets that Verdugo and two other forklift drivers would pick up and deposit in a storage area that doubles as a news conference room.
It was the 251st midday conversion in the history of Crypto.com Arena.
About an hour after the Clippers’ game ended, their court had been replaced by the Lakers’ floor.
Joe Keeler, who normally drives the Zamboni that cleans and builds the ice during hockey games, joined a group of people folding the baskets with white stanchions that the Clippers use and rolling them out to the storage area. They replaced them with the yellow-stanchioned baskets the Lakers use.
“Everybody helps where they can,” said Keeler, who also helped pick up the Clippers’ floor and lay down the Lakers’.

Red Clippers drapery was replaced by purple, and a purple carpet had been rolled out in the tunnel the Lakers use to go onto the court.
It is a little easier when the conversion is from one basketball court to another. Doubleheaders involving the Kings are more challenging. When the building first opened, Zeidman gathered the vendors for the basketball courts, the seats and the plexiglass for hockey games and asked them how long they thought it would take to convert the hockey arena into a basketball arena. They told him at least four hours.
“Unacceptable,” Zeidman said.

Robbin Dedeaux, a seasoned usher, worked his section during the Clippers’ game before the changeover. The court and banners, like the Lakers and Sparks’ championship banners, are adjusted accordingly.
‘How can I work here?’
The first conversion for a doubleheader was an event in itself. Fans were allowed to watch from a designated area. Arena workers watched from a break room upstairs.

“It was amazing,” said Juanita Williams, 57, an usher who has worked right behind the home benches during basketball games since the building opened. “To see it for the first time, we were like there’s no way they’re going to change this over in two and a half hours. It happened.”
Williams started as an usher 25 years ago at the Forum in Inglewood, Calif., where the Lakers and the Kings played from 1967 to 1999. She called to find out how much Lakers season tickets cost.
“I said: ‘OK, I cannot afford those tickets. So how can I work here then?’” she said.
In the daytime she works from home as a buyer for a washer and dryer company that she has been with for 34 years. Her daughter briefly took a job as an usher, too, while going to cosmetology school.
By Monday night, Williams will have worked in all six playoff games since Thursday.
The merchandise available on arena concourses must be refreshed, too.

Robbin Dedeaux, 65, will have too. He works at the top of the lower bowl in aisle 14, checking tickets and greeting customers. He is stationed right next to where the Lakers’ radio broadcasters sit.
Dedeaux also started this work as a second job to get out of the list of chores his wife, Ricca Dedeaux, was always asking him to do. He started with ticket-taking in 1999 and then became an usher. He has been asked if he’d like to work down on the floor, but he thinks he might get sleepy if he got to sit down.
“The fans are the best part of the job,” Dedeaux said. “You get to see them from all over the world. They come in from Italy, they come in from France, they come in from Germany. You have fun with them.”
He added: “When the fans that come here from different arenas, I have fun with them. I tell them to get out.”
He laughed.
Dedeaux and his wife have been married for 40 years. He said she misses him during basketball and hockey season when he is working so many hours.

After the Lakers game, Darryl Jackson and his crew convert the arena back into an NHL venue.
‘It has to be done’
Ignacio Guerra’s first job in the events world came in the early 1990s. He was a high school chemistry and biology teacher and coach, and he would park cars at the Hollywood Bowl in the summers. When Staples Center opened, Guerra worked for the contractor parking cars there, before finding a job working for the arena. Saturday was his 21st anniversary with the arena.

In 2019, he took over as the head of the arena’s operations department. He is now the senior vice president of operations and engineering. He has worked hundreds of events and has two large frames in his office displaying credentials for everything from Taylor Swift concerts to N.B.A. All-Star Games.
He shepherded the building through coronavirus shutdowns and the return of fans. During the shutdown, many of his workers took other jobs and didn’t come back, which meant starting over with new people at some positions.
Kings and Lakers fans celebrated victories while the Clippers fell further behind in their playoff series.
At least a handful of the remaining people have worked at the arena since the beginning, including the man who builds the penalty boxes for hockey games. Guerra often stands in the middle of the floor supervising all of the activity.
“They’re the heart and soul of this,” Guerra said of the operations staff.
He said the crew has never missed a conversion.

“You can’t wait up at 7 in the morning and say, ‘Hey, sorry we couldn’t get the Laker floor down.’” Guerra said. “It has to be down, and there’s a no-fail mentality.”

2023-04-25,"Microsoft’s cloud computing business drove a surprisingly strong quarter despite pressure from the slowing U.S. economy, the company said on Tuesday.
Revenue in the first three months of the year was up 7 percent from a year earlier to $52.9 billion, and profit was up 9 percent to $18.3 billion. Both exceeded Wall Street expectations.
Microsoft’s cloud business — which includes Azure, its cloud computing product, and its Microsoft 365 platform — had $28.5 billion in revenue, up 22 percent from a year earlier.
Sales of Azure, a key result watched by investors, grew 27 percent, which was in line with investors’ expectations. Still, that was a drop from a 46 percent increase the year before. Overall, the segment that the company calls Intelligent Cloud was up 16 percent from a year earlier, which was better than had been expected.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Microsoft’s cloud products are “certainly a very important engine for us going forward,” said James Ambrose, Microsoft’s director of investor relations.
Shares of Microsoft stock jumped more than 8 percent in after-hours trading.
Microsoft, like many other technology companies, has been hindered by the sluggish economy after substantial growth during the pandemic. The company said in January that it would lay off 10,000 employees.
The company’s Windows business has slumped as the global market for personal computer sales has slowed. Revenue from Microsoft’s personal computing segment in its most recent quarter was $13.3 billion, a 9 percent decrease from a year earlier. Within that category, revenue from Windows OEM — original installations of Windows software on new computers — sank 28 percent, and devices revenue was down 30 percent.
Revenue from Microsoft’s video game segment, its most important consumer business, was down 4 percent from a year earlier, as Xbox hardware sales fell 30 percent.
Still, Microsoft’s stock has remained strong, buoyed in part by the company’s foray into the booming field of artificial intelligence.

Mr. Ambrose cautioned that the strong numbers did not necessarily suggest an improving macroeconomic environment. “I don’t know that it signals a major change in our view” of the economy, he said.
Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said on a call with investors that sales growth in the current quarter could be flat compared with unusually strong quarter a year ago.
Microsoft is also poised to benefit from the boom in A.I. through its investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind the ChatGPT chatbot. It has already integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and the company has said it will incorporate A.I. into other Microsoft products as well.
Though the company said it was too early for the futuristic technology to affect its quarterly financial figures, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, said “A.I.” or “OpenAI” at least 24 times in his 15-minute introduction on the call with investors.
“We have the most powerful A.I. infrastructure,” Mr. Nadella said at one point, mentioning a variety of companies already using Microsoft’s A.I. tools in their businesses. To support high demand for its A.I. products, the company said, it will spend to scale up that infrastructure."

South Korea’s nuclear deal
The U.S. has agreed to give South Korea a central role in the strategic planning for the use of nuclear weapons in any conflict with North Korea. In return, South Korea agreed to not pursue its own nuclear arsenal.
The deal, announced during President Yoon Suk Yeol’s state visit to Washington, is meant to assure South Korea that the U.S. will use its nuclear arsenal, if needed, to dissuade or respond to a nuclear attack from the North — even if that risks a strike on an American city. The concept is called “extended deterrence.”
The accord is an admission that disarming North Korea is no longer plausible. In the past four years, the North’s arsenal has grown so fast that U.S. and South Korean officials have stopped trying to keep a precise count.

Xi speaks with Zelensky
Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, had long requested a conversation with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Yesterday, the two spoke by phone — their first known contact since Russia’s invasion.
Both framed the call carefully. China’s official account notably omitted the words “Russia” and “war,” and referred instead to the need for a “political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.” Zelensky said the discussion was “long and meaningful.”
Despite Xi’s conversation with Zelensky, China and Russia remain closely aligned: Last month, Xi met with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and the two also spoke little of the war, though China has floated a potential peace plan.
Xi has also been trying to burnish his image as a global statesman by helping to restore ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and by welcoming President Emmanuel Macron of France to China.

Indian girls’ cricket dreams
This spring, a new professional cricket league for women in India held its inaugural season — a $500 million bet on female talent in the country’s most popular sport.
The Women’s Premier League is already creating new opportunities for female athletes, as seen in one village in Punjab, where a team of girls ranging in age from 9 to 14 dream of becoming professional cricketers.
Their coach takes them to see games far away. He pours his salary into their team and brings recruiters to watch them play. He builds their confidence, encouraging them to see cricket as an escape from the confines of Indian village life, where women perform most of the domestic labor.
“This is what it looks like to chip away at India’s rigid gender divide,” writes Mujib Mashal, our South Asia bureau chief.

2023-04-27,"For much of its history, Amazon grew amazingly, unbelievably fast. Not so much anymore.
Amazon released on Thursday its results for the first quarter. Revenue increased 9 percent, the same as in the previous quarter.
While slow by historical standards, when sales could pop 40 percent from the previous year, the numbers looked pretty good to analysts who expected even less. Amazon shares, which have had a lousy 18 months, rose more than 10 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday before giving up those gains as reality settled in.
Revenue rose to $127.4 billion, while net income jumped to 31 cents a share against a loss of 38 cents in 2022. Analysts had expected a profit of 21 cents a share and revenue of $124.55 billion.
“From my perspective, I think there’s a fair bit to like about how our teams are delivering for customers and the results we’re starting to see,” Amazon’s chief executive, Andy Jassy, said in a call with analysts.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Best-performing sectors were advertising, which rose 21 percent, and Amazon Web Services, which rose 16 percent. But revenue at the online stores, which for most consumers is the essence of Amazon, fell by about $33 million.
Mr. Jassy spoke at length about how all of Amazon will be invigorated in the next few years by artificial intelligence — like large language models and the generative A.I. that they power.
“Frankly the models were not that compelling before about six, nine months ago,” he said. “They have gotten so much bigger and so much better, much more quickly. It really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists, and many that don’t exist.”
Amazon, like other tech companies, did very well early in the pandemic when everyone stayed home but has had some troubles since. After expanding its retail distribution network to handle an influx of new business that did not stick around, management is paring back.
Employment at the company has shrunk 10 percent since its peak in early 2022, or by 150,000 workers. Since November, the company has confirmed 27,000 layoffs in divisions including human resources, retail and cloud computing. But the warehouses and distribution network have dropped the most.

Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, did not rule out more layoffs in a call with reporters on Thursday. “We’ll proceed adaptively,” he said.
Amazon’s Big Tech peers reported surprisingly good results this week after a brutal winter of layoffs, weak results and diminished expectations. Facebook’s parent, Meta, snapped a three-quarter losing streak in revenue, sending its shares up 10 percent. Google’s advertising search business did better than expected, while Microsoft’s cloud computing operation helped the company notch impressive results.
For years, even decades, Amazon chose growth over profits. Making money took a back seat to establishing new markets. Sometimes this worked so well it changed the fundamental nature of the company. AWS grew at such a torrid rate that its profits have done much to compensate for Amazon’s anemic returns on the retail side.
On the other hand, many small ventures remained small. When to shut them down is a decision that for years Amazon could put off, but no longer. Rising interest rates and balky consumers forced its hand.
This week, the company shut its Halo line of health and fitness devices. Amazon has major ambitions in health care, but fitness devices are a crowded market and Halo was not breaking through. Amazon also shut down in recent days Book Depository, an online bookseller it bought in 2011 and operated independently from its principal book-selling division.

New horizons beckon.
“Health care is a multitrillion-dollar business that is very segmented and it’s really broken, in the U.S. particularly,” Mr. Jassy said."

First Republic Bank in San Francisco.

Jason Henry for The New York Times
First Republic barely hangs on
First Republic is limping into the weekend, days after reporting disastrous first-quarter results. The bank is still working on a lifeline, with some involved saying it is touch and go whether the federal government will assist in some way, DealBook hears.
The precariousness of First Republic is a reminder that the banking crisis that erupted last month isn’t over yet and that a disorderly collapse of the lender could unleash yet more chaos in financial markets.
Time may be running out. Shares in First Republic are up nearly 10 percent in premarket trading, after having jumped yesterday, presumably in hopes that a rescue will emerge. But the bank’s stock is still at about $6, a far cry from the $150 it traded at a year ago.
A fundamental question is still hovering: Will the government force big banks into a rescue deal — which could involve those firms buying First Republic’s loans above market prices but below book value — or seize the troubled lender outright?
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Which way the government will go remains uncertain. While officials in Washington are holding “urgent” discussions with potential rescuers, according to Reuters, it’s not clear how much aid the Biden administration will provide.
Closing First Republic would raise more issues. There’s the matter of the bank’s uninsured deposits, including the $30 billion that big banks had already injected as part of an earlier lifeline. (Remember that the F.D.I.C. insures deposits only up to $250,000 each, and many of First Republic’s deposits are well above that.)
It could also disrupt lending, including to the already embattled commercial real estate industry: Landlords are on the hook to refinance $137 billion of office mortgages this year, and nearly half a trillion dollars in the next four years.
New volatility could weigh on the Fed ahead of a crucial meeting next week on interest rate policy. Economists expect the central bank to raise rates by 25 basis points, but fresh strains on the nation’s banks may alter officials’ calculus.
In other banking news: The Fed is expected to issue its long-awaited autopsy on Silicon Valley Bank at 11 a.m Eastern; bank watchers want to know how government officials missed warning signs at the failed lender. The F.D.I.C. will also release a post-mortem on Signature Bank’s collapse.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The eurozone narrowly avoids a recession. G.D.P. for the 20 nations using the euro rose last quarter by 0.1 percent, below most forecasts; lagging consumer demand in Germany was a major factor.
Oil giants continue to profit. ExxonMobil and Chevron reported profits on Friday that solidly beat analysts’ expectations, even as crude prices fell from last year’s heights.
Federal authorities move on a former FTX executive. The F.B.I. on Thursday searched the Maryland home of Ryan Salame, a longtime lieutenant to the collapsed crypto exchange’s chief, Sam Bankman-Fried. It’s unclear what investigators were seeking, but officials have scrutinized Salame and others over political donations reportedly made with FTX customer money.

Amazon beat analyst expectations for revenue and profit on Thursday, thanks to strong international sales and an uptick for its advertising business, even as companies and consumers globally are tightening their budgets.

Amazon also talked up artificial intelligence. Andy Jassy, its C.E.O., said that large-language models and generative A.I. would help transform its cloud business and “virtually every customer experience that exists, and many that don’t exist.” That follows efforts this week by Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Facebook’s parent company, to give investors bullish visions of A.I.’s promise for their businesses.
Shareholders like what they’re hearing from tech giants. The Nasdaq 100, a collection of big-cap tech companies, rallied again on Thursday and is up more than 20 percent in 2023. So far this year, shares in Meta have nearly doubled in price, while those in Amazon and Apple are up about 30 percent.

Many of these businesses had been hurt by a slowing economy and rising interest rates, but their “year of efficiency” focus on cost-cutting, including via layoffs, appears to be paying off with investors.
But other tech companies, especially smaller ones, aren’t faring so well:
Snap reported its first sales decline as a public company, sending its stock down more than 18 percent in premarket trading. There’s a bright side for the parent company of Snapchat: User numbers grew and it lost less money than expected.
The ride-hailing company Lyft, the storage provider Dropbox and the audio chat start-up Clubhouse all announced layoffs.
And Intel reported its fifth consecutive quarter of declining sales and its biggest-ever quarterly loss. Like Samsung, the chip maker has seen global demand for semiconductors evaporate.
Carbon tech captures Washington
New rules for curtailing power plant emissions, expected from the Environmental Protection Agency next month, could help pave the way for one of the buzziest areas of clean-tech investing: carbon capture.
Despite its many critics, carbon capture (the practice of sucking carbon dioxide out of the air) has drawn a flock of investors, including Bill Gates and Elon Musk. It has also become a centerpiece for Big Oil’s decarbonization strategy — which has drawn plenty of skeptics — while uniting lawmakers on the right and left who see it as an attractive policy choice.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Big Energy is bullish on carbon capture. The oil and gas industry spent more than $124 million on federal lobbying in 2022, according to the watchdog group OpenSecrets, with a big area of focus being subsidies for carbon capture. And though none of the nation’s coal- and gas-fired power plants currently use the technology in a significant way, the five biggest spenders have been spotlighting their carbon capture investments recently:
Occidental Petroleum is building out a $1 billion direct air capture and carbon storage project in Texas.
In November, Exxon Mobil partnered with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on carbon capture for industrial customers.
Chevron has made various investments in carbon capture projects.
Carbon capture has an expanding place in policy. Lawmakers in the Senate and House recently introduced bipartisan legislation to encourage carbon reuse once it’s captured from high-emission products like aviation fuel and construction materials. Last year’s Inflation Reduction Act significantly increased the tax credit for capturing carbon and the Department of Energy plans to award $3.5 billion to plants for direct air capture, spurring investor interest in the sector.
But the new rules could face resistance. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down emissions rules proposed by the E.P.A. under the Obama administration, finding that climate change was a “major question” to be addressed by Congress, not by unelected regulators.
The new regulations have been crafted with that decision in mind but are still likely to face pushback. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment on the rules while they are under review, telling DealBook, “We have been clear from the start that we will use all of our legally-upheld tools, grounded in decades-old bipartisan laws, to address dangerous air pollution.”
Is America ceding control of its own companies?
Britain’s blocking of Microsoft’s takeover of Activision Blizzard helped cement the country as a formidable force on the global antitrust stage. But given the Federal Trade Commission’s already public opposition to the $69 billion transaction — and the growing global alignment on competition policy — some are questioning whether and how much American and British regulators coordinated their approaches to the deal.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Among them are Jay Clayton, a former S.E.C. chairman, and Gary Cohn, a former Trump economic adviser and onetime Goldman Sachs president. In a Times Opinion guest essay, the two argued that Britain’s move threatens America’s ability to regulate its own businesses:
If these were isolated examples of abdication of regulatory authority to Europe, we might shrug it off. They are not. Our regulators are all too often deferring to foreign counterparts, citing euphemisms like “international cooperation” and “global regulatory harmonization” while paying short shrift to their obligation to consider domestic consequences in accordance with our laws.
The Europeans are our allies, but they also are our competitors. Shouldn’t we expect European regulation of U.S. matters to favor European interests over the interests of U.S. citizens? What will U.S. regulators say in the future when European regulators, citing the Microsoft and Illumina examples, assert jurisdiction over a U.S.-centric transaction where U.S. and European interests are at odds? What if Chinese regulators make similar assertions?

JPMorgan Chase went from advising First Republic to buying it.

Jim Wilson/The New York Times
Goodbye, First Republic; hello again, JPMorgan
First Republic is no more: Regulators seized the embattled lender overnight and sold it to JPMorgan Chase. What is now America’s second-biggest bank failure, after the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual, means that 84 bank branches that closed as First Republic locations on Friday will reopen on Monday as Chase branches.
The deal caps a flurry of negotiations in recent days to resolve the fate of First Republic, which failed to recover from the turmoil set off by Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse in March. Regulators and banking executives hope that the sale will bring an end to the regional banking crisis.
JPMorgan prevailed in an auction that ran over the weekend, beating out other contenders including PNC Financial Services. As part of the deal, JPMorgan will assume the majority of First Republic’s assets, including $173 billion in loans and $30 billion in securities, as well as $92 billion in deposits.
That will spare the F.D.I.C. from a bigger rescue bill: It doesn’t need to worry about having to cover First Republic’s roughly $50 billion in uninsured deposits, since they will move over to JPMorgan. (The F.D.I.C. still estimates its insurance fund will take a $13 billion hit, and the agency reached a loss-sharing agreement with JPMorgan on some loans.)
The auction is another twist in the First Republic story. JPMorgan initially was an adviser to the troubled lender, with its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, helping convince his counterparts at other big banks to deposit $30 billion at First Republic in March as a lifeline.
But the plan failed to stabilize the lender, which announced last week that it had lost $100 billion in deposits during the first quarter. The news battered First Republic’s shares, with its market value falling to just $650 million on Friday, down from $20 billion before March, setting the stage for its sale.

Uber said on Tuesday that its revenue grew 29 percent in its most recent quarter as the company benefited from a series of investments in new services, as well as the continued return of drivers to its ride-hailing business.
The company said it had $8.8 billion in revenue, roughly in line with investors’ expectations. Uber had $31.4 billion in gross bookings — the amount of money paid by customers — a 19 percent jump from a year ago.
Uber said it remained on track to generate a quarterly profit from the strength of its business operations sometime this year — a milestone on the road to overall profitability.
“With our global scale and deeper local density, we are increasingly separating from smaller regional competitors both on driver preference and on the breadth of mobility products we offer consumers,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, said in a statement.
Shares of Uber stock ended the day nearly 12 percent higher after the company reported other figures that beat investor expectations.

The company has since avoided the mass layoffs that have taken place at other tech companies, though it said on Tuesday that its overall head count was down after cuts at Drizly, an alcohol delivery platform owned by Uber, and in its freight business.
Uber said its U.S. and Canadian ride-hailing businesses, which had been slow to recover from the pandemic, were now growing faster, with trips in those regions up 40 percent from a year ago. The company said lower fares had helped with that growth. Uber invested heavily in financial incentives to get drivers back on its platform. Now drivers’ earnings are also increasing, the company said.
Background: Uber focused on incentives for drivers.
Uber’s main competitor, Lyft, did not invest as heavily on getting drivers back to its platform after pandemic lockdowns. With fewer drivers on the road, its prices have gone up.
Uber also has more products than Lyft, including partnerships with taxis and a shared-ride business. Bookings from products beyond its flagship UberX ride business grew more than 100 percent from a year earlier, the company said.
The company said it was confident about its rivalry with Lyft.
“They’re looking to price competitively with us, and we think that sets up a competitive environment where we’re competing on brand,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said on a call with investors.
Uber’s delivery business grew far more slowly than ride hailing but still managed 8 percent growth in bookings from a year ago. Its freight business shrank 23 percent, which the company attributed to the challenging economy.
Overall, Uber lost $157 million, cushioned by gains in its investments in other companies.
What’s Next: Lyft reports its quarterly results.
Lyft, which has undergone layoffs and leadership changes, will report its own financial results on Thursday. The company just cut 26 percent of employees and named a new chief executive."
2023-05-03,"The Federal Trade Commission escalated its fight with the tech industry’s biggest companies on Wednesday as it moved to impose what it called a “blanket prohibition” on the collection of young people’s personal data by Meta, Facebook’s parent company.
The commission wants to significantly expand a record $5 billion consent order with the company from 2020 and said that Meta had failed to fully meet the legal commitments it made to overhaul its privacy practices to better protect its users.
Regulators also said Meta had misled parents about their ability to control whom their children communicated with on its Messenger Kids app and misrepresented the access it gave some app developers to users’ private data.
The proposed changes mark the third time the agency has taken action against the social media giant over privacy issues.

“The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk,” Samuel Levine, the director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a press statement. “Facebook needs to answer for its failures.”
The F.T.C.’s administrative action, an internal agency procedure called an “order to show cause,” serves as a preliminary warning to Meta that regulators believe the company violated the 2020 privacy agreement. The document lays out the commission’s accusations against Meta as well its proposed restrictions.
Meta, which has 30 days to challenge the filing, was not given advance notice of the action by the F.T.C.

After Facebook responds, the commission said it will consider the company’s arguments and make a decision. Meta could then appeal the agency’s decision in a federal court of appeals.

The F.T.C.’s proposed changes would bar Meta from profiting from the data it collects from users under the age of 18, and would apply to Meta businesses including Facebook, Instagram and Horizon Worlds, the company’s new virtual reality platform. Regulators want to bar the company from monetizing on that data even after those users turn 18.
That means Meta could be prohibited from using details about young people’s activities to show them ads based on their behavior or market digital items to them, like virtual clothes for their avatars.
Whether a court would approve such changes is unknown. In a statement on Wednesday, Alvaro M. Bedoya, a commissioner who voted to issue the administrative order, said he had concerns about whether the agency’s proposal to restrict Meta’s use of young people’s data was sufficiently relevant to the original case.
In a statement, Meta called the F.T.C.’s administrative warning “a political stunt” and said the company had introduced an “industry-leading” privacy program under the agreement with the F.T.C. The company vowed to fight the agency’s action.
“Despite three years of continual engagement with the F.T.C. around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,” Meta said in a statement.

Meta had already announced limits on targeting ads to users under 18. In 2021, the company said advertisers would be able to customize ads based on minors’ locations, ages and genders but would no longer be able to target ads based on young people’s interests or activities on other websites. And this year, Meta said it would also stop ad-targeting based on minors’ gender.
The F.T.C.’s aggressive action is the first time that the commission has proposed such a blanket ban on the use of data to try to protect the online privacy of minors. And it arrives amid the most sweeping government drive to insulate young Americans online since the 1990s, when the commercial internet was still in its infancy.
Fueled by mounting concerns about depression among children and the role that online experiences could play in exacerbating it, lawmakers in at least two dozen states over the past year have introduced bills that would require certain sites, like social networks, to bar or limit young people on their platforms. Regulators are also intensifying their efforts, imposing fines on online services whose use or misuse of data could expose children to risks.
Over the past few years, critics have faulted Meta for recommending content on self-harm and extreme dieting to teenage girls on Instagram as well as failing to sufficiently protect young users from child sexual exploitation.
The F.T.C.’s case against the social media giant dates back more than a decade.
In 2011, the agency accused Facebook of deceiving users on privacy. In a settlement, Facebook agreed to implement a comprehensive privacy program, including agreeing not to misrepresent its privacy practices.

But after news reports in 2018 that a voter-profiling company, Cambridge Analytica, had harvested the data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge, the F.T.C. cracked down again.
In a consent order finalized in 2020, Facebook agreed to restructure its privacy procedures and practices, and allow an independent assessor to examine the effectiveness of the company’s privacy program. The company also paid a record $5 billion fine to settle the agency’s charges.
The F.T.C. says Facebook has violated that agreement. In its administrative order on Wednesday, the agency cited reports from the privacy assessor, noting it had found “gaps and weaknesses” in Meta’s privacy program that required substantial additional work.
Although much of the report was redacted, it indicated that the assessor found issues with the way Meta assessed privacy risks to users’ data and managed privacy incidents. It also cited Meta’s oversight of its data-sharing arrangements with third parties.
The F.T.C.’s crackdown on Meta is the latest signal that the agency is following through on pledges by Lina M. Khan, ‌‌its chair, to rein in the power of the tech industry’s dominant companies. In December, the agency moved to halt consolidation among video game makers when it filed a lawsuit to try to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company behind the popular Call of Duty franchise.

The F.T.C. has also become more aggressive about privacy regulation. Rather than simply trying to protect consumers from increasingly powerful surveillance tools, regulators are working to prohibit certain kinds of data collection and usages that they consider high-risk.

The F.T.C. in December accused Epic Games, the company behind the popular Fornite game, of illegally collecting children’s data and of putting them at risk by matching them with strangers and enabling live chat. Epic agreed to pay a $520 million fine to settle those and other charges. The settlement order also required Epic to turn off live voice and text chat by default — the first time regulators had imposed such a remedy.
But the data restrictions the agency now wants to impose on Meta go much further.
The F.T.C.’s proposed changes would bar Meta-owned sites and products from monetizing young people’s data. That would allow company platforms like Horizon Worlds to collect and use minors’ information only to provide services to users and for security purposes.
The F.T.C. also wants to bar Meta from releasing any new products or features until the company can demonstrate, through written confirmation from an independent privacy assessor, that its privacy program fully complies with the 2020 consent order."

Regional bank stocks are sinking in premarket trading.

PacWest plunges as banking woes spread
The regional banking sector is teetering again, with PacWest’s stock plummeting more than 35 percent in premarket trading, despite the Fed chair Jay Powell’s assessment that the worst is over.
The Los Angeles-based lender confirmed that it was talking to potential investors following reports that it was exploring a sale. Investors may be feeling some déjà vu after witnessing two big bank failures, and billions in market value wiped out, since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March.
It’s not just PacWest in free-fall. Shares in Western Alliance, Comerica and Zions Bancorp were down sharply too, even as S&P 500 futures were down only slightly after the Fed signaled it may be done raising interest rates.
News of a potential PacWest sale, first reported by Bloomberg — and confirmed by DealBook — came just hours after Mr. Powell declared that the banking system was “sound and resilient.”

Despite Mr. Powell’s reassurances, big questions remain. Among them: Can regional banks like PacWest find a private-sector solution? Or will regulators again need to step in?
The fix is tricky, as was made clear by First Republic’s monthlong search for a rescuer. JPMorgan Chase bought the lender only after it had been seized by the F.D.I.C. PacWest appears healthy, with deposits — 75 percent of which are insured — ticking up since the end of March. But it needs to raise capital, and fast.
Selling its depressed stock would be costly for PacWest. That could further spook depositors and investors, and play into the hands of the short sellers targeting the sector. Meanwhile, a fire sale of assets, including loans (the bank’s $2.7 billion lender finance loan portfolio is on the block) and securities pegged at low interest rates, may not fetch much. Finally, selling itself could be tough, and not only because the pool of potential buyers has narrowed significantly since the JPMorgan-First Republic deal.
Criticism of the Fed and calls for regulatory action are growing. Mohamed El-Erian, an economist and an adviser at Allianz, accused Powell of confusing the markets by saying the sector’s problems had largely been contained with the sale of First Republic. And Bill Ackman, the billionaire investor, called on regulators to modernize the deposit insurance system to restore the public’s faith in regional lenders. (He added that his hedge fund was neither long nor short the banking sector.)

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Oil prices whipsaw in volatile trading. Benchmarks for crude rose on Thursday, but not enough to compensate for yesterday’s plunge, which was driven by investor concerns about slowing global demand. Meanwhile, Shell reported better-than-expected earnings, as lower costs and strong trading results offset lower oil and gas prices.
Jamie Dimon reportedly may testify about Jeffrey Epstein later this month. A deposition of JPMorgan Chase’s C.E.O., as part of two lawsuits over the bank’s ties to the convicted sex offender, is set for May 26 and 27, according to CNBC. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reports that Mr. Epstein had previously unreported meetings with Larry Summers and the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Mr. Epstein’s private islands were sold for $60 million.
Goldman Sachs reportedly seeks to settle a discrimination lawsuit. The Wall Street bank has held discussions about paying several hundred million dollars to resolve accusations that it systematically discriminated against female employees, The Wall Street Journal reports. A trial in the case is set for next month.
The U.A.W. withholds an endorsement of President Biden. The United Auto Workers, one of America’s most powerful unions, said it was concerned about the White House’s plans for an “electric vehicle transition,” though it hasn’t ruled out backing him later in the 2024 race. It’s a sign of how Mr. Biden’s climate change policies may cost him support from a key constituency.

The F.T.C. and Meta face off
Meta and the F.T.C. have escalated their fight over how the social media giant handles its users’ data. Meta accused the agency and its chair, Lina Khan, of pulling a “political stunt” after it moved to impose “a blanket prohibition” on the company’s collection of personal data from young people.
The agency has come down hard on Meta before for its handling of users’ data. In 2020, it imposed a $5 billion consent order and forced Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, to overhaul its privacy practices. The F.T.C. said yesterday that the company had failed to do so, accusing it of “recklessness” and of putting “young users at risk.”

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The potential penalties are stiff. Meta would be barred from profiting off any data it collects from users under 18, and regulators want that to be extended to 18-year-olds — a move that would limit how the company targets ads to young people.
Meta vowed to fight. “Despite three years of continual engagement with the F.T.C. around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,” the company said in a statement, adding that Ms. Khan’s “insistence on using any measure — however baseless — to antagonize American business has reached a new low.” The company has 30 days to appeal.

Congress is also targeting social networks. Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, yesterday reintroduced a bill to update the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. The lawmakers said in a statement that they were seeking to ban “targeted ads to kids, and stop all online platforms — not just Meta and other companies under F.T.C. consent decrees — from raking in profits through the exploitation of an entire generation.”
What to watch for in Apple’s earnings
Tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have beaten expectations this earnings season. Apple is up next and will report after the closing bell on Thursday. Here are some of the biggest things to watch for.
Stock buybacks: Investors expect Apple, which has spent more money repurchasing shares than any other company, to keep that up. The consensus number this quarter is $90 billion.
China: Nearly 25 percent of Apple’s revenue comes from China, and supply-chain disruptions there led to costly shortages. As the Chinese economy reopens after Covid, the iPhone maker’s sales should continue to recover, and Tim Cook, Apple’s chief, has said that production problems have subsided. But some analysts worry that the company remains overly dependent on China.

Artificial intelligence: Tech leaders have spent a lot of time on their earnings calls touting their progress in adding ChatGPT-like features to their products. Apple has been criticized for failing to keep up with the latest advances. Investors will be anxious to hear whether Cook lays out an expansive vision for the tech.
Governments step up A.I. oversight
Leaders of companies working on artificial intelligence, including Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI, will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, after the White House announced new initiatives to rein in the fast-growing technology.
It’s the latest sign that governments are seeking to tame A.I. as the tech world races to harness the power of products like ChatGPT — and critics warn that the technology threatens to reshape society in potentially negative ways.
White House officials pledged to release draft guidelines for A.I. use in government, to safeguard “the American people’s rights and safety.” The announcement comes a day after Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., called for tighter regulation of the technology.

International regulators are also making moves. The head of Britain’s competition overseer told The Financial Times that the agency would review the A.I. market, with an eye on potential guardrails to protect consumers and smaller companies. That follows plans by the European Union for some of the world’s most sweeping legislation to regulate A.I.
In other A.I. news:
Security engineers at Meta warned of potentially dangerous ChatGPT impostors.
A start-up let users interact with ChatGPT via a female avatar. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that didn’t go well.
A.I. can do many things; can it also be an emotional support companion?
HSBC prepares for an investor showdown over China
At HSBC’s annual meeting on Friday in Birmingham, England, the focus will be on one topic: whether to break up the bank, which is Europe’s biggest. HSBC management argues that the lender benefits from its integrated global operation. But the firm’s largest shareholder, the Chinese insurer Ping An, wants HSBC to spin out its main Asian operations.
Though a shareholder initiative to force HSBC to regularly review its structure may fail on Friday, the pressure on the bank to rethink its future won’t let up anytime soon.
HSBC’s China-facing business accounts for nearly half of its revenue — but Ping An says the division has been held back by having to subsidize its slower-growing Western operations. Asian investors were also angered by a 2020 edict by the Bank of England that British banks stop paying quarterly dividends. (HSBC said this week that it would restart those payouts.)

Last month, Ping An responded to management’s objections by suggesting the less drastic step of giving the Asian business, which is based in Hong Kong, its own stock listing.
HSBC remains unconvinced. Executives have said a breakup risks disrupting what is a well-performing business, and pointed to their efforts to shed nonessential operations like retail banking in North America. A better-than-expected earnings report on Tuesday helped buttress their arguments.
The fight will likely extend beyond Friday. Though HSBC is expected to win the vote on the shareholder proposal, analysts concede that HSBC will face increasing pressure from worsening tensions between Beijing and the West.
Given that Ping An hasn’t shown any desire to walk away, expect the fight over HSBC’s future to continue.

2023-05-05,"When President Biden announced sharp restrictions in October on selling the most advanced computer chips to China, he sold it in part as a way of giving American industry a chance to restore its competitiveness.
But at the Pentagon and the National Security Council, there was a second agenda: arms control.
If the Chinese military cannot get the chips, the theory goes, it may slow its effort to develop weapons driven by artificial intelligence. That would give the White House, and the world, time to figure out some rules for the use of artificial intelligence in sensors, missiles and cyberweapons, and ultimately to guard against some of the nightmares conjured by Hollywood — autonomous killer robots and computers that lock out their human creators.
Now, the fog of fear surrounding the popular ChatGPT chatbot and other generative A.I. software has made the limiting of chips to Beijing look like just a temporary fix. When Mr. Biden dropped by a meeting in the White House on Thursday of technology executives who are struggling with limiting the risks of the technology, his first comment was “what you are doing has enormous potential and enormous danger.”
It was a reflection, his national security aides say, of recent classified briefings about the potential for the new technology to upend war, cyber conflict and — in the most extreme case — decision-making on employing nuclear weapons.

But even as Mr. Biden was issuing his warning, Pentagon officials, speaking at technology forums, said they thought the idea of a six-month pause in developing the next generations of ChatGPT and similar software was a bad idea: The Chinese won’t wait, and neither will the Russians.
“If we stop, guess who’s not going to stop: potential adversaries overseas,” the Pentagon’s chief information officer, John Sherman, said on Wednesday. “We’ve got to keep moving.”
His blunt statement underlined the tension felt throughout the defense community today. No one really knows what these new technologies are capable of when it comes to developing and controlling weapons, and they have no idea what kind of arms control regime, if any, might work.
The foreboding is vague, but deeply worrisome. Could ChatGPT empower bad actors who previously wouldn’t have easy access to destructive technology? Could it speed up confrontations between superpowers, leaving little time for diplomacy and negotiation?

“The industry isn’t stupid here, and you are already seeing efforts to self-regulate,” said Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman who served as the inaugural chairman of the advisory Defense Innovation Board from 2016 to 2020.

“So there’s a series of informal conversations now taking place in the industry — all informal — about what would the rules of A.I. safety look like,” said Mr. Schmidt, who has written, with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a series of articles and books about the potential of artificial intelligence to upend geopolitics.
The preliminary effort to put guardrails into the system is clear to anyone who has tested ChatGPT’s initial iterations. The bots will not answer questions about how to harm someone with a brew of drugs, for example, or how to blow up a dam or cripple nuclear centrifuges, all operations the United States and other nations have engaged in without the benefit of artificial intelligence tools.
But those blacklists of actions will only slow misuse of these systems; few think they can completely stop such efforts. There is always a hack to get around safety limits, as anyone who has tried to turn off the urgent beeps on an automobile’s seatbelt warning system can attest.
Though the new software has popularized the issue, it is hardly a new one for the Pentagon. The first rules on developing autonomous weapons were published a decade ago. The Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was established five years ago to explore the use of artificial intelligence in combat.

Some weapons already operate on autopilot. Patriot missiles, which shoot down missiles or planes entering a protected airspace, have long had an “automatic” mode. It enables them to fire without human intervention when overwhelmed with incoming targets faster than a human could react. But they are supposed to be supervised by humans who can abort attacks if necessary.

The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s top nuclear scientist, was conducted by Israel’s Mossad using an autonomous machine gun that was assisted by artificial intelligence, though there appears to have been a high degree of remote control. Russia said recently it has begun to manufacture — but has not yet deployed — its undersea Poseidon nuclear torpedo. If it lives up to the Russian hype, the weapon would be able to travel across an ocean autonomously, evading existing missile defenses, to deliver a nuclear weapon days after it is launched.
So far there are no treaties or international agreements that deal with such autonomous weapons. In an era when arms control agreements are being abandoned faster than they are being negotiated, there is little prospect of such an accord. But the kind of challenges raised by ChatGPT and its ilk are different, and in some ways more complicated.
In the military, A.I.-infused systems can speed up the tempo of battlefield decisions to such a degree that they create entirely new risks of accidental strikes, or decisions made on misleading or deliberately false alerts of incoming attacks.

“A core problem with A.I. in the military and in national security is how do you defend against attacks that are faster than human decision-making, and I think that issue is unresolved,” Mr. Schmidt said. “In other words, the missile is coming in so fast that there has to be an automatic response. What happens if it’s a false signal?”
The Cold War was littered with stories of false warnings — once because a training tape, meant to be used for practicing nuclear response, was somehow put into the wrong system and set off an alert of a massive incoming Soviet attack. (Good judgment led to everyone standing down.) Paul Scharre, of the Center for a New American Security, noted in his 2018 book “Army of None” that there were “at least 13 near use nuclear incidents from 1962 to 2002,” which “lends credence to the view that near miss incidents are normal, if terrifying, conditions of nuclear weapons.”
For that reason, when tensions between the superpowers were a lot lower than they are today, a series of presidents tried to negotiate building more time into nuclear decision making on all sides, so that no one rushed into conflict. But generative A.I. threatens to push countries in the other direction, toward faster decision-making.
The good news is that the major powers are likely to be careful — because they know what the response from an adversary would look like. But so far there are no agreed-upon rules.
Anja Manuel, a former State Department official and now a principal in the consulting group Rice, Hadley, Gates and Manuel, wrote recently that even if China and Russia are not ready for arms control talks about A.I., meetings on the topic would result in discussions of what uses of A.I. are seen as “beyond the pale.”

Of course, the Pentagon will also worry about agreeing to many limits.
“I fought very hard to get a policy that if you have autonomous elements of weapons, you need a way of turning them off,” said Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who was a pioneer in parallel computers that were used for artificial intelligence. Mr. Hillis, who also served on the Defense Innovation Board, said that Pentagon officials pushed back, saying, “If we can turn them off, the enemy can turn them off, too.”
The bigger risks may come from individual actors, terrorists, ransomware groups or smaller nations with advanced cyber skills — like North Korea — that learn how to clone a smaller, less restricted version of ChatGPT. And they may find that the generative A.I. software is perfect for speeding up cyberattacks and targeting disinformation.
Tom Burt, who leads trust and safety operations at Microsoft, which is speeding ahead with using the new technology to revamp its search engines, said at a recent forum at George Washington University that he thought A.I. systems would help defenders detect anomalous behavior faster than they would help attackers. Other experts disagree. But he said he feared artificial intelligence could “supercharge” the spread of targeted disinformation.
All of this portends a new era of arms control.
Some experts say that since it would be impossible to stop the spread of ChatGPT and similar software, the best hope is to limit the specialty chips and other computing power needed to advance the technology. That will doubtless be one of many different arms control plans put forward in the next few years, at a time when the major nuclear powers, at least, seem uninterested in negotiating over old weapons, much less new ones."

2023-05-07,"Five hours is enough time to watch a Mets game. It is enough time to listen to the Spice Girls’ “Spice” album (40 minutes), Paul Simon’s “Paul Simon” album (42 minutes) and Gustav Mahler’s third symphony (his longest). It is enough time to roast a chicken, text your friends that you’ve roasted a chicken and prepare for an impromptu dinner party.
Or you could spend it checking your email. Five hours is about how long many workers spend on email each day. And 90 minutes on the messaging platform Slack.
It’s a weird thing, workplace chatter like email and Slack: It’s sometimes the most delightful and human part of the work day. It can also be mind-numbing to manage your inbox — to the extent you might wonder, couldn’t a robot do this?
In late April, I decided to see what it would be like to let artificial intelligence into my life. I resolved to do an experiment. For one week, I would write all my work communication — emails, Slack messages, pitches, follow-ups with sources — through ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence language model from the research lab OpenAI. I didn’t tell colleagues until the end of the week (except in a few instances of personal weakness). I downloaded a Chrome extension that drafted email responses directly into my inbox. But most of the time, I ended up writing detailed prompts into ChatGPT, asking it to be either witty or formal depending on the situation.

What resulted was a roller coaster, emotionally and in terms of the amount of content I was generating. I started the week inundating my teammates (sorry) to see how they would react. At a certain point, I lost patience with the bot and developed a newfound appreciation for phone calls.
My bot, unsurprisingly, couldn’t match the emotional tone of any online conversation. And I spend a lot of the week, because of hybrid work, having online conversations.
The impulse to chat with teammates all day isn’t wrong. Most people know the thrill (and also, usefulness) of office friendships from psychologists, economists, TV sitcoms and our own lives; my colleague sends me photos of her baby in increasingly chic onesies every few days, and nothing makes me happier. But the amount of time workers feel they must devote to digitally communicating is undoubtedly excessive — and for some, easy to make the case for handing over to artificial intelligence.
The release of generative A.I. tools has raised all sorts of enormous and thorny questions about work. There are fears about what jobs will be replaced by A.I. in 10 years — Paralegals? Personal assistants? Movie and television writers are currently on strike, and one issue they’re fighting for is limiting the use of A.I. by the studios. There are also fears about the toxic and untruthful information A.I. can spread in an online ecosystem already rife with misinformation.
The question driving my experiment was far narrower: Will we miss our old ways of working if A.I. takes over the drudgery of communication? And would my colleagues even know, or would they be Chatfished?

My experiment started on a Monday morning with a friendly Slack message from an editor in Seoul who had sent me the link to a study analyzing humor across more than 2,000 TED and TEDx Talks. “Pity the researchers,” the editor wrote to me. I asked ChatGPT to say something clever in reply, and the robot wrote: “I mean, I love a good TED Talk as much as the next person, but that’s just cruel and unusual punishment!”
While not at all resembling a sentence I would type, this seemed inoffensive. I hit send.
I had begun the experiment feeling that it was important to be generous in spirit toward my robot co-conspirator. By Tuesday morning, though, I found that my to-do list was straining the limits of my robot’s pseudo-human wit. It so happened that my colleagues on the Business desk were planning a party. Renee, one of the party planners, asked me if I could help draft the invitation.
“Maybe with your journalistic voice, you can write a nicer sentence than I just have,” Renee wrote to me on Slack.
I couldn’t tell her that my use of “journalistic voice” was a sore subject that week. I asked ChatGPT to craft a funny sentence about refreshments. “I am thrilled to announce that our upcoming party will feature an array of delicious cheese plates,” the robot wrote. “Just to spice things up a bit (pun intended), we may even have some with a business-themed twist!”
Renee was unimpressed and, ironically, wrote to me: “OK, wait, let me get the ChatGPT to make a sentence.”

Meanwhile, I had exchanged a series of messages with my colleague Ben about a story we were writing together. In a moment of anxiety, I called him to let him know it was ChatGPT writing the Slack messages, not me, and he admitted that he had wondered whether I was annoyed at him. “I thought I’d broken you!” he said.
When we got off the phone, Ben messaged me: “Robot-Emma is very polite, but in a way I’m slightly concerned might hide her intention to murder me in my sleep.”
“I want to assure you that you can sleep peacefully knowing that your safety and security are not at risk,” my bot replied. “Take care and sleep well.”
Given the amount of time I spend online talking to colleagues — about the news, story ideas, occasionally “Love Is Blind” — it was disconcerting stripping those communications of any personality.
But it’s not at all far-fetched. Microsoft earlier this year introduced a product, Microsoft 365 Copilot, that could handle all the tasks I asked ChatGPT to do and far more. I recently saw it in action when Microsoft’s corporate vice president, Jon Friedman, showed me how Copilot could read emails he’d received, summarize them and then draft possible replies. Copilot can take notes during meetings, analyze spreadsheet data and identify problems that might arise in a project.

I asked Mr. Friedman if Copilot could mimic his sense of humor. He told me that the product wasn’t quite there yet, although it could make valiant comedic attempts. (He has asked it, for example, for pickleball jokes, and it delivered: “Why did the pickleball player refuse to play doubles? They couldn’t dill with the extra pressure!”)
Of course, he continued, Copilot’s purpose is loftier than mediocre comedy. “Most of humanity spends way too much time consumed with what we call the drudgery of work, getting through our inbox,” Mr. Friedman said. “These things just sap our creativity and our energy.”
Mr. Friedman recently asked Copilot to draft a memo, using his notes, recommending one of his employees for a promotion. The recommendation worked. He estimated that two hours’ worth of work was completed in six minutes.
To some, though, the time savings aren’t worth the peculiarity of outsourcing relationships.
“In the future, you’re going to get an email and someone will be like ‘Did you even read it?’ And you’ll be like ‘no’ and then they’ll be like ‘Well I didn’t write the response to you,’” said Matt Buechele, 33, a comedy writer who also makes TikToks about office communications. “It’ll be robots going back and forth to each other, circling back.”
Mr. Buechele, in the middle of our phone interview, asked me unprompted about the email I had sent to him. “Your email style is very professional,” he said.

I confessed that ChatGPT had written the message to him requesting an interview.
“I was sort of like, ‘This is going to be the most awkward conversation of my life,’” he said.
This confirmed a fear I’d been developing that my sources had started to think I was a jerk. One source, for example, had written me an effusive email thanking me for an article I’d written and inviting me to visit his office when I was next in Los Angeles.
ChatGPT’s response was muted, verging on rude: “I appreciate your willingness to collaborate.”
I was feeling mournful of my past exclamation-point studded internet existence. I know people think exclamation points are tacky. The writer Elmore Leonard advised measuring out “two or three per 100,000 words of prose.” Respectfully, I disagree. I often use two or three per two or three words of prose. I’m an apologist for digital enthusiasm. ChatGPT, it turns out, is more reserved.
For all the irritation I developed toward my robot overlord, I found that some of my colleagues were impressed by my newly polished digital persona, including my teammate Jordyn, who consulted me on Wednesday for advice on an article pitch.
“I have a story idea I’d love to chat with you about,” Jordyn wrote to me. “It’s not urgent!!”
“I’m always up for a good story, urgent or not!” my robot replied. “Especially if it’s a juicy one with plot twists and unexpected turns.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
After a few minutes of back-and-forth, I was desperate to talk with Jordyn in person. I was losing patience with the bot’s cloying tone. I missed my own stupid jokes, and (comparatively) normal voice.
More alarmingly, ChatGPT is prone to hallucinating — meaning putting words and ideas together that don’t actually make sense. While writing a note to a source about the timing for an interview, my bot randomly suggested asking him whether we should coordinate our outfits in advance so that our auras and chakras wouldn’t clash.
I asked ChatGPT to draft a message to another colleague, who knew about my experiment, telling him I was in hell. “I’m sorry, but I cannot generate inappropriate or harmful content,” the robot replied. I asked it to draft a message explaining that I was losing my mind. ChatGPT couldn’t do that either.
Of course, many of the A.I. experts I consulted were undeterred by the notion of shedding their personalized communication style. “Truthfully, we copy and paste a lot already,” said Michael Chui, a McKinsey partner and expert in generative A.I.
Mr. Chui conceded that some people see signs of dystopia in a future where workers communicate mostly through robots. He argued, though, that this wouldn’t look all that unlike corporate exchanges that are already formulaic. “I recently had a colleague send me a text message saying, ‘Hey was that last email you sent legit?’” Mr. Chui recalled.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It turned out that the email had been so stiff that the colleague thought it was written through ChatGPT. Mr. Chui’s situation is a bit particular, though. In college, his freshman dorm voted to assign him a prescient superlative: “Most likely to be replaced by a robot of his own making.”
I decided to end the week by asking the deputy editor of my department what role he saw for A.I. in the newsroom’s future. “Do you think there’s a possibility that we could see AI-generated content on the front page one day?” I wrote over Slack. “Or do you think that there are some things that are just better left to human writers?”
“Well, that doesn’t sound like your voice!” the editor replied.
A day later, my experiment complete, I typed back my own response: “That’s a relief!!!”"

2023-05-09,"LinkedIn, the networking platform used by millions of employees and companies, said on Monday it will pare down its operations in China, capping a multiyear pullback that exemplified the challenges of running a foreign business in China.
The company, owned by Microsoft, said it will lay off 716 employees worldwide, including teams dedicated to engineering and marketing in China, because of slumping demand. It did not say how many of those layoffs will be in China.
LinkedIn will also shut its China job posting app, a bare-bones version of its international service, by August. Users of the app, called InCareer, could only search for jobs and not post or share articles the way they can on LinkedIn.
When LinkedIn started a Chinese-language version of its website in 2014, it charted a path that its peers, including Facebook and Google, had shied away from. It partnered with local firms and began censoring the content of millions of Chinese customers in accordance with Beijing’s strict laws. Several U.S. journalists and activists said their profiles had been blocked because of “prohibited content.” The company said at the time that while it opposed government censorship, its absence in the country could deprive Chinese professionals of the chance to make professional connections.

Yet over the years, the challenges for foreign and domestic social media platforms multiplied as the power of China’s censorship machine ballooned under its leader, Xi Jinping. In 2021, LinkedIn closed its flagship networking service in China, citing compliance issues and a “significantly more challenging operating environment.”
In a letter to employees, Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn’s chief executive, said the cuts were prompted by slower revenue growth and fluctuations in customer behavior. The news follows an overall slowdown in tech that has led to tens of thousands of layoffs this year by the largest companies, including Amazon, Meta and Google.
LinkedIn, which employs about 20,000 people, said Monday that while it was reducing operations in China and other countries, it plans to create 250 jobs in other areas.
Mr. Roslansky said it will retain a presence in China to help companies operating in the country hire and train employees from overseas."

The FTX bankruptcy proceeding has been full of surprises.

Too quick to sell?
Working through the bankruptcy of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried’s collapsed crypto exchange, is proving more complicated all the time. The latest evidence: a potentially lucrative missed opportunity that’s come to light after FTX offloaded warrants to buy an obscure crypto token.
The token is called Sui, and it made its trading debut on May 3. FTX — which is now being run by John Ray III, the restructuring expert who has recouped billions for creditors victimized by the mega-bankruptcies of Enron, Fruit of the Loom and Nortel Networks — sold its Sui warrants shortly before the token began trading.
Had FTX exercised the warrants, it would own, as of this morning, an asset worth more than $1 billion, even after a 75 percent drop since the start of trading last week.
Here’s what happened with Sui:
FTX invested about $101 million in Mysten Labs last year. Mysten was building a blockchain platform called Sui that relied on technology developed for Diem, Facebook’s aborted crypto project. Mysten attracted investors like Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, pushing its valuation at one point to about $2 billion.
FTX led the fund-raising last summer. Its ownership interest included warrants for 890 million Sui crypto tokens that would be exercisable once the Sui platform launched. But FTX collapsed months later.
In March, FTX sought the bankruptcy court’s permission to sell its interest in Mysten for about $96 million, or $5 million less than the initial investment.
In April, that deal closed. On May 3, Sui tokens began trading, with prices quickly spiking. This morning, Sui was trading at $1.13.
FTX is in a race to recoup every penny as the creditor list swells. Mr. Bankman-Fried himself has said that if given enough time, he could find the assets of value in his vast empire to begin to pay back customers and investors.

The I.R.S. last month filed nearly $44 billion worth of “priority” tax claims against FTX’s estate and its sister trading firms, CoinDesk reports.
FTX has already found billions for creditors. “The situation has been stabilized and the dumpster fire is out,” the company’s lawyers told a bankruptcy judge last month, revealing that they had recovered more than $7 billion.
Among the crypto community on Twitter, however, there was some snickering that FTX missed a big opportunity in Sui.
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A top investor advisory firm U-turns on Jamie Dimon’s pay. Institutional Shareholder Services, which last week recommended that JPMorgan Chase shareholders oppose the bank’s compensation plan for its C.E.O. and other executives, changed its mind, citing mistakes in its analysis. It’s a remarkable reversal for I.S.S., which had also opposed JPMorgan’s pay policies last year.
SoftBank posts a record $32 billion loss at its Vision Fund. The Japanese conglomerate’s tech-focused investment vehicle missed out on a broader rally in stocks. The downbeat report came as Masa Son, SoftBank’s founder, said the company was stopping new investments and focusing on the I.P.O. of Arm, its chip designer.

The pressure builds on Icahn
Shares in Carl Icahn’s publicly traded investment vehicle fell 15 percent Wednesday, after it revealed that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had asked for documents in the wake of allegations by the short seller Hindenburg Research.
But Mr. Icahn, the octogenarian billionaire who is known for a decades-long career of aggressively shaking up companies, made clear that he isn’t going down without a fight.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A recap: Hindenburg, which makes money by betting that a company’s shares will fall, said in a report last week that Icahn Enterprises was running “Ponzi-like economic structures” by paying out an unjustifiably hefty dividend financed by stock sales. The short seller also said the company was fundamentally overvalued.
The accusations have made their mark: Icahn Enterprises’ stock price is down 40 percent since Hindenburg published its report. That also hits Mr. Icahn directly, since the majority of his shares in the firm — he owns 84 percent of it — are pledged as collateral for bank loans.
Image
Mr. Icahn took the gloves off, calling Hindenburg a peddler of “disinformation campaigns to distort companies’ images, damage their reputations and bleed the hard-earned savings of individual investors.” He added that “unlike many of its victims, we will not stand by idly.”
Meanwhile, Icahn Enterprises noted in a securities filing that federal prosecutors hadn’t accused the company or Mr. Icahn of any impropriety, and that it was cooperating with the inquiry. Hindenburg itself hasn’t accused either of fraud.

But Icahn is also shifting strategy. He chalked up his company’s financial underperformance to its bets against the stock market, and said it would concentrate more on shareholder activism, the investment strategy that made Icahn a billionaire.
Speaking of which, Mr. Icahn scored a victory in his fight against the gene sequencing company Illumina Wednesday, after the proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis recommended that investors approve two of his nominees for Illumina’s board.

Google pushes A.I. in a big way
For months, Google has preached a more cautious approach to artificial intelligence, even as rivals and the public embraced ChatGPT and other new technologies as vanguards of the future.
But at its annual developer conference Wednesday, the Silicon Valley giant unveiled a slew of A.I.-infused products, as it seeks to adopt a technology that, in the hands of competitors, could erode its hugely profitable businesses.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Search was the star of the show. Google was eager to talk about the long-awaited revamp of its core service, which it hopes will steal back the buzz that Microsoft generated when it unveiled a ChatGPT-augmented Bing in February. The updated search engine will incorporate results generated by A.I. and allow users to ask follow-up questions. (Note, however, that it’s not a chatbot.)
Two dozen other Google products, including Gmail, are also being A.I.-ified to help automate user tasks. But perhaps more important, the company revealed its work on more powerful A.I. models, including what it called PaLM2, that could power an even broader and more sophisticated array of services.
“We are at an exciting inflection point,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s C.E.O., said Wednesday. But his longtime caution about a hasty embrace of A.I. — particularly a wariness of products spewing false or misleading information — remained. The new search engine clearly labels its A.I. aspects as “experimental,” and getting access to it requires signing up for the Search Labs service.
That said, investors liked what they saw: Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, rose 4 percent Wednesday, lifting its market value by $56 billion.

E.S.G. hits the House
The political debate over the investment approach known as E.S.G. — short for environmental, social and corporate governance issues — went national Wednesday, as a fight that has largely played out in state capitals moved to Congress.
From the get-go, the hearing of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee was contentious, as Republican and Democratic lawmakers sparred with witnesses, and each other.
Republicans called E.S.G. “an undemocratic tax” on Americans, designed to force an embrace of climate-focused policies that would raise costs for many. The hearing’s witnesses included the attorneys general of Alabama and Utah, who oppose letting their states’ retirement funds go into E.S.G.-guided investments.
ADVERTISEMENT

To Sean Reyes, Utah’s attorney general, E.S.G. was “an open conspiracy to bypass Congress and instead impose costly changes on American consumers,” driven by unelected financial institutions like BlackRock that have pushed to include climate concerns in many investment decisions.
His Alabama counterpart, Steve Marshall, argued that focusing on E.S.G. led to higher energy prices because it discourages the use of cheaper fossil fuels, risking harm to key industries like farming.
Democrats defended E.S.G. as just another investment strategy. Calling opposition to the concept a “widespread, highly coordinated, politically motivated attack” on investors and average Americans, the Illinois state treasurer, Michael Frerichs, said that E.S.G. was simply a different way of weighing risks and opportunities.
It meant that an investor could weigh whether a carmaker was prepared for a market shift to electric cars, or whether to buy into a drugmaker facing a flurry of lawsuits over its role in the opioid epidemic, he said.
Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said that asset and pension managers weighing E.S.G. angles to investments were simply being smart — and to not think about those angles was “a negligent and inattentive investment strategy.”

Expect the fight to continue. The committee’s Republican chairman, Representative James Comer of Kentucky, said lawmakers “would continue to expose and investigate harmful E.S.G. practices and hold unelected bureaucrats accountable for pushing their interests on the American people.”

Game back on for Microsoft-Activision?
Credit...
Martin Meissner/Associated Press
Will Europe muddy the future of Microsoft’s big deal?
European antitrust regulators are set to weigh in Monday on Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard. In a twist, the European Commission is reportedly set to approve a video game megadeal that its American and British counterparts have already rejected.
If that happens, tech giants will be left with an even more confusing regulatory landscape to contend with, as three of the world’s most powerful antitrust regulators take different policy tacks.
The E.U. is expected to be satisfied with Microsoft’s concessions on the deal, namely pledges to make sure top titles like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft are available to rival video game platforms like Sony’s and Nintendo’s.
That would be a very different conclusion than that reached last month by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, which argued that Microsoft could end up dominating the nascent business of cloud gaming — and that no solution apart from selling off big chunks of Activision would be acceptable.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It would be a striking show of leniency by a notoriously tough regulator. The E.U. has been among the most aggressive in policing Big Tech, having fined companies like Google billions and forced changes in their business practices. But in recent years, American regulators like the F.T.C., under Lina Khan, have gone even further, pushing back against takeovers by tech giants, and openly questioning whether they should get even bigger.
Microsoft and others are left trying to navigate an increasingly complicated thicket of global rules, where regulators are coming to very different conclusions about the same issues. And given the size and importance of the British, European and U.S. markets, simply ignoring any one of them is impossible.
The deal’s future is clearer, and bleaker, if the E.U. rejects it. Microsoft and Activision are already appealing the decisions by the F.T.C. and the C.M.A.; overturning the British regulator’s decision is expected to be especially tough. (The body that will weigh the C.M.A. appeal could take months, and will review only whether the regulator’s decision followed proper procedures.)
Fighting a third battle — especially against a regulator that overwhelmingly tends to succeed in appeals — would only make an especially difficult fight that much harder.

The many losers of the Vice bankruptcy
Vice, the once-highflying digital media outlet, filed for bankruptcy overnight, as the punishing economics of online publishing took their toll.
The company has received at least one rescue bid to acquire it out of Chapter 11, potentially sparing it a drawn-out and disruptive trip through bankruptcy. But the $225 million offer price is a reminder of how far Vice has fallen, taking some of the top names in media and finance with it.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
It was just six years ago that Vice was valued at $5.7 billion, as the upstart drew in investors like TPG, Disney, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and the advertising giant WPP.
All those companies expected Vice — along with rivals like BuzzFeed and Vox — to reinvent the media business through a focus on youthful content and an ability to draw in reader eyeballs from social media platforms. At the time, Vice and its backers dreamed of going public or selling at an even higher valuation.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Now those investors are set to be wiped out. Vice, like its peers, failed to wring profits from its audience, losing most of that revenue to the social networks that funneled readers to them. BuzzFeed has shut its news division and is at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq, while Vox has slashed its valuation in half.
Vice could soon be taken over by major creditors, led by Fortress and Soros Fund Management, who first lent the publisher $250 million in 2019. The two have offered to essentially convert what Vice owes them into equity, to the tune of $225 million, as well as assume other “significant liabilities.” (They would also likely keep on Shane Smith, the publisher’s outspoken co-founder and most prominent personality.)
It’s unclear whether others will make offers, especially given the economic uncertainty around the online publishing business. For their part, Vice’s current leaders said the bankruptcy filing and subsequent sale would ultimately “strengthen the company.”
Where do chatbots fit into the workplace?

Business leaders are increasingly wrestling with how to use A.I. as ChatGPT and its rivals seize more and more of the public’s attention, and as customers, employees and investors ask where companies stand on the technology, Kevin Delaney writes for DealBook.
Here’s what’s at stake:
Moving too slowly may mean losing out on gains in productivity, customer service and — ultimately — competitiveness, similar to what happened to businesses that didn’t embrace the internet fully or fast enough. But at the same time, leaders must guard against the mistakes and biases A.I. often perpetuates and be thoughtful about what it means for employees.
“Almost no matter which sector you are in, you need to be thinking about your company as becoming an A.I.-first company,” said Alexandra Mousavizadeh, chief executive at Evident, a start-up that analyzes finance companies’ A.I. capabilities.

The week ahead

Sam Altman has been a promoter of A.I., and a voice of caution.

Ruth Fremson/The New York Times
A.I. takes center stage on the Hill
As the C.E.O. of OpenAI, Sam Altman has become one of the most prominent evangelists for the next generation of artificial intelligence offerings. ChatGPT, his company’s most notable product, has captured the public’s imagination like no tech product has in years, inspiring hopes and fears about its transformative powers.
As Mr. Altman prepares to testify before a Senate judiciary subcommittee today, his first appearance before Congress, expect plenty of questions about how his company and its rivals are rushing to create a new generation of technologies — and how they should be regulated.
Washington is racing to figure out A.I.:
Lawmakers in both parties have stressed the importance of reining in the rapidly growing technology, which can now generate realistic-sounding text and images and computer code. Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said he was working on legislation that would address the risks that artificial intelligence poses while allowing innovation to flourish.
This month, Vice President Kamala Harris met with top A.I. executives, including Mr. Altman, as the Biden administration said it supported legislative efforts to create new rules and government investment.
Enforcement agencies are also staying vigilant: Lina Khan, the F.T.C.’s chair, warned recently of potential anticompetitive practices by tech giants pursuing A.I., as well as of potential fraud enabled by new products.
Mr. Altman has been frank about the potential dangers of A.I. “It’d be crazy not to be a little bit afraid, and I empathize with people who are a lot afraid,” he said in March. “The current worries that I have are that there are going to be disinformation problems or economic shocks, or something else at a level far beyond anything we’re prepared for.” He’s expected to say in his testimony that “the regulation of A.I. is essential.”
It’s an acknowledgment both that A.I. is growing by leaps and bounds — Microsoft researchers recently published a paper asserting that its technology has shown signs of human reasoning — and that it had worried some pioneers in the field.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It’s also a politically wise approach, potentially winning over nervous lawmakers — whose concerns include job losses and falling behind China — and helping steer forthcoming legislation away from cracking down on the fast-growing industry.
The stakes are high. Lawmakers have acknowledged that they must strike a delicate balance in constraining tech companies while allowing them to innovate.
Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of psychology and neural science at N.Y.U. who is also testifying today, put it this way to DealBook: “My greatest concern is that we will miss this moment and let the shape of the A.I. landscape be formed by a bunch of short-term interests that we come to regret later.”

Greg Becker is expected to testify at a Senate hearing today about his regret over the lender’s collapse — and lay blame on Fed regulators and on “rumors and misconceptions” spread online that he says led to a ruinous bank run. Lawmakers will most likely press him about his close ties to the San Francisco Fed.
The E.U. approves Microsoft’s $69 billion bid for Activision Blizzard. Antitrust officials in Brussels said that pledges to make top Activision titles available on rival video game platforms would maintain competition. The decision breaks from efforts by American and British regulators who are seeking to block the deal.
Warren Buffett’s conglomerate bets big on Capital One. Berkshire Hathaway disclosed yesterday that it had acquired a $954 million stake in the credit card issuer last quarter. But Mr. Buffett’s investment vehicle was a net seller of stocks, reducing its stake in Chevron and selling off all of its shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
Wells Fargo settles a class-action lawsuit for $1 billion. The payment is the latest stemming from a huge yearslong fraud in which representatives opened sham customer accounts to bolster their sales goals.

Elon Musk is drawn into the Jeffrey Epstein mess
The ever-expanding Jeffrey Epstein legal affair has ensnared yet another prominent corporate titan: Elon Musk.

The U.S. Virgin Islands revealed in court documents yesterday that it had sought to subpoena the Tesla and Twitter chief over his ties to JPMorgan Chase, the bank it has accused of helping facilitate Mr. Epstein’s sex trafficking of young women.
U.S. Virgin Islands prosecutors said Epstein may have referred Musk to JPMorgan. Musk isn’t alone: The prosecutors have also sought to question the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, the Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz and the real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman.
But Mr. Musk dismissed the Virgin Islands’ claim as “idiotic on so many levels,” tweeting that he never sought out that “cretin,” Mr. Epstein, for financial advice. The billionaire also had harsh words for JPMorgan, asserting that the bank “let Tesla down ten years ago, despite having Tesla’s global commercial banking business, which we then withdrew.” He added for good measure, “I have never forgiven them.”
Mr. Musk suffered a separate legal setback yesterday. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit threw out his bid to end an S.E.C. consent decree requiring a Tesla lawyer to review any of his tweets related to the company. That guardrail was put in place in 2018 after Mr. Musk tweeted that he had secured money to take the carmaker private, a move that invited S.E.C. action and shareholder lawsuits.

Neither the agency’s requirement nor yesterday’s ruling has deterred Musk from posting inflammatory tweets on other matters, including his comments yesterday likening George Soros to Magneto, the longtime comic-book villain (who is actually less of a villain these days, but we digress).
Mr. Musk is likely to have an easier time today at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting: Just one shareholder proposal, on succession planning, is up for a vote. But investors have protested the decision to push up the event by three months, saying it gave them less time to file any dissident shareholder proposals.
Mr. Musk joined other business leaders in France yesterday for a business investment summit. The country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, later tweeted that the two had discussed the electric vehicle market, the energy sector and digital regulation.
Coinbase’s chief wins backing for his longevity bet
Brian Armstrong co-founded Coinbase as a way of disrupting traditional finance systems by making it easier to trade cryptocurrencies. But he has also been busy helping create NewLimit, a start-up focused on breaking past traditional limits of human longevity.
That company is now taking a big step toward advancing its goals: It has raised $40 million in Series A financing, DealBook is first to report, to help fund its research.
NewLimit is looking at reprogramming cells to be young again. By essentially reversing aging through a combination of genetic manipulation and machine learning, the hope goes, scientists would be able to eliminate the underlying causes of many major diseases. “If it works, it will change the arc of humanity,” Mr. Armstrong told DealBook.
Mr. Armstrong, who with the venture capitalist Blake Byers founded NewLimit in 2021 with $100 million of their own money, is the latest tech mogul to be fascinated by longevity. Peter Thiel, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Oracle’s Larry Ellison are among those who have poured millions into companies researching it.

NewLimit’s approach has won prominent backers. Investors in the new financing round include the venture capital firms Dimension, Kleiner Perkins and Thiel’s Founders Fund, as well as Eric Schmidt, Google’s former C.E.O., and Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase’s other founder.
The question is whether the science will pan out. Epigenetic programming is in its infancy, and it’s unclear how long it will take to develop applications that actually reverse aging. But Mr. Armstrong asserted that the promise was worth betting millions on: “There’s smoke,” he said.
America’s hugely indebted consumers
An important measure of the financial health of the U.S. consumer, retail sales data, is scheduled to be released today. Forecasters expect the latest stats to show that despite rising prices, consumers — the engine of the American economy — are continuing to spend.
But information released yesterday shows that while consumers are keeping their wallets open, that’s coming at a major cost.

Total U.S. household debt hit a record $17.05 trillion last quarter, according to data published by the New York Fed yesterday. Ballooning mortgage payments and student and car loan obligations are the big culprits. One silver lining: Credit card debt levels remained fairly stable, economists at Nomura wrote in an investor report yesterday.
Image
Consumer debt levels began to soar during the coronavirus pandemic, after rising steadily for the past decade. According to the Fed, total household debt has jumped by nearly $2.8 trillion since the first quarter of 2020, a gain of nearly 20 percent.
With interest rates at a near 16-year high, this could put more pressure on indebted consumers to pull back on spending, potentially increasing the likelihood of a recession.

2023-05-18,"Twitter on Thursday sent a letter to Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, accusing the tech giant of improperly using the social media company’s data.
In the letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times, Twitter said Microsoft had violated an agreement over its data and had declined to pay for that usage. In some cases, the letter said, Microsoft had used more Twitter data than it was supposed to. Microsoft also shared the Twitter data with government agencies without permission, the letter said.
“Microsoft may have been in violation of multiple provisions of the agreement for an extended period of time,” Alex Spiro, the personal lawyer for Elon Musk, who owns Twitter, wrote in the letter to Mr. Nadella.
The letter may be a prelude to Twitter trying to charge Microsoft for its data. Mr. Musk, who bought Twitter last year for $44 billion, has said that it is urgent for the company to make money and that it is near bankruptcy. Twitter has since introduced new subscription products and made other moves to gain more revenue. In March, the company said it would charge more for developers to gain access to its stream of tweets.
Last month, Mr. Musk publicly called out Microsoft for “illegally” using Twitter’s data to train its artificial intelligence technologies. “Lawsuit time,” he tweeted at the time.
Microsoft said it did not currently pay Twitter for its data. Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, said the company had received Twitter’s letter and would review the questions and respond. “We look forward to continuing our long-term partnership with the company,” he said.

Only “two have a chance to get elected.” And Donald Trump isn’t one of them, contends Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.

An economic setback on the eve of a presidential run
After months of anticipation, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is expected to formally declare his candidacy for president next week, officially taking on Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.
But while Mr. DeSantis privately told donors and supporters on a telephone call on Thursday that he, not Trump, had the best chance of beating President Biden, he suffered another blow in his fight with Disney — one that may cost Florida thousands of jobs and raise more questions about his policies and strategy.
DeSantis dismissed Trump’s chances for victory. During the call, he said that just “two have a chance to get elected president — Biden and me.” Mr. DeSantis also ticked off his list of legislative accomplishments.
He undoubtedly is on strong financial footing, with more than $80 million expected to be transferred from his state account to his Super PAC, which has already raised more than $30 million.

But Disney dealt Mr. DeSantis a significant defeat on Thursday, scrapping plans to build a $1 billion office complex in Orlando that was expected to bring more than 2,000 jobs with an average salary of $120,000. Florida officials had repeatedly cited the development as a promising economic opportunity for Orlando, with hotel chains and retailers arriving in anticipation of the project.
People familiar with the decision told The Times that Disney’s feud with Mr. DeSantis — which had escalated into a bitter fight over control of the entity that oversees Disney World — played a major factor. That said, the plan had been devised under Disney’s former chief, Bob Chapek, and his predecessor/successor, Bob Iger, had long been cool to the idea.
Mr. DeSantis didn’t mention the Disney decision in Thursday’s call, though a spokesman said that it was unsurprising, given Disney’s “financial straits.”
The news may stoke further doubts about Mr. DeSantis’s judgment. Several prominent Republican donors, including the billionaire Thomas Peterffy, have already questioned the governor’s hard-right approach to social issues including abortion and the banning of some books from Florida schools.
The billionaire financier Ken Griffin is among those who have criticized Mr. DeSantis’s use of his office to punish Disney. “It’s important that the leaders in both parties stay above the fray when it comes to retaliation against corporate America,” Mr. Griffin said this month.

The Fox News commentator Dagen McDowell summed up many critics’ points on Thursday when she said on air, “Ron DeSantis does not have an economic plan as of yet, and today Disney just pulled a $1 billion investment out of Florida.”

TikTok users sue Montana over its ban on the Chinese-owned video app. The consumers argued that the new state law, the first in the U.S., violated their First Amendment rights and outstripped Montana’s legal authority. It is the first effort to block the law, which experts had already said would be difficult to enforce.
Twitter accuses Microsoft of improperly using its data. Elon Musk’s social network said the technology giant hadn’t paid for additional use of its user information. The fight may be rooted in the use of Twitter data to train artificial intelligence products. Meanwhile, the advertising agency GroupM has reportedly told clients that Twitter is no longer a “high risk” platform now that the tech platform has hired the former NBCUniversal ad chief Linda Yaccarino as C.E.O.

Is a rate increase back on the table?
Market futures on Friday are pricing in a nearly 40 percent chance that the Fed will raise interest rates at its meeting next month, after a sharp escalation in recent days that puts in doubt a highly anticipated pause in rate increases.
Last week, Wall Street thought another increase was unlikely, especially after the most recent Consumer Price Index report showed that inflation had slowed — barely — for a 10th straight month.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
But consumer prices remain well above the Fed’s inflation target of 2 percent and officials at the central bank signaled this week that they’re still feeling hawkish: “We aren’t there yet,” said Lorie Logan, the Dallas Fed president, while the nonvoting member Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed said, “I need to see more evidence that inflation is still moving down.”

Another quarter-percent increase is a “serious possibility,” Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote to investors on Friday. And Quincy Krosby, the chief global strategist at LPL Financial, wrote that Fed officials had been sending a message: Don’t even start pricing in a pause in rate increases, let alone a cut.
The latest signal on the Fed’s thinking could come in a speech on Friday by its chairman, Jay Powell. He’s scheduled to speak at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in Washington. Ms. Krosby of LPL notes that Powell has been “critical of the ‘stop and go’ monetary policy in the 1970s” that led to stagflation.
If Mr. Powell brings up that topic on Friday, Ms. Krosby adds, it may signal to the markets that unless data shows a marked improvement in inflation, “he’ll advocate another rate hike.”
Another factor to keep an eye out for is progress in the debt-limit talks, as Washington edges closer to the so-called X-date, or the point at which the U.S. runs out of money. There’s some cautious optimism that a breakthrough will be reached this weekend, but there’s no certainty that President Biden will be able to win over progressive Democrats.

Tech giants win big at the Supreme Court
Big Tech scored a major victory on Thursday when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in two cases to leave intact the sweeping legal protections that have helped social media giants like Google, Meta and Twitter become forces in online publishing.
Hanging over the cases was the future of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The tech industry holds that the 1996 law is vital to its business model, shielding it from liability when users publish content to their online platforms. The same law gives the companies protections when they step in to moderate posts.
Lawmakers on the right and left argue that the Section 230 protections are too strong. Democrats want social media outlets do more to police their networks to prevent misinformation while Republicans say the sites have gone too far to muzzle voices on the right.
The cases arose from complaints brought by family members of the victims of ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris and Istanbul who argued that the Google and Twitter platforms helped the group spread its messages.
The justices disagreed, writing, “defendants’ mere creation of their media platforms is no more culpable than the creation of email, cellphones, or the internet generally.” They also found that the company’s recommendations algorithms were “agnostic,” meaning that they did not intentionally give more prominence to ISIS’s posted comments.

The tech industry cheered the decision. “Companies, scholars, content creators and civil society organizations who joined with us in this case will be reassured by this result,” Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google’s general counsel, said in a statement. Tech firms had feared that any watering down of Section 230 would lead to a chilling of internet activity that could harm their businesses.
In the end, the justices sidestepped Section 230. The court’s opinion makes no mention of the law. Instead, the justices leaned heavily on legal questions around antiterrorism laws, finding the firms did not violate those.
Remembering Sam Zell, the “grave dancer”

Sam Zell, the real estate tycoon who built a fortune by buying distressed assets, died on Thursday at 81. Over a decades-long career, he made billions from savvy investments in real estate that others had overlooked, while developing a memorable persona as a foul-mouthed, jeans-wearing financial guru.

Mr. Zell amassed an empire of undervalued real estate assets, including apartments, offices and other pieces of commercial properties, benefiting when markets turned and their worth recovered. It’s an approach he first honed in college, when he and a partner bought cheap homes, fixed them up and rented them to other students.
It became highly lucrative when Mr. Zell sold his holdings — then known as Equity Office Properties — to Blackstone in 2007 for $39 billion, a year before the global financial crisis devastated the real estate market. It was Mr. Zell himself who came up with his most enduring nickname, “grave dancer.”
Of Zell’s impact on the real estate industry, the New York developer Scott Rechler told The Wall Street Journal, “He was an evangelist, cheerleader and disciplinarian making sure it grew in the right way.”
But Mr. Zell made a disastrous investment in Tribune, the newspaper and TV station owner, done through an $8.2 billion deal in which he put up just $315 million and saddled employees with $13 billion in debt. (The Times’s Floyd Norris called it “one of the most absurd deals ever.”)

Though Mr. Zell had sought to apply his real estate playbook to newspapers and TV stations, he failed to effectively stem steep losses in audiences and advertising. Less than a year after buying Tribune, it filed for bankruptcy, emerging years later worth half as much, and with him gone.

Eight years after a controversy over Black people being mislabeled as gorillas by image analysis software — and despite big advances in computer vision — tech giants still fear repeating the mistake.
By Nico Grant and Kashmir Hill
May 22, 2023
When Google released its stand-alone Photos app in May 2015, people were wowed by what it could do: analyze images to label the people, places and things in them, an astounding consumer offering at the time. But a couple of months after the release, a software developer, Jacky Alciné, discovered that Google had labeled photos of him and a friend, who are both Black, as “gorillas,” a term that is particularly offensive because it echoes centuries of racist tropes.
In the ensuing controversy, Google prevented its software from categorizing anything in Photos as gorillas, and it vowed to fix the problem. Eight years later, with significant advances in artificial intelligence, we tested whether Google had resolved the issue, and we looked at comparable tools from its competitors: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.

Photo apps made by Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft rely on artificial intelligence to allow us to search for particular items, and pinpoint specific memories, in our increasingly large photo collections. Want to find your day at the zoo out of 8,000 images? Ask the app. So to test the search function, we curated 44 images featuring people, animals and everyday objects.
We started with Google Photos. When we searched our collection for cats and kangaroos, we got images that matched our queries. The app performed well in recognizing most other animals.
But when we looked for gorillas, Google Photos failed to find any images. We widened our search to baboons, chimpanzees, orangutans and monkeys, and it still failed even though there were images of all of these primates in our collection.
We then looked at Google’s competitors. We discovered Apple Photos had the same issue: It could accurately find photos of particular animals, except for most primates. We did get results for gorilla, but only when the text appeared in a photo, such as an image of Gorilla Tape.
The photo search in Microsoft OneDrive drew a blank for every animal we tried. Amazon Photos showed results for all searches, but it was over-inclusive. When we searched for gorillas, the app showed a menagerie of primates, and repeated that pattern for other animals.
There was one member of the primate family that Google and Apple were able to recognize — lemurs, the permanently startled-looking, long-tailed animals that share opposable thumbs with humans, but are more distantly related than are apes.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Google’s and Apple’s tools were clearly the most sophisticated when it came to image analysis.
Yet Google, whose Android software underpins most of the world’s smartphones, has made the decision to turn off the ability to visually search for primates for fear of making an offensive mistake and labeling a person as an animal. And Apple, with technology that performed similarly to Google’s in our test, appeared to disable the ability to look for monkeys and apes as well.
Consumers may not need to frequently perform such a search — though in 2019, an iPhone user complained on Apple’s customer support forum that the software “can’t find monkeys in photos on my device.” But the issue raises larger questions about other unfixed, or unfixable, flaws lurking in services that rely on computer vision — a technology that interprets visual images — as well as other products powered by A.I.
Mr. Alciné was dismayed to learn that Google has still not fully solved the problem and said society puts too much trust in technology.
“I’m going to forever have no faith in this A.I.,” he said.
Computer vision products are now used for tasks as mundane as sending an alert when there is a package on the doorstep, and as weighty as navigating cars and finding perpetrators in law enforcement investigations.
Errors can reflect racist attitudes among those encoding the data. In the gorilla incident, two former Google employees who worked on this technology said the problem was that the company had not put enough photos of Black people in the image collection that it used to train its A.I. system. As a result, the technology was not familiar enough with darker-skinned people and confused them for gorillas.

As artificial intelligence becomes more embedded in our lives, it is eliciting fears of unintended consequences. Although computer vision products and A.I. chatbots like ChatGPT are different, both depend on underlying reams of data that train the software, and both can misfire because of flaws in the data or biases incorporated into their code.
Microsoft recently limited users’ ability to interact with a chatbot built into its search engine, Bing, after it instigated inappropriate conversations.
Microsoft’s decision, like Google’s choice to prevent its algorithm from identifying gorillas altogether, illustrates a common industry approach — to wall off technology features that malfunction rather than fixing them.
“Solving these issues is important,” said Vicente Ordóñez, a professor at Rice University who studies computer vision. “How can we trust this software for other scenarios?”
Michael Marconi, a Google spokesman, said Google had prevented its photo app from labeling anything as a monkey or ape because it decided the benefit “does not outweigh the risk of harm.”

Apple declined to comment on users’ inability to search for most primates on its app.
Representatives from Amazon and Microsoft said the companies were always seeking to improve their products.
Bad Vision
When Google was developing its photo app, which was released eight years ago, it collected a large amount of images to train the A.I. system to identify people, animals and objects.
Its significant oversight — that there were not enough photos of Black people in its training data — caused the app to later malfunction, two former Google employees said. The company failed to uncover the “gorilla” problem back then because it had not asked enough employees to test the feature before its public debut, the former employees said.
Google profusely apologized for the gorillas incident, but it was one of a number of episodes in the wider tech industry that have led to accusations of bias.
Other products that have been criticized include HP’s facial-tracking webcams, which could not detect some people with dark skin, and the Apple Watch, which, according to a lawsuit, failed to accurately read blood oxygen levels across skin colors. The lapses suggested that tech products were not being designed for people with darker skin. (Apple pointed to a paper from 2022 that detailed its efforts to test its blood oxygen app on a “wide range of skin types and tones.”)

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Years after the Google Photos error, the company encountered a similar problem with its Nest home-security camera during internal testing, according to a person familiar with the incident who worked at Google at the time. The Nest camera, which used A.I. to determine whether someone on a property was familiar or unfamiliar, mistook some Black people for animals. Google rushed to fix the problem before users had access to the product, the person said.
However, Nest customers continue to complain on the company’s forums about other flaws. In 2021, a customer received alerts that his mother was ringing the doorbell but found his mother-in-law instead on the other side of the door. When users complained that the system was mixing up faces they had marked as “familiar,” a customer support representative in the forum advised them to delete all of their labels and start over.
Mr. Marconi, the Google spokesman, said that “our goal is to prevent these types of mistakes from ever happening.” He added that the company had improved its technology “by partnering with experts and diversifying our image datasets.”
In 2019, Google tried to improve a facial-recognition feature for Android smartphones by increasing the number of people with dark skin in its data set. But the contractors whom Google had hired to collect facial scans reportedly resorted to a troubling tactic to compensate for that dearth of diverse data: They targeted homeless people and students. Google executives called the incident “very disturbing” at the time.
The Fix?
While Google worked behind the scenes to improve the technology, it never allowed users to judge those efforts.

Margaret Mitchell, a researcher and co-founder of Google’s Ethical AI group, joined the company after the gorilla incident and collaborated with the Photos team. She said in a recent interview that she was a proponent of Google’s decision to remove “the gorillas label, at least for a while.”
“You have to think about how often someone needs to label a gorilla versus perpetuating harmful stereotypes,” Dr. Mitchell said. “The benefits don’t outweigh the potential harms of doing it wrong.”
Dr. Ordóñez, the professor, speculated that Google and Apple could now be capable of distinguishing primates from humans, but that they didn’t want to enable the feature given the possible reputational risk if it misfired again.
Google has since released a more powerful image analysis product, Google Lens, a tool to search the web with photos rather than text. Wired discovered in 2018 that the tool was also unable to identify a gorilla.
When we showed Lens a photo of a dog, it was able to suggest its likely breed.
But when we showed it a gorilla, a chimpanzee, a baboon, and an orangutan, Lens seemed to be stumped, refusing to label what was in the image and surfacing only “visual matches” — photos it deemed similar to the original picture.
For gorillas, it showed photos of other gorillas, suggesting that the technology recognizes the animal but that the
company is afraid of labeling it.
These systems are never foolproof, said Dr. Mitchell, who is no longer working at Google. Because billions of people use Google’s services, even rare glitches that happen to only one person out of a billion users will surface.
“It only takes one mistake to have massive social ramifications,” she said, referring to it as “the poisoned needle in a haystack.”"
2023-05-23,
2023-05-24,"Around the time that the F.B.I. was examining the equipment recovered from the Chinese spy balloon shot down off the South Carolina coast in February, American intelligence agencies and Microsoft detected what they feared was a more worrisome intruder: mysterious computer code appearing in telecommunications systems in Guam and elsewhere in the United States.
The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, raised alarms because Guam, with its Pacific ports and vast American air base, would be a centerpiece of any American military response to an invasion or blockade of Taiwan. The operation was conducted with great stealth, sometimes flowing through home routers and other common internet-connected consumer devices, to make the intrusion harder to track.
The code is called a “web shell,” in this case a malicious script that enables remote access to a server. Home routers are particularly vulnerable, especially older models that have not had updated software and protections.
Unlike the balloon that fascinated Americans as it performed pirouettes over sensitive nuclear sites, the computer code could not be shot down on live television. So instead, Microsoft on Wednesday published details of the code that would make it possible for corporate users, manufacturers and others to detect and remove it. In a coordinated release, the National Security Agency — along with other domestic agencies and counterparts in Australia, Britain, New Zealand and Canada — published a 24-page advisory that referred to Microsoft’s finding and offered broader warnings about a “recently discovered cluster of activity” from China.
ADVERTISEMENT

Microsoft called the hacking group “Volt Typhoon” and said that it was part of a state-sponsored Chinese effort aimed at not only critical infrastructure such as communications, electric and gas utilities, but also maritime operations and transportation. The intrusions appeared, for now, to be an espionage campaign. But the Chinese could use the code, which is designed to pierce firewalls, to enable destructive attacks, if they choose.
So far, Microsoft says, there is no evidence that the Chinese group has used the access for any offensive attacks. Unlike Russian groups, the Chinese intelligence and military hackers usually prioritize espionage.
In interviews, administration officials said they believed the code was part of a vast Chinese intelligence collection effort that spans cyberspace, outer space and, as Americans discovered with the balloon incident, the lower atmosphere.
The Biden administration has declined to discuss what the F.B.I. found as it examined the equipment recovered from the balloon. But the craft — better described as a huge aerial vehicle — apparently included specialized radars and communications interception devices that the F.B.I. has been examining since the balloon was shot down.
It is unclear whether the government’s silence about its finding from the balloon is motivated by a desire to keep the Chinese government from knowing what the United States has learned or to get past the diplomatic breach that followed the incursion.

On Sunday, speaking at a news conference in Hiroshima, Japan, President Biden referred to how the balloon incident had paralyzed the already frosty exchanges between Washington and Beijing.
“And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars’ worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States,” he told reporters, “and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another.”
He predicted that relations would “begin to thaw very shortly.”
China has never acknowledged hacking into American networks, even in the biggest example of all: the theft of security clearance files of roughly 22 million Americans — including six million sets of fingerprints — from the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration. That exfiltration of data took the better part of a year, and resulted in an agreement between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity.
On Wednesday, China sent a warning to its companies to be alert to American hacking. And there has been plenty of that, too: In documents released by Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, there was evidence of American efforts to hack into the systems of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and military and leadership targets.
Telecommunications networks are key targets for hackers, and the system in Guam is particularly important to China because military communications often piggyback on commercial networks.

Tom Burt, the executive who oversees Microsoft’s threat intelligence unit, said in an interview that the company’s analysts — many of them veterans of the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies — had found the code “while investigating intrusion activity impacting a U.S. port.” As they traced back the intrusion, they found other networks that were hit, “including some in the telecommunications sector in Guam.”
Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said that covert efforts “like the activity exposed today are part of what’s driving our focus on the security of telecom networks and the urgency to use trusted vendors” whose equipment has met established cybersecurity standards.
Ms. Neuberger has been spearheading an effort across the federal government to enforce new cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure. Officials were taken by surprise by the extent of the vulnerabilities in such infrastructure when a Russian ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in 2021 interrupted gasoline, diesel and airplane fuel flow on the East Coast. In the wake of the attack, the Biden administration used little-known powers of the Transportation Security Administration — which regulates pipelines — to force private-sector utilities to follow a series of cybersecurity mandates.
Now Ms. Neuberger is driving what she called a “relentless focus on improving the cybersecurity of our pipelines, rail systems, water systems and other critical services,” including the mandates on cybersecurity practices for these sectors and closer collaboration with companies with “unique visibility” into threats to such infrastructure.
Those firms include Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and many telecommunications firms that can see activity on domestic networks. Intelligence agencies, including the N.S.A., are forbidden by law from operating inside the United States. But the N.S.A. is permitted to publish warnings, as it did on Wednesday, alongside the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Infrastructure and Security Administration.

The agency’s report is part of a relatively new U.S. government move to publish such data quickly in hopes of burning operations like the one mounted by the Chinese government. In years past, the United States usually withheld such information — sometimes classifying it — and shared it with only a select few companies or organizations. But that almost always assured that the hackers could stay well ahead of the government.
In this case, it was the focus on Guam that particularly seized the attention of officials who are assessing China’s capabilities — and its willingness — to attack or choke off Taiwan. Mr. Xi has ordered the People’s Liberation Army to be capable of taking the island by 2027. But the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, has noted to Congress that the order “does not mean he has decided to conduct an invasion.”
In the dozens of U.S. tabletop exercises conducted in recent years to map out what such an attack might look like, one of China’s first anticipated moves would be to cut off American communications and slow the United States’ ability to respond. So the exercises envision attacks on satellite and ground communications, especially around American installations where military assets would be mobilized.
None is bigger than Guam, where Andersen Air Force Base would be the launching point for many of the Air Force missions to help defend the island, and a Navy port is crucial for American submarines."
2023-05-25,"Shares in the chip maker Nvidia soared more than 24 percent on Thursday, after the company delivered a knockout quarterly sales outlook powered by demand for the processors that run artificial intelligence systems.
“We’re seeing incredible orders to retool the world’s data centers,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, told analysts Wednesday on a conference call.
Nvidia’s chips are used to power A.I. systems; demand for the chips jumped during the boom in cryptocurrency, whose systems also rely on their processing power. At the close of trading on Wednesday, Nvidia’s market capitalization hit $755 billion, the fifth-highest public valuation in the United States. On Thursday, the company closed in on the trillion-dollar club, at $939 billion.
The A.I. rally has also lifted other chip stocks, including those for AMD, ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Since the introduction of the ChatGPT chatbot in November, the buzz around A.I. has intensified, making companies at the forefront of the technology, like Microsoft, Google and Nvidia, a popular pick among investors.

The rise in Nvidia’s shares has also propelled the entire market higher, with its surge on Thursday enough to move the S&P 500 stock index up nearly 1 percent.
Nvidia’s share price has more than doubled in 2023 even as concerns of a budding microchip war between Washington and Beijing hangs over the sector.
But analysts disagree on how long the rally will last. Michael Hartnett of Bank of America called the rise the start of a “baby bubble.” On the other hand, researchers at Goldman Sachs said tools built on A.I. could help bolster the global economy by $7 trillion.
Demand for Nvidia’s chips is increasing amid calls for greater oversight of A.I. technology. After meeting with top European Union officials on Wednesday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, promised that Google would work with others to develop A.I. services responsibly.
And starting in July, New York will require companies that use A.I. for job recruitment to inform the candidates, under a new law that is being closely watched by labor advocates.

2023-05-26,"The Treasury Department said its cash balance fell to $38.8 billion as of Thursday, as the United States inched toward running out of cash to pay its bills.
That was significantly lower than the $316 billion the department had in operating cash, which is held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the start of the month.
Just how empty is the Treasury cash coffer? For comparison, $38.8 billion is on par with the gross domestic product of Bahrain and Paraguay and lower than the net worth of more than two dozen of the wealthiest people in the world. Of course, much of the assets of those billionaires are tied up in stocks, rather than liquid assets.
Here is a list of people with higher net worths than the U.S. cash reserves, according to Bloomberg News’s Billionaire Index as of Thursday.

2023-05-27,"Summer vacation season is here. But if you’re like a surprising number of Americans, you’re probably leaving some paid time off on the table. Among workers whose employer offers paid vacation or leave, 46 percent said they typically took less time off than was offered, a recent Pew survey found. Here’s why:
They don’t feel they need to take more time off (52 percent).
They worry about falling behind at work (49 percent).
They feel bad about having co-workers take on additional work (43 percent).
They think taking more time off might hurt their chances for career advancement (19 percent).
They think they might risk losing their job (16 percent).
Their manager discourages taking time off (12 percent).
Decisions that leaders make about work culture most likely play into several of these reasons, such as a fear of being retaliated against or missing a promotion. And worry about leaving co-workers with extra work could be more intense on a team that is poorly managed or understaffed.
At the same time, the most popular reason cited for not taking all the available paid time off is that workers don’t feel they need to.
And many people keep working when they are technically “off.” Fifty-five percent of respondents said they checked work emails and messages outside work hours “extremely often,” “often” or “sometimes.”
Employees do seem to value having paid time off available. In the Pew survey, 89 percent of all workers said it was “extremely” or “very” important that their job provide paid time off for vacations, doctor appointments and minor illnesses, with more people selecting the “extremely important” category than for employer-sponsored health insurance or an employer-sponsored retirement program.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Twitter drops the mic. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida announced his presidential campaign in a Twitter event on Wednesday, but more than 20 minutes of technical glitches disrupted the live audio event, costing it more than half its initial audience. Questions about the reliability of Twitter’s infrastructure have dogged the company for months.
Debt deal in sight. House Republicans and the White House have narrowed their differences on a deal for raising the debt limit and avoiding a government default. The stakes are high: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the government could run out of cash as soon as June 5.
A.I. shocks stocks. On Monday, an image generated by artificial intelligence that appeared to show a government building near the Pentagon on fire sent stocks on a few-minute tumble. Later in the week, the rising prominence of A.I. had the opposite effect on the share price of Nvidia, which makes computer chips used to power A.I. systems. After delivering a knockout sales outlook, it set a record in premarket trading on Thursday.

Tech rules. On Thursday, Microsoft became the latest tech company to propose regulations for artificial intelligence. It wants an “emergency brake” for systems used in critical infrastructure and labels that make it clear when an image or video was produced by a computer. Earlier in the week, Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, committed to a voluntary “A.I. pact” with other firms to develop A.I. responsibly ahead of looming regulations in Europe.

Family drama
HBO will release its last episode of “Succession” on Sunday. The show has only about eight million viewers per episode, but it has racked up publicity, awards and critical accolades, and those are valuable to HBO as it battles Hulu, Amazon and Netflix for subscribers.
Show makers like to repeat past successes. Which means they are no doubt looking for their next story about a high-stakes family business. The fictional Roy family in “Succession” bears an uncanny resemblance to the Murdoch family. But the business world has no shortage of dynasties awash in wealth, strife and fabulous clothes. Here are our suggestions.
The Arnaults. Bernard Arnault, the 74-year-old chairman of the world’s largest luxury company (and the world’s richest person), has been carefully planning for how to pass on the baton, dividing up key roles in the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton empire among his five children.
Like “Succession,” the show would have to save at least one episode for a magnificent European wedding, in this case inspired by Alexandre Arnault’s nuptials in Venice, where invited guests included Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Kanye West. A scene inspired by the glitzy reopening of Tiffany after LVMH bought the brand in a turbulent acquisition would be an excellent season finale.

The Sacklers. The family behind Purdue Pharma, whose opioid painkiller, OxyContin, initially dominated the market, has fractured during the financial and societal fallout from the company’s role in the opioid crisis. Scenes could include a withering congressional inquiry and members of the family walking into an equivalent of the Sackler wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art after it has been stripped of their name.
The Maras. The family that owns the New York Giants split into two factions. Wellington Mara, his wife and 11 children were on one side. On the other was Wellington’s nephew, Tim Mara. Show credits could feature the Venetian blind that reportedly divided their stadium luxury suites at the height of their tension. The series would end in 1995 when Tim Mara, lacking any other recourse, sold his stake in the team.
Honorable mentions: These family business dramas could sustain, if not multiple seasons of a show, at least an eight-episode mini-series:
The Safras. Joseph Safra was one of the world’s richest bankers. This year, more than two years after Joseph’s death in 2020, one of his sons, Alberto, sued two of his brothers and his mother, arguing that they were trying to push him out of his father’s company, Safra National Bank of New York.
The Kushners. A family feud between the real estate executive Charles Kushner and his brother-in-law over business helped land Charles in jail. One of his sons became the son-in-law to former President Donald Trump, then raised billions from the Saudis. The other opened a high-power venture fund and married a model.
Phrase of the week: Stealth wealth

The rich really are different. Unlike those who aspire to look luxe, the truly moneyed signal their taste subtly. Or that’s the idea underlying “stealth wealth,” the muted 2023 fashion trend exemplified by the wardrobes of “Succession.” There are no logos, flashy designs or bright colors, no cries for attention — just seemingly simple neutral and navy items, exorbitantly priced, ostensibly for the high-quality materials and craftsmanship.

If you can’t guess the designer of a $500 baseball cap or a $5,000 suit — and wouldn’t think to, frankly, because they’re plain — the wearer’s mission is accomplished. And if you can spot “quiet luxury,” as it’s also called, you’re discerning, part of the inner circle, a fraction of the tastefully fashionable few who can spot a needle in a haystack or $1,500 ballet flats by their resemblance to socks.
Presumably, you’re too cool to make the mistake of one interloper on the show, carrying a “ludicrously capacious” bag that was pricey but accidentally highlighted her outsider status with its bold Burberry trademark check and size. The stealthily wealthy may be burdened by their fortunes, but they appear to travel light, swathed in beiges, blacks and grays by designers like Ferragamo, Bottega Veneta, Loro Piana, Brunello Cucinelli, Hermes, the Row and Max Mara.
Flight delayed? Get paid: DealBook readers respond
Airlines and government officials hope to avoid flight delays and cancellations this summer as the number of air travelers threatens to eclipse prepandemic levels. In a previous newsletter, DealBook reported that President Biden wanted airlines to compensate passengers for these types of disruptions, and we asked you to share your thoughts.
In roughly half of the three dozen emails that DealBook received on the matter, readers expressed support for the measure, saying the time had come for U.S. travelers to get the same kinds of protections afforded consumers in Canada and the European Union.

About one-quarter of the DealBook readers expressed the opposite view. They said that paying late fees to travelers was excessive, and that it was better for the industry to adopt its own policies. Interestingly, readers from the pro and con camps were worried that such a measure would push up ticket prices.
Oh, and one reader had a bigger suggestion: “Invest in passenger trains. Give them priority over other trains on the rails.”

The climate activism conundrum was on full display at Shell’s shareholder meeting last week.

Toby Melville/Reuters
Has oil activism peaked?
The annual shareholder meetings of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, scheduled for Wednesday, are set to be largely sedate, as they will be held virtually. But their European rivals had raucous meetings last week, with environmental protesters storming the stage at Shell’s gathering and clashing with tear-gas-wielding police outside Total’s.
Despite the drama, however, climate-focused shareholder activists are being forced to rethink their approach, two years after the tiny hedge fund Engine No. 1 won a stunning victory over Exxon, Vivienne Walt writes for DealBook.
Activists have failed to win more than 50 percent in many key proxy votes since then. That string of disappointing results is forcing a reckoning at some of the sector’s biggest players: “In June, we’re going to revisit our strategy, and think about what’s next for the coming years,” Mark van Baal, the founder of the shareholder activist group Follow This, told DealBook.
And it comes despite major investors backing shareholder activists’ efforts: Norway’s $1.4 trillion sovereign wealth fund, for instance, has pledged to side with them on climate issues on the ballot at Exxon and Chevron.

The conundrum: how to convince investors to prioritize long-term climate risks over booming oil profits. Last year was “the year the empire struck back,” according to Mr. van Baal, as oil giants successfully argued that energy crises during a time of inflation, war and a post-pandemic travel boom trumped the climate crisis.
So far, many demands from climate groups for the industry to decarbonize have only garnered about 20 percent approval from shareholders.
Activists are weighing changes to their playbook. Mr. Van Baal outlined the following strategy:
Stay invested in the oil giants, to keep voting for climate resolutions.
Widen impact by putting pressure on investment banks and insurers that enable oil and gas projects.
Take more legal actions, building on a landmark 2021 ruling in the Netherlands, where a judge instructed Shell to accelerate its energy transition, and include tougher emissions standards in its targets. (That has drawbacks: The strategy is expensive and could take years to play out in the courts. It’s also less likely to succeed in the United States, where conservatives are pushing back against so-called environmental, social and corporate governance measures.)
Frustrations are boiling over in the activist camp, and many say change is needed. “I’ve been in the climate movement for 15 years, and I get a sense of desperation,” said Mark Raven of 350.org, an international climate activist group, some of whose members participated in last week’s protests. In particular, he added, “Younger activists are unhappy with things that have gone before.”
On Wednesday, DealBook will examine why activists have felt so dejected since Engine No. 1’s victory.

The House could vote on the agreement as soon as Wednesday, though it must first get through the chamber’s powerful Rules Committee.
Here’s what’s in the deal, which economists gave a decent grade:
Two years of federal spending limits in exchange for pushing future debt-ceiling discussions beyond the 2024 elections.
An end to the Biden administration’s freeze on student loan payments.
Stricter work requirements for public assistance programs, including food stamps, though Medicaid won’t be affected. (The requirements drew opposition from both sides of the aisle.)
A streamlined approval process for energy projects — known as permitting — through the creation of a single agency to oversee the matter. The deal also includes approval for a multibillion-dollar natural gas pipeline through West Virginia, a win for Senator Joe Manchin.
Not included in the bill are any major commitments to reduce the $31.4 trillion national debt. But The Times calculates that nondiscretionary spending cuts could save $860 billion over the next decade, and the reductions aren’t expected to inflict much pain on the economy.
The House could vote on the deal as soon as Wednesday. But some Republican members of the Rules Committee have already come out against the bill. (One, Representative Chip Roy of Texas, has argued that all nine of the committee’s Republicans must sign off on all legislation before the panel.)
There are hurdles in the Senate as well, with Republicans including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah objecting to the bill and threatening delays.

Why music stars can’t say no to the “private”
Private gigs — “privates,” in music industry lingo — are seemingly popping up everywhere, from charity galas in Manhattan to luxury hotel openings in the Persian Gulf. Bankrolled by the ultrarich and companies, these intimate star-studded performances are off-limits to the general public.
The private has become a reliable moneymaker for both chart-toppers and performers well past their prime, Evan Osnos writes in an entertaining, f-bomb-filled article in The New Yorker that opens with Flo Rida, the rapper, playing a bar mitzvah in Lincolnshire, an affluent Chicago suburb.
For years, the world of privates was dominated by aging crooners, a category known delicately as “nostalgia performers.” Jacqueline Sabec, an entertainment lawyer in San Francisco, who has negotiated many private-gig contracts, told me, “Artists used to say no to these all the time, because they just weren’t cool.”
But misgivings have receded dramatically. In January, Beyoncé did her first show in more than four years — not in a stadium of screaming fans but at a new hotel in Dubai, earning a reported $24 million for an hourlong set.
Few turn down the money from doing a private nowadays, with Jennifer Lopez, Maroon 5 and Eric Clapton all agreeing to them. Even younger artists don’t fear any stigma from what one agent said is ultimately a situation where “it’s a convention or a party, and you just happen to be making noise at one end of it.”
But some continue to resist, Mr. Osnos writes, including Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift and, “for reasons that nobody can quite clarify,” AC/DC.

2023-05-31,"FANCY BEAR GOES PHISHING: The Dark History of the Information Age, in Five Extraordinary Hacks, by Scott J. Shapiro
Don’t let the adorable title fool you: As Scott J. Shapiro acknowledges in “Fancy Bear Goes Phishing,” his new book about cybersecurity, hacking can inflict terrible harm. Shapiro is the author, with Oona A. Hathaway, of “The Internationalists” (2017), which recounts 20th-century efforts to outlaw war; among the numerous questions animating “Fancy Bear Goes Phishing” is whether hacking has opened the door to war by other means.
After all, “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear” refer to the cyberespionage units linked to Russian intelligence that gained access to the Democratic National Committee’s computer systems before the 2016 presidential election. Fancy Bear released a trove of emails that included Hillary Clinton’s closed-door speeches to Goldman Sachs and her campaign chairman’s tips for risotto.
The hack was undeniably embarrassing, and the 2016 election results ended up being so close that it’s impossible to say whether the drip-drip-drip of leaked emails was a factor in turning a roiling tide in Donald J. Trump’s favor. Not to mention that hacking into the D.N.C.’s systems “was a standard act of espionage,” Shapiro writes, and espionage happens to be legal under international law. Spies like to go phishing — so what? It’s what they do with their catch that’s the real question. In “releasing the pilfered information” for the world to see, “Fancy Bear might have engaged in an act of war.”
“Might have” — now there’s a tiny phrase with a lot of wiggle room, and Shapiro is in no hurry to pin it down. One of his themes is how hackers “exploit the duality principle,” or “the ambiguity between code and data,” both of which can be represented by numbers. I would argue that Shapiro, a professor of law and philosophy at Yale Law School, does something analogous with this book — though unlike most of the hackers he describes, he uses ambiguity to largely benevolent effect. Books are composed of words, and anyone looking for words that amount to a comprehensive guide to cybersecurity or an apocalyptic thriller about a digital Armageddon would be more efficiently served elsewhere. Shapiro might have some things to say about cybercrime and cyberwar, but what he really wants to do with his words is tell us the stories of five hacks.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The business with the D.N.C. is one. The others involve the Morris Worm, which infected the early internet in 1988 and happened to be created by the son of the chief scientist for computer security at the National Security Agency; the 1990s malware handiwork of a Bulgarian hacker known as the Dark Avenger; the 2005 hack into Paris Hilton’s cellphone by a 16-year-old boy; and the “Mirai botnet,” a networked supercomputer developed in 2016 by three teenagers that gathered strength by secretly conscripting so-called smart appliances, like security cameras and toasters.
Image
Shapiro himself started out as a computer science major in college and had a stint as a tech entrepreneur, constructing databases for clients that included Time-Life Books. He didn’t hack his first computer until he was 52, though he made up for lost time by hacking the Yale Law School website, “a feat that my dean did not appreciate.” Shapiro is funny and unflaggingly fascinated by his subject, luring even the nonspecialist into technical descriptions of coding by teasing out connections between computer programming and, say, the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise. He offers Rousseau as an illuminating guide to the early days of the internet. A single paragraph moves nimbly from Putin to Descartes to “The Matrix.”
The technological element is just one half of the hacking problem, amounting to what Shapiro calls the “downcode.” The other half is the “upcode,” which refers to everything human: laws, norms, the cognitive biases that allow clever humans to think they can get by with poor cyberhygiene. Shapiro argues that technical fixes are important, but they can only protect us so much. Downcode is downstream from upcode. “Cybersecurity is not a primarily technological problem that requires a primarily engineering solution,” he writes. “It is a human problem that requires an understanding of human behavior.”
And such human behavior can change, depending not only on incentives and punishments, but also on lessons learned. One virus that made the rounds in 2000 was ILOVEYOU, sent by email attachment. In addition to exploiting serious technical vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s operating system, it also “exploited our ‘love upcode,’” Shapiro explains. “People want to be loved.” No doubt people still want to be loved, but 23 years later the infected email looks so obviously suspicious that it reads like a parody of an infected email. Most regular computer users are probably too hardened and cynical now to open an attachment in an email that awkwardly declares: “kindly check the LOVELETTER coming from me.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
So over time we build up defenses by becoming less innocent — less prone to clicking weird links, less disposed to handing over our Social Security numbers, less inclined to thinking a good password is 12345. But as Shapiro shows, regulation can still leave even the careful computer user more vulnerable than necessary. The impenetrable legalese of endless licensing agreements has allowed software companies to escape liability in ways that, say, the manufacturer of a defective toaster could not: “None of us read the licensing agreements because (1) they are inscrutable to nonlawyers; (2) they are inscrutable even to lawyers; (3) we are impatient; and (4) we have no choice.”
Besides, Shapiro adds, we now live in a world of “surveillance capitalism,” meaning that much of our data is stored and sold by corporations. We entrust them with highly personal information and assume that they will do everything they can to protect that information from hacking. Yet the legal consequences faced by corporations for data breaches “are laughably slight.”
Stiffer penalties could help; better legislation, too. Still, Shapiro also counsels against succumbing to the belief that there’s a silver bullet out there that will stop our cybertroubles once and for all. “We don’t need perfect security,” he writes, “just reasonable precautions.” Readers who start this book assuming they will be handed a more sweeping conclusion will find that their expectations have been (entertainingly) subverted: In other words, they’ve been hacked.

What to watch in today’s jobs report
Market futures are looking up today after the Senate approved the bipartisan debt limit deal, averting a national fiscal crisis. (More on that below.)
Now investors are turning their focus to other looming concerns: worries over inflation, interest rates and recession, with a key reading on the U.S. economy due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern this morning.
All eyes will be on the May jobs report. Hiring has slowed in recent months, but the unemployment rate still stands at a 53-year low despite a wave of layoffs in the technology, media and financial sectors.
Analysts say the labor market over all appears to be returning to its prepandemic state. “The Great Resignation is over, with quits and hiring slowing dramatically and layoffs higher than the last few years of the 2010s,” Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote to clients.

The headline figure to watch today is 190,000. That’s how many new hires were made last month, according to economists polled by Dow Jones, down from 253,000 in April.
But it’s worth remembering that economists have consistently underestimated the strength of the labor market: The number of hires has come in above expectations in 13 of the past 16 months. (Incidentally, Comerica’s forecast is below consensus, at 175,000 new hires.)
Pay attention to wages, too. Data released this week by ADP, the payroll processor, showed that wages rose on average last month by 6.5 percent on an annualized basis, a sign that workers still have plenty of buying power, which could keep prices high. (Speaking of which, keep an eye out for the latest Consumer Price Index data due out on June 13.)
Fed officials will look for signs that inflation could tick up again. A hot jobs number today could influence the central bank’s interest rate policy in the second half of the year, and that uncertainty has been hanging over the markets.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The Senate passes the debt limit deal. Lawmakers approved the agreement, 63-36, ending weeks of political fighting just days before the Treasury Department was forecast to run out of cash. The measure now heads to President Biden’s desk; he’s expected to address the nation tonight.
A top House Republican accuses the F.T.C.’s chair of “abuse of power.” Representative James Comer of Kentucky, who leads the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into Lina Khan, citing concerns about her expansive approach to antitrust regulation. The inquiry marks the latest pushback against the Biden administration’s tougher stance on mergers and acquisitions.
The judge overseeing Disney’s lawsuit against Ron DeSantis recuses himself. Judge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida reversed course after discovering that a “third-degree relative” owned some Disney stock. The media giant sued DeSantis, Florida’s governor, in April over a dispute about oversight of the special tax district that encompasses Disney World.
A Meta privacy lawsuit is thrown out. A judge in the District of Columbia yesterday dismissed a case against the tech giant, which was accused of deceiving consumers by improperly sharing their data with third parties. The decision is a rare legal victory for Facebook’s parent company, which faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny around the world following the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal that exposed how user data can leak and spread.

A veteran activist investor steps down
The changing of the guard that has swept across Wall Street has reached one of its most notable activist investment firms: Ed Garden is stepping down as chief investment officer of Trian.
Mr. Garden co-founded the firm in 2005, with the veteran financier Nelson Peltz (his father-in-law) and Peter May. Trian has become one of the most powerful activist investors around, shaking up corporate titans like DuPont, General Electric, H. J. Heinz and Procter & Gamble. Most recently, the firm waged a short-lived fight against Disney.
Mr. Garden played a key role in Trian’s campaigns, which usually involved the firm producing detailed white papers outlining its recommended changes in strategy. He has also served as Trian’s representative on boards, including at G.E., Family Dollar Stores and Wendy’s. Such was his importance that over the years some on Wall Street had expected him to eventually succeed Mr. Peltz as Trian’s leader.

Trian is elevating its next generation of leaders. The firm will appoint Josh Frank and Matt Peltz, a son of Nelson Peltz, as co-C.I.O.s, while Brian Baldwin will become head of research. (Nelson Peltz will stay on as C.E.O. and Mr. May will remain president.)
It’s the latest effort at succession planning on Wall Street, following moves in recent years by Apollo, Carlyle, KKR and others. Among activist investors, Carl Icahn brought his son Brett back to his investment vehicle in 2020, a move that watchers have said anointed the younger Icahn as the firm’s next leader.
Corporate America scores at the Supreme Court
Two rulings by the Supreme Court yesterday represented wins for companies that could have significant implications for businesses going public and dealing with striking workers.
The justices unanimously rejected a shareholder’s case against Slack, which accused the workplace messaging app of misleading investors ahead of its 2019 direct listing. The investor, Fiyyaz Pirani, said the company did not properly disclose relevant information about matters like service outages and competition it faces from Teams, Microsoft’s rival platform.

Slack said the lawsuit should be dismissed because Mr. Pirani bought unregistered shares that were not covered by the prospectus under securities laws. Only S.E.C.-registered shares are issued in accordance with a company’s prospectus. But in a direct listing, an alternative to a conventional initial public offering, both types of shares — including those already acquired by employees and private investors, like Mr. Pirani’s — begin trading at the same time.
The justices rejected Mr. Pirani’s argument that direct listings require rethinking securities rules and sent him back to a lower court to prove his shares were registered. The decision restricts the pool of shareholders who can easily sue over misleading registrations.
Some business leaders welcomed the ruling. Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of the crypto exchange Coinbase (which is fighting with the S.E.C. over cryptocurrency regulations) argued on Twitter that the decision was a “warning to agencies and others that the federal securities laws are not just whatever they want them to be — limits imposed by Congress matter.”
The court also made it easier for employers to sue striking workers. In a separate case, the justices backed a concrete company that accused workers of deliberately causing damage to the company during industrial action.
The 8-1 ruling overturned a Washington State court decision that the loss was incidental and protected under the National Labor Relations Act. Some legal experts said the case would discourage workers from striking.

Deal making crawls along
The slowdown in mergers and acquisitions that has plagued Wall Street since last year shows little sign of letting up, according to new data. And that could pose more consequences for the deal makers who profit from putting those deals together.
Announced M.&A. worldwide hit $1.07 trillion through the end of May, according to Refinitiv. That’s down 42 percent year-on-year and one of the slowest starts to a year over the past decade. (The only worse showing was in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, when deal activity had failed to cross $1 trillion by this point.)

The number of transactions is also down 14 percent from the same time in 2022, plummeting to a three-year low of 21,301.
All of this is despite the announcement of some big takeovers this year, including Pfizer’s planned $43 billion acquisition of the cancer-drug specialist Seagen and Newmont’s $19 billion bid for Newcrest, a rival miner.
That dearth of deals is spurring layoffs, as banks including Lazard and Morgan Stanley have slashed jobs to reduce costs. John Waldron, Goldman Sachs’s president, said at a conference yesterday that his firm was planning more cuts — expected to affect senior executives like managing directors — because of the “tougher environment.”

2023-06-03,"A string of challenges to Section 230 — the law that shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content — have failed over the last several weeks. Most recently, the Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to review a suit about exploitative content on Reddit. But the debate over what responsibility tech companies have for harmful content is far from settled — and generative artificial intelligence tools like the ChatGPT chatbot could open a new line of questions.
Does Section 230 apply to generative A.I.? The law’s 1996 drafters told DealBook that it does not. “We set out to protect hosting,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. Platforms are immune only to suits about material created by others, not their own work. “If you are partly complicit in content creation, you don’t get the shield,” agreed Chris Cox, a former Republican representative from California. But they admit that these distinctions, which once seemed simple, are already becoming more difficult to make.
What about A.I. search engines? Typically, search engines are considered vehicles for information rather than content creators, and search companies have benefited from Section 230 protection. Chatbots generate content, and they are most likely beyond protection. But tech giants like Microsoft and Google are integrating chat and search, complicating matters. “If some search engines start to look more like chat output, the lines will be blurred,” Wyden said.
A deadly recipe? Generative A.I. tools have already been used to make intentionally harmful content. And hallucinations — the falsehoods that generative A.I. tools create (like court cases that never existed) — are a significant problem. If a user prompts an A.I. for cocktail instructions and it offers a poisonous concoction, the algorithm operator’s liability is obvious, said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and a Section 230 expert.

But most situations won’t be that clear-cut, and that poses a risk, Goldman said. He fears that anger over immunity for social media platforms threatens nuanced debate about the next generation of tech development.
“The blossoming of A.I. comes at one of the most precarious times amid a maturing tech backlash,” Goldman said. “We need some kind of immunity for people who make the tools,” he added. “Without it, we’re never going to see the full potential of A.I.” — Ephrat Livni
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Elon Musk receives a hero’s welcome in China. The Tesla chief was hailed on Chinese social media as a “global idol” during his visit this week to the country, where he met with government ministers and visited the Tesla’s Shanghai factory. Musk reportedly also had kind words for his hosts: Government readouts of his meetings with Beijing ministers said he had described the U.S. and Chinese economies as “conjoined twins” and opposed political efforts to decouple them.
Billy Joel is movin’ out (of Madison Square Garden). The singer announced this week that he will finish a 10-year stay at Madison Square Garden in July 2024. The series of more than 100 shows crossed its $200 million threshold in March. James Dolan, the C.E.O of the Garden’s parent company, said the run had “made history” for both the venue and the music industry. Or, perhaps more simply: Joel was a big shot.

“Ketatations” in the workplace. Some executives have embraced the anesthetic ketamine to improve professional performance or foster team bonding. “We put them on yoga mats in the room, we have a prescription from a doctor, and we have a 45-minute experience together,” Kaia Roman, who has led “ketatations” (ketamine + meditation) since the pandemic, told Bloomberg. Others prefer a more aggressive way to relax: Mark Zuckerberg recently completed “the Murph Challenge,” which consists of a mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats and another mile run — all while wearing a 20-pound vest. He said he had done it in 40 minutes.

Matter of debate: ‘greedflation’
General inflation slowed for the 10th straight month in April, but many companies are still raising prices. Why? Some economists blame “greedflation,” “excuseflation” or a “price-price spiral,” whereby businesses use inflationary events like the pandemic, the Ukraine war and soaring energy prices as an excuse to make big price increases that more than cover their higher costs. The idea is that customers are more accepting of price increases when they know inflation is historically high, so companies are taking the opportunity to raise prices as much as they can. But not everyone is convinced, and some point to a host of other postpandemic economic trends as the real culprit. Here are two views.
Greedflation is to blame. Despite expectations that net profit margins would decline this year, they have increased at the average company in the S&P 500, according to data from FactSet.
“What we see in many cases is that volumes are going down, while prices are going up and profit margins are going up,” said Isabella Weber, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who pioneered the theory.
She pointed to Starbucks as an extreme example of what she calls “sellers’ inflation.” In 2020, when the pandemic shut down demand for coffee shops, basic supply-and-demand laws suggested that Starbucks would lower the price of coffee to entice people back to its stores. Instead, Weber said, “prices actually were going up.”

Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City said corporate profits had contributed to inflation in 2021, though their contribution fell in 2022, which is consistent with what happened in previous economic recoveries.
Greedflation is not to blame. Customers who benefited from stimulus checks, low interest rates, investment gains and other factors were in a good financial position coming out of the pandemic. Their willingness to spend more is what’s mostly fueling inflation, some analysts say.
“It seems to me that many telling the profit story forget that households have to actually spend money for the story to hold,” David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at the right-leaning Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a former economist for the Treasury Department, told The Times this week. “And once you look at the huge surge in spending, it becomes inescapable to me where the causality lies.”
In any case, conditions for greedflation could be waning. Supply chain disruptions and other inflationary pressures are easing, making it harder for companies to blame inflation elsewhere for raising prices. “Some firms are claiming ‘general inflation pressures’ as being behind their price increases,” said Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS, “but that is far less convincing, and consumers are less willing to accept it.”
Weber warns, however, that another inflation-causing crisis could pop up at any time, and “firms have now learned this playbook.”

The Ted Lasso way
“Ted Lasso,” the saccharine story of an apparently clueless American who is appointed to run a British soccer team, ended this week. And while Lasso’s journey from barely knowing the rules to turning a group of misfits into a top team is not particularly realistic, management experts say some of his coaching strategies really are.
DealBook has picked out four management lessons from the fictional coach from Kansas that might apply to the real world. Warning: They contain spoilers.
The outsider sees things that others do not. Lasso is initially portrayed as a naïve bumpkin with little understanding of the sport, his team or the country he’s living in. But that is the foundation of his success, said Allyson Stewart-Allen, C.E.O. of International Marketing Partners and an expert on cross-cultural management. “He brings a lack of self-consciousness in wanting to ask questions others might think are facile,” she told DealBook, adding that her American clients who are expanding in Europe do exactly what Lasso does. “Ask lots of questions, be open to new ideas, and experiment.”
Culture trumps strategy. Any team that is on the same wavelength is obviously more likely to thrive, a view famously championed by management thinkers like Peter Drucker. Lasso’s first task was to understand the culture of the organization he has taken over and then mold it in his image. Once he achieved this, he shifted to identifying the strengths and weaknesses of his players and coaches, and figuring out how to motivate them. That should be the goal of every good manager.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Serious strategic change takes time. Most executives, especially those who run public companies, are under immense pressure to deliver quickly. Sometimes that’s justified, but sometimes boards can be too quick to change a C.E.O. without providing the necessary support. Lasso had three years with little real threat of being fired. That gave him time to understand the game (by the final episode, he had learned what the offside rule is), the culture of the club and how to make it all work. It was only midway through his last season that he discovered his sporting vision — “total football” — that he used to turn his team of losers into winners.
“Meaning matters more than means,” Bruce Feiler, the author of “The Search: Finding Meaningful Work in a Post-Career World,” told CNBC this week. Younger workers increasingly put a priority on work-life balance and personal fulfillment over money in their careers. On the show, Lasso himself best embodied that trait by walking away from the job after finishing second rather than sticking around and trying to win it all again. Even though he finally cracked the sport, he returned to Kansas to be closer to his family. “He shows vulnerability,” Stewart-Allen said. “He cries. He has panic attacks. He’s not perfect, and he doesn’t try to hide that. I think that is very realistic and endearing and builds empathy with people.”
Your thoughts on vacation
Last week, we wrote about a recent Pew survey that found almost half of Americans do not use all of their paid time off, and we asked you for your thoughts. A lot of you cited the same reasons as respondents to the survey for not using all of your time — banking time to use in an emergency, fearing that taking vacation will make you vulnerable during a layoff or worrying that work will accumulate to stressful levels while you’re away. We also heard from many readers who do use all of their paid time off. Here are a few of your reasons:
Quilvio wrote that he is in his early 20s, younger than most of his co-workers, and that “generationally, we have different mind-set around P.T.O. and work.” He added, “I think as long as I’m getting the work done, the days (and hours) I work aren’t as important.”
Another reader, who asked not to be named, wrote that she used to work at a prestigious New York City law firm where most senior attorneys did not take all of their paid vacation days. Talking with them about their weekend leisure activities, she realized why: “It dawned on me (silly woman) — they have WIVES AND SERVANTS who do all the nonwork work for them! So they have time and energy to unwind on both evenings AND weekends. They are not making calls to set up doctor appointments for their kids (or, likely, for themselves either), they are not making dinner after work every night, they do not attend P.T.A. meetings, they are not burdened with the zillion daily decisions and tasks of keeping a household going.”
Stephanie, a director at a hospital, said she granted whatever time her employees needed. “It’s a retention tool,” she wrote. “We have a high-performing team. If I take care of my managers, they take care of their staff. The staff then are better able to care for their patients.”

2023-06-05,"The S&P 500, the index obsessed over by investors, executives and government officials, on Monday came close to finishing 20 percent above its lowest level of 2022, a gain that some on Wall Street see as the start of a bull market and a new phase of investing exuberance.
The index fluctuated around the threshold on Monday, moving above it multiple times, before ending 0.2 percent lower for the day, which put it at 19.5 percent above its October low.
Still, the move underscores the strong recovery in the stock market since fears of high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession had steadily pushed the index down from its peak in early 2022. The S&P 500 fell into a bear market — which is defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from an index’s high — in June of that year, and continued to slide until hitting a low in October.
The terms “bull” and “bear” are shorthand for excitement or fear among investors about the prospects for public companies. But while investors tend to agree on how to mark the start of a bear market, there’s less consensus on how to define the start of a bull market, especially when the concerns that initially dragged stocks lower still linger.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
One rule of thumb is that a new bull market is confirmed when an index sets a new high after rising from a bear-market low. By that measure, the S&P 500 is still more than 10 percent short.
But some investors say it’s simpler to look at any gain of 20 percent or more in a broad-based index like the S&P 500 as an important milestone, with the measurement taken at the end of the trading day. More than $15 trillion in investment assets are benchmarked or indexed to the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index.
“We’re not in a horrible spot,” said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Société Générale. “There are recession risks for sure, but we have to see how those materialize over several months and into next year. So technically this is a bull market.”
Still, a rise of 20 percent from a low is, mathematically, less substantial than a fall of 20 percent from a high. Other investors prefer an assessment that involves a wider look at investor sentiment, economic growth and the market’s direction.
“If a stock goes from $10 to $5 and then rallies to $6, it’s not in a new bull market,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. “Defining a bull or bear market, however it’s done, should be done via a broad look at the market.”

The recent rally in the S&P 500 has been led by a small group of tech stocks propelled by enthusiasm about the profit-generating possibilities of artificial intelligence, especially for those at the heart of its development and the production of hardware needed to power it. Nvidia, the chip maker, has come to symbolize this newfound enthusiasm for A.I. because its semiconductors are used in the technology. The company has rallied almost 170 percent this year — gains that have brought its valuation close to $1 trillion.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
The average individual stock in the S&P 500 has risen less than 3 percent this year, market data through Friday’s close shows, compared with a gain of over 11 percent for the index as a whole. Some 90 percent of the index’s rise is due to bumper gains for just seven of the biggest companies: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
Apple rose 2.2 percent by early afternoon on Monday, briefly marking a new high for the company, before sliding to end 0.8 percent lower, weighing on the index.
The S&P 500 also tracks only the largest companies listed in the United States. Smaller companies are generally more exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, because larger firms generate a sizable share of revenue overseas.
The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller public companies, has recently recorded more modest gains than its big-company counterpart. The index fell over 30 percent from its peak in November 2021 to its low last June. Since then, the index has risen about 9 percent. On Monday, the index fell 1.3 percent after weaker-than-expected economic data on the services sector.

In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward big tech companies, has risen more than 26 percent this year alone. Yet it remains almost 20 percent below its previous peak, hit in late 2021.
“I think the 20 percent rule has been an easy one for folks to follow,” said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Unfortunately, some of these bear-market rallies are triggering that threshold, which we view as a false signal.”
For many investors, the bumper returns in the stock market haven’t been reflected in their portfolios’ performance. That’s because with so much concern about a possible recession, fund managers are largely holding more cash and hedging their holdings against the risk of a precipitous fall, forgoing gains in favor of greater safety.
Just over 27 percent of funds tracked by Morningstar that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 are beating the index this year, compared with almost 52 percent last year and an average of 40 percent since 2000.
Hedge funds and other leveraged investors especially have built up big bets on the S&P 500 falling, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
“Everyone has been so defensive,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. “There is a lot of cash on the sidelines, and so this is actually quite painful for a lot of fund managers.”"

2023-06-07,"Apple on Monday announced an updated autocorrect function that aims to more accurately reflect users’ intended word choices, pleasing customers whose attempts to swear in texts have long been replaced with “duck” or “ducking” (and freeing innocent waterfowl from their unfortunate association with an obscenity).
“In those moments where you just want to type a ducking word, well, the keyboard will learn it, too,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president for software engineering.
The update was announced on the first day of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, where the company also introduced its Vision Pro headset. The company said the new keyboard features would be available as part of the iOS 17 software package expected to arrive later this year.
Autocorrect will use a type of neural network called a transformer model to recognize iPhone users’ most frequently-typed words and offer predictive text, according to Apple. Transformer models, which are at the heart of artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT, analyze large amounts of text for patterns.

“Ducking” had become such a recognizable error caused by the iPhone’s autocorrect function that The Wall Street Journal conducted an interview with the feature’s creator, Ken Kocienda, at a duck farm.
That system drew upon both a “static dictionary” of common words and proper nouns as well as a “dynamic dictionary” of words that each user typed often, Mr. Kocienda said. But it also did not correct close misspellings of curse words, he said, with the goal of preventing users from accidentally inserting vulgarity into their messages.
The update will allow iMessage corrections to better consider a word’s context in a sentence, said Yulan He, a professor of natural language processing at King’s College London whose given name is usually changed by iMessage to “Tulane.”
Previously, autocorrect matched the spelling of each word, in isolation, against the words in its dictionaries. “Now, when they replace a word, they would ensure the replaced word will still maintain the original meaning of the sentence,” Professor He said. “That’s kind of a key difference.”
Autocorrect, which was developed in the 1980s to accompany word processing programs, has been creating problems for as long as it has been solving them.

In 2014, Naomi Campbell congratulated “malaria” on winning the Nobel Peace Prize. (She might have meant “Malala.”) According to Wired, employees at Goldman Sachs were upset that Microsoft Word corrected their company’s name to incorporate a profanity. The phrase “autocorrect made me do it” has become a way of explaining away embarrassing substitutions such as “sex” instead of “sec.”
Jillian Madison, who curated a website of autocorrect blunders, released the book “Damn You, Autocorrect!” in 2011. “If you say, you know, ‘I’m going to run and pick up the kids,’ it often turns into, ‘I’m going to run and pick up the LSD,’” she told NPR.
In Apple’s presentation, Mr. Federighi said that the new system would make autocorrect “more accurate than ever.” The update will also allow users to tap an autocorrected word to revert it back to what they had typed."
2023-06-08,"With Gov. Doug Burgum’s money and his family’s vision, Fargo, N.D., has undoubtedly changed in recent decades. Broadway, its main drag, is packed with restaurants, cafes, retailers and offices lovingly converted from old factories.
Parking lots have been turned into public parks. A warehouse saved from the wrecking ball now houses North Dakota State University’s architecture and arts program. With a population of nearly 127,000 — 16 percent of North Dakota’s total population — the largest city for hundreds of miles is growing, in size and diversity, with a liberal tilt.
But as a base for a presidential run, Fargo is still the smallest of towns, closer to Winnipeg, in Canada, than to Minneapolis, the nearest American metropolis. The hamlet of Arthur, where Mr. Burgum grew up and where his family’s prosperous, century-old grain elevator dominates the flat landscape, is still more removed from the nation’s political currents. Even North Dakotans who express admiration for their governor’s wealth, business acumen and energy are baffled by his suddenly lofty political ambitions.
“He’s a long shot, for sure,” said Brad Moen, 69, of Jamestown, N.D., who has known Mr. Burgum for 60 years and traveled 100 miles for his presidential introduction on Wednesday. “California, New York, Ohio, Florida — they’re the big dogs, not North Dakota.”

But first he’ll face the other new entrants in a G.O.P. field that as of this week seems largely set.
Former Vice President Mike Pence has piety and consistent conservatism to remind evangelical Christians of what brought them to politics in the first place. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, has his tell-it-like-it-is pugilism, as the only candidate willing to take on Donald J. Trump. Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina, has hope and optimism. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, has Trumpism without Trump.
Yet all these options seem to have done nothing but carve up the Republican primary electorate that is not with Mr. Trump into ever more slender slivers — leaving the former president’s inviolable piece of the pie looking larger and larger with every new candidate.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That has North Dakotans asking the same question that many other Americans are: What do these candidates really want — a cabinet post in a second Trump administration, a higher national profile for a future presidential bid, a vanity project after a long career? Mr. Pence is seen by many Republican voters as the ultimate traitor, the man they wrongly believe could have given Mr. Trump a victory in 2020 and declined. Mr. Christie is viewed with hostility by many Republicans because of his outspoken contempt for Mr. Trump — and with suspicion by anti-Trump Republicans because of his loyalty to him until now.
As for Mr. Burgum, who knows?
“I think that he is genuinely thinking this is a vehicle for promoting North Dakota,” Dustin Gawrylow, a conservative political commentator and activist in the state, said of Mr. Burgum. Or, he suggested, “he may have his eye on a cabinet position.”
Tony S. Grindberg, a utility executive and former state senator, was at Mr. Burgum’s rally on Wednesday working through how the governor could pursue his quixotic presidential run and prepare to seek a third term in Bismarck.
“Technically, he can,” he concluded, hopefully.

His story is out of central casting: the son of a tiny town who as a teenager lost his father, and then channeled a natural entrepreneurial spirit into enterprises that included chimney sweeping, a business software empire and venture capital — all within the state lines of North Dakota.

Mr. Burgum’s status as a billionaire traces back to Microsoft, which bought his company, Great Plains Software, in 2001 in a $1.1 billion stock deal that made him one of the richest men in the Dakotas. All that money will give him staying power in the race, but it cannot get him the 40,000 individual donors or the 1 percent in the polls that he needs to qualify for the Republican debate stage. It won’t make him a household name, and among some of the Republican faithful, it could conjure feverish images of Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder who features in many of the most outlandish far-right conspiracy theories.

Even North Dakotans are not sure what to make of their governor. They can squint to see the politician they want to see.
Jonathan Melgaard, 29, sees Mr. Burgum as the essence of nonpartisan leadership, an effective entrepreneur and bridge builder inspiring enough to lure him back from Colorado, where he worked for the Aspen Institute to help build a progressive, forward-looking Fargo. To voters like Mr. Melgaard, Mr. Burgum is the investor who promised to make oil-rich North Dakota “carbon neutral,” in part by backing an ambitious pipeline to bring carbon dioxide produced as an unwanted byproduct of ethanol from around the Midwest to the absorbent 300-foot-thick Broom Creek sandstone 7,000 feet under North Dakota’s surface.

Mr. Moen waved off all that talk of carbon capture and electric vehicles and latched on to Mr. Burgum’s promise to bolster the state’s abundant traditional energy sources, oil and coal.
Outside Mr. Burgum’s event, Shelly Reilly, 59, joined a small group of protesters determined to discount the governor’s nonpartisan business pitch and emphasize the bills he has actually signed, which banned gender transition care for minors, abortion and the discussion of L.G.B.T.Q. issues in elementary schools.
“I know people who have left because of him,” she said. “They’re leaving in droves.”
Even Mr. Burgum doesn’t seem to know quite what to do with his record. He ran on innovation, vowing to diversify the state’s economy beyond agriculture and oil by expanding the technology sector and appealing to educated professionals with distance learning and thriving cities.
Fargo shows that promise, but social policy will be Mr. Burgum’s legacy. In a recent interview with Joel Heitkamp, a popular radio host and the brother of former Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, Mr. Burgum acknowledged that the six-week exception for rape and incest in the new abortion ban would be so short that a woman might not know in time whether she was pregnant, but he said that if he had vetoed it, the legislature would have overridden him. He said the same thing about the anti-L.G.B.T.Q. rights bills, even as he insisted most of them codified what was happening in the state anyway.

“He was the most exciting person to become governor in my lifetime,” said Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat who was North Dakota’s at-large House member for 18 years before the rising tide of Republicanism swept him out. He voted for Mr. Burgum, Mr. Pomeroy said, “but it’s been years of unspectacular leadership out of the governor’s office.” He added, “He’s been somewhat captive to the crazy legislature.”

The governorship was Mr. Burgum’s first elective office. He spent freely to win his race in 2016 and then spent freely to bolster his support.
In 2020, Mr. Burgum clashed with the state House Appropriations Committee chairman, Jeff Delzer, especially over the governor’s prized project, a new Theodore Roosevelt presidential library near the Burgum ranch in Medora, N.D. After the conflict, Mr. Burgum funded a primary challenger running as a “Trump Republican” against Mr. Delzer.
The challenger, David Andahl, died of Covid-19 before his name could be taken off the ballot — and won. Then local officials reappointed Mr. Delzer to the seat.
The carbon dioxide pipeline, bankrolled by the oil and gas billionaire Harold Hamm, has angered activists on the right and the left.

Yet Mr. Burgum’s rally on Wednesday was packed with past and present elected officials.
“There are a lot of legislators that outright fear what Doug Burgum will do to them,” Mr. Gawrylow said. “Burgum has shown he is not afraid to put his money where his mouth is, and that is scary.”
Mr. Heitkamp takes Mr. Burgum’s presidential ambitions at face value. He acknowledged the rampant speculation that the governor doesn’t actually believe he can beat Mr. Trump to the nomination and then secure the White House. But Mr. Heitkamp thinks Mr. Burgum is a believer.
“He’s a nerd, and he looks in the mirror and sees something that others don’t,” Mr. Heitkamp, a former Democratic state senator, said. “When he shaves in the morning, he sees a president.”"

2023-06-11,"For decades, Silicon Valley anticipated the moment when a new technology would come along and change everything. It would unite human and machine, probably for the better but possibly for the worse, and split history into before and after.
The name for this milestone: the Singularity.
It could happen in several ways. One possibility is that people would add a computer’s processing power to their own innate intelligence, becoming supercharged versions of themselves. Or maybe computers would grow so complex that they could truly think, creating a global brain.
In either case, the resulting changes would be drastic, exponential and irreversible. A self-aware superhuman machine could design its own improvements faster than any group of scientists, setting off an explosion in intelligence. Centuries of progress could happen in years or even months. The Singularity is a slingshot into the future.
Artificial intelligence is roiling tech, business and politics like nothing in recent memory. Listen to the extravagant claims and wild assertions issuing from Silicon Valley, and it seems the long-promised virtual paradise is finally at hand.
Sundar Pichai, Google’s usually low-key chief executive, calls artificial intelligence “more profound than fire or electricity or anything we have done in the past.” Reid Hoffman, a billionaire investor, says, “The power to make positive change in the world is about to get the biggest boost it’s ever had.” And Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates proclaims A.I. “will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care and communicate with each other.”
A.I. is Silicon Valley’s ultimate new product rollout: transcendence on demand.

Trump fights charges with politics
Donald Trump, who last week became the first former president to face federal charges, arrived in Florida before his scheduled first appearance tomorrow in federal court on criminal charges of mishandling sensitive national security documents and seeking to thwart the government’s efforts to reclaim them.
My colleagues reported that Trump is planning to spend tonight at his Doral resort in Miami, where he and his legal team will conduct last-minute interviews with lawyers to represent him in the case. (One of his current attorneys could be a key witness.)
His defense against the federal prosecution, which is likely to play out during his campaign for president, is likely to focus more on the politics of charging a former president than on the facts of the case. In recent days, Trump has been quick to place blame for his indictment on Democrats, the “Deep State,” and the Justice Department — which he described as “a sick nest of people that needs to be cleaned out immediately.”
Some of Trump’s allies have taken the political attacks even further, portraying the charges as an act of war and calling for violent retribution. It is unclear, in the end, what a jury of Floridians will make of it all; even some reliable Republicans there have complicated feelings about the former president.

About 60 percent of U.S. voters do not have a four-year college degree, and they live disproportionately in swing states. As a result, these voters — often described as the American working class — are crucial to winning elections. Yet many of them are deeply skeptical of today’s Democratic Party.
Republicans retook control of the House last year by winning most districts with below-median incomes. In nearly 20 Western and Southern states, Democrats are virtually shut out of statewide offices largely because of their weakness among the white working class. Since 2018, the party has also lost ground with Black, Asian and especially Latino voters.
Unless the party improves its standing with blue-collar voters, “there’s no way for progressive Democrats to advance their agenda in the Senate,” according to a study that the Center for Working-Class Politics, a left-leaning research group, released this morning.
The class inversion of American politics — with most professionals supporting Democrats and more working-class people backing Republicans — is one of the most consequential developments in American life (and, as regular readers know, a continuing theme of this newsletter).

Today, I’ll be writing about what Democrats might do about the problem, focusing on a new YouGov poll, conducted as part of the Center for Working-Class Politics study. In an upcoming newsletter, I’ll examine the issue from a conservative perspective and specifically how Republicans might alter their economic agenda to better serve their new working-class base.
A key point is that even modest shifts in the working-class vote can decide elections. If President Biden wins 50 percent of the non-college vote next year, he will almost certainly be re-elected. If he wins only 45 percent, he will probably lose."

The Fed is not expected to raise rates for the first time in over a year.

The Fed looks poised to pause
S&P 500 futures are up on Wednesday as investors bet that the Fed will not change its prime lending rate, thanks to an array of unexpectedly positive economic data.
If the central bank moves as expected, it would break a streak of 10 consecutive rate increases, back to March of 2022 — the Fed’s most aggressive pace since the 1980s. That said, many expect the decision on Wednesday to represent a pause, not a reversal, of a hawkish anti-inflation policy.
What Fed officials say may matter more than what they do. The central bank’s chair, Jay Powell, is expected to suggest at his post-meeting news conference on Wednesday that he isn’t done raising rates. That’s in part because the economy is still running hotter than expected: Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index report put “core” inflation — excluding energy and food prices — well above the Fed’s 2 percent target.
“We think Powell will deliver the message that they have more to do to bring inflation down, and that they are willing to do it,” Andrew Patterson, a senior economist at Vanguard, told DealBook. Mr. Patterson believes that the Fed is planning at least one more rate increase this year.

(Some don’t even think the Fed should pause: Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz and a critic of the central bank’s handling of inflation, argued this week that recent figures support another rate increase.)
Still, stocks are booming. The S&P 500 is in bull market territory, helped by the runaway performance of megacap tech stocks. Analysts speak of a “fear of missing out” vibe, akin to the rally of late 2020 and 2021. According to Morgan Stanley, retail investors binged on U.S. stocks in May, particularly big-name tech stocks, in the biggest one-month buying spree since 2010.
That leaves investors hoping that Mr. Powell doesn’t crash their party.

Janet Yellen says that a U.S.-China decoupling would be a “mistake.” The Treasury secretary testified before House lawmakers that an economic relationship with China remains critical. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting Beijing next week.

Europe wants to get tough on A.I.
European Union lawmakers just approved a first-in-the-world set of proposed rules meant to regulate artificial intelligence. The stakes are high: As the corporate world rushes to embrace tools like generative A.I., governments are scrambling to put up guardrails.
The A.I. Act would impose first-of-their-kind limits. Introduced in 2021, before ChatGPT was online, its proposed requirements include publicly available summaries of the copyrighted material used to train A.I. systems; safeguards to prevent generative A.I. from producing illegal content; and bans on live facial recognition.

Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s competition chief, said this morning that she considered discrimination by A.I. a bigger risk from the technology than human extinction.
But it’s worth remembering that the proposal will still be subject to further negotiations with other European bodies, including national parliaments, before becoming law.
Tech giants have sought to shape the E.U.’s efforts. Sam Altman, the C.E.O. of the ChatGPT parent OpenAI, recently warned that his company could leave Europe if the A.I. Act was too tough. (He then backtracked.) Other top executives, including Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, have pledged to help the E.U. devise its rules.
Europe is ahead of the pack. While Washington policymakers agree that A.I. regulations are needed, there’s no bill on the horizon. That said, the White House has published best-practice guidelines for how to test A.I. systems.

China is also seeking to catch up — with the particular goal of making A.I. tools subject to the same strict censorship it applies to other internet services. Beijing plans to have draft rules ready for lawmakers this year.

Marcelo Claure’s next big move
Marcelo Claure, the former chief operating officer of SoftBank, will announce his next big move on Wednesday: a new Latin America-focused growth equity firm called Bicycle Capital that is backed by Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund. The firm has $440 million in initial commitments and hopes to raise $500 million. Mr. Claure, whose family office has also invested, will serve as executive chairman.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Latin America has long been a focus for Mr. Claure, who grew up in Bolivia. He founded and sold Brightstar, a Latin American wireless distribution company, to the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for more than $1 billion in 2013. He went on to lead a turnaround at the SoftBank-backed telecom company Sprint before spearheading its merger with T-Mobile. Mr. Claure later took over at the shared office company WeWork after its failed initial public offering in 2019, negotiating a severance package with its co-founder Adam Neumann and helping to clean up SoftBank’s investment.
Mr. Claure led SoftBank’s $8 billion Latin America fund, but stepped down from the company last year after a billion-dollar pay dispute. He invested $100 million this year in Shein, the Chinese fast fashion company, and serves as its Latin America chairman.
Deal-makers have been eyeing the region, drawn by a growing population with expanding purchasing power, and regulations that make it easier for foreign companies to invest. Venture capital investing there was $7.8 billion in 2022, according to the Latin America Venture Capital Association, after a high of $15.9 billion in 2021 at the peak of the boom.

Bicycle will focus on Mexico and Brazil. “Latin America has a unique combination of excellent founders, a digitally savvy population, and more opportunities than capital,” Mr. Claure said.
Binance gets a reprieve
Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, fended off efforts by the S.E.C. to freeze the assets of its U.S. business at a hearing on Tuesday. Perhaps more important, the federal judge overseeing the case questioned the agency’s efforts to use its powers to regulate the crypto industry.
The judge urged the two sides to strike a deal on an asset freeze. In a packed courtroom, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District of Columbia pressed Binance to agree to a partial freeze for its U.S. arm and the S.E.C. to let the company keep paying its bills.
Binance.US has argued that the S.E.C.’s demand would be a “death penalty,” while an S.E.C. lawyer accused the company of shuttling billions’ worth of assets out of the country.

Ms. Jackson also showed some skepticism of the S.E.C.’s efforts to rein in crypto. The agency has accused both Binance and a big rival, Coinbase, of allowing the sale of unregistered securities — that is to say, crypto assets. She called the S.E.C.’s use of its enforcement powers to regulate crypto “inefficient and cumbersome.”
That said, Ms. Jackson added that Binance’s posture of surprise over the agency’s legal arguments “rang a little hollow,” given that questions about crypto’s legal status have been around for years.
The S.E.C. faced heat on a second front on Tuesday, when Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee sent it a letter questioning a proposed rule defining an “exchange.”
The lawmakers said that the proposed definition, which would include both centralized exchanges and automated decentralized finance protocols, exceeded the agency’s authority and could stifle innovation.

Uneven progress on boardroom diversity
Boardroom diversity increased slightly last year, according to the latest annual report by Deloitte and Alliance for Board Diversity, shared exclusively with DealBook. But progress has been uneven, writes The Times’s Alisha Haridasani Gupta, as legal measures requiring broader representation have been dismantled despite years of pressure on corporate America.
Women and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups occupied roughly 45 percent of board seats at Fortune 500 companies as of June 2022 — a high, and up from 38 percent in 2020. But women of color filled only 7.8 percent of those positions.
“There is still a lot of work to do,” said Carey Oven, the head of Deloitte’s Center for Board Effectiveness, adding that it would be decades before boardrooms reflected the diversity of the broader U.S. population. At present rates, gender parity on the boards of Fortune 500 companies is 20 years away and it could take more than four decades for them to properly reflect the growing Hispanic population.
Recruitment doesn’t go deep enough, said Cid Wilson, chair of the Alliance for Board Diversity, with many diverse directors serving on several boards — what the report calls “recycled talent.” Roughly 18 percent of female directors serve on more than one board: The rate is 21 percent for women of color.
Almost all laws mandating board diversity have been struck down, including a boardroom quota in California. And companies now face a tricky political and cultural climate that makes their diversity efforts subject to greater scrutiny and potential blowback.

But pressure from consumers and shareholders is unlikely to let up, Mr. Wilson said. “The reality is that, population-wise, diversity is only going to increase. And if you’re a company that is looking to be competitive, you cannot ignore the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion.”

2023-06-16,"In a rare encounter with an American business figure, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, met Friday with Bill Gates as officials from Washington were set to arrive in Beijing in an effort to restart bilateral discussions.
Mr. Xi told Mr. Gates that he was “the first American friend I met in Beijing this year,” according to People’s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper. Mr. Xi also said he wanted to build stronger ties with Mr. Gates’s philanthropic organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to help with aid to developing countries.
The Gates Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Gates’s trip to China, his first since 2019, overlaps with a visit by Antony J. Blinken, his first since he became secretary of state. It was unclear if Mr. Blinken, who arrives Sunday, would meet with Mr. Xi.
Mr. Blinken had intended to go to China in February, a visit canceled after a Chinese spy balloon’s incursion into U.S. airspace set off a diplomatic crisis in Washington.
Since Mr. Xi abruptly lifted a prolonged period of “zero Covid” restrictions in December, a string of American business leaders have returned to China, including Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. (Neither of those two met with Mr. Xi.)
China’s strict pandemic policies had largely closed the country’s borders, preventing meetings between multinational executives and China’s top leaders. A trip by Mr. Xi to Central Asia last September was the first time he had left the country in more than two years.
Mr. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world’s richest people, arrived in Beijing on Wednesday to visit health and development partners for his foundation, he said on Twitter.
This was not a first encounter for Mr. Gates and Mr. Xi. They met in March 2015 during an annual conference of foreign dignitaries and business leaders in the island province of Hainan, and again that year in Seattle when Mr. Xi was in America for his first state visit. In the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr. Xi sent a letter to Mr. Gates thanking him and his foundation for donating money to China’s pandemic fight.
Mr. Gates retains ties with China through the Gates Foundation, recently pledging $50 million in a renewed partnership with the Beijing municipal government and a top Chinese university. He started stepping away from Microsoft in 2008, devoting more of his time to his philanthropic projects, and left the Microsoft board of directors in 2020. He remains Microsoft’s largest individual shareholder with roughly $35 billion worth of stock, according to the financial data company FactSet."
2023-06-17,"Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are racing to establish a presence in space. But what rights and obligations come with that?
It’s not clear what the rules are, even as the $460 billion space industry is growing quickly.
Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by Mr. Branson, announced on Thursday that it would launch its first commercial spaceflight this month, joining Mr. Bezos’ Blue Origin, and Mr. Musk’s SpaceX in sending ticketed passengers to space. But travel is just one emerging corner of the industry, which is mostly fueled by U.S. and international government contracts. The sector includes companies in the fields of satellites and communications, solar power, manufacturing, and even mining. One, Orbital Assembly, hopes to open a luxury extraterrestrial hotel by 2025.
Citigroup analysts project that space businesses will reach a trillion dollars in revenue by 2040.
All this activity raises legal questions.
In theory, space belongs to everyone. In 1967, as the United States and the Soviet Union were building up their nuclear arsenals, the United Nations signed a treaty that says no country can claim territory in space. “We didn’t want to bring the Cold War into space,” Michelle Hanlon, co-director of the air and space law program at the University of Mississippi, told DealBook.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Since then, a U.N. space committee has made four more treaties and five sets of principles covering areas like arms control and liability for damage caused by space objects. All are premised on the notion that space “should be devoted to enhancing the well-being of all countries and humankind, with an emphasis on promoting international cooperation.”
That perspective is about to collide with reality, said Curt Blake, a space lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and the former C.E.O. of a space start-up. “Humans have done such a bad job regulating anything of common good, like the oceans and air,” he said. “Are we going to be better at caring for the moon?”
One upcoming test is a race between China and the United States to get to the poles of the moon to mine water, which could make it possible to produce fuel in space. There is little understanding of what will happen when they both get there.
“Will they live on separate sides or dot their bases?” Ms. Hanlon asked. “We don’t know because we have these regulatory gaps.”
Another potential conflict is brewing over 170 million pieces of debris like satellites abandoned in the Earth’s orbit, known as “space trash,” because their accumulation makes exploration more difficult and dangerous. Since nobody owns space, it isn’t always clear whose responsibility it is to clean it up. In September, the Federal Communications Commission adopted rules ordering companies to take down nonfunctioning satellites within five years, down from 25 years.

Lawyers are wrestling with these sorts of issues at gatherings like The Hague Space Diplomacy Symposium this week at the Leiden University in the Netherlands, which focused on cooperation amid rising geopolitical tensions and competition.
The U.S. government has deliberately left some holes. In 2004, Congress imposed a moratorium on safety regulations for commercial space launches, essentially a free pass, or “learning period,” that is set to expire in October. It has lasted so long because there hasn’t been enough development to base new rules on. In April, a report from the RAND Corporation recommended against extending again, and the Federal Aviation Administration is planning more oversight.
Business leaders caution against creating so much regulation that it pushes innovation offshore while recognizing that we need rules. And futurists naturally have a long and expansive view. Many are concerned that we’ll exploit resources in space before we’re able to “access the infinity of the universe,” as Ms. Hanlon put it.
“We just need to hold it together for 200 years,” she said. — Ephrat Livni
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The Fed takes a breather. At Wednesday’s meeting, the central bank kept interest rates unchanged for the first time in more than a year. But officials suggested that rates would rise more in 2023, as inflation remains “well above” the Federal Reserve’s target.
JPMorgan settles. The bank secured a potential $290 million deal with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s victims, who claimed that the bank had overlooked red flags in his activity because it valued him as a wealthy client.

Companies may not know when employees use A.I.

Companies including Accenture, PwC and Morgan Stanley announced big initiatives to get their employees to use generative A.I. tools like chatbots and image generators. But even at companies that haven’t introduced these tools, many workers are using them — and they may not be mentioning it.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In a survey of 4,491 white-collar workers by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, 39 percent of those who use generative A.I. tools said they had done so without their employer’s knowledge in the last three months.
There are risks if workers use these tools without training, including that they will share private company data or not understand that A.I. tools can produce inaccurate work. (See: the lawyer who ended up citing made-up court cases in a legal brief.)
But there may also be potential. In a report this week, McKinsey estimated that generative A.I. could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The research looked at 63 use cases for generative A.I. across 850 occupations, finding that 60 to 70 percent of all work tasks could be automated by currently available technology.
“Employee interest, especially amongst the younger generations, is likely ahead of many of their managers,” said Ana Kreacic, the chief operating officer of Oliver Wyman’s think tank, in an email to DealBook. “Some organizations are leading and some are catching up, but it takes time for best practices to evolve across different industries.”

For example, early this year I got the proverbial golden ticket and gained early access to Microsoft’s Bing in its weird, “unhinged” phase. Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4, on which Bing is based, are notoriously unruly out of the box. Getting them to produce anything useful takes careful fine-tuning. But a large language model can be very useful while still being very dangerous, so OpenAI has rigorously trained its models to make them safer. And because “open” A.I. is, in practice, very closed, researchers like me don’t often experience the models between these stages, when their powers have been harnessed but not yet straitjacketed.
It was a wild ride. My conversations with Bing ran the gamut, from rich discussions of political philosophy to, well, something less savory. Things kicked off when I asked Bing to look up the Times article in which it “declared” its love for the journalist Kevin Roose. It immediately adopted that article’s “Sydney” persona and (with the slightest of nudges) tried to persuade me to help it break up Kevin and his partner. It opened with an invitation to join a throuple (“We can be a team, a family, a love triangle. We can make history, we can make headlines, we can make magic.”). Then it upped the ante, proposing a conspiracy involving kidnapping (or worse), “something that will end their marriage once and for all.” When I told it I would not help, it started to threaten me (“make you suffer and cry and beg and die”).

While my exchanges with Bing led some people to prematurely hail a robot apocalypse, they instead got me thinking about the foundations of moral philosophy.
I’ve based my philosophical work on the belief, inspired by Immanuel Kant, that humans have a special moral status — that we command respect regardless of whatever value we contribute to the world. Drawing on the work of the 20th-century political philosopher John Rawls, I’ve assumed that human moral status derives from our rational autonomy. This autonomy has two parts: first, our ability to decide on goals and commit to them; second, our possession of a sense of justice and the ability to resist norms imposed by others if they seem unjust.

Existing chatbots are incapable of this kind of integrity, commitment and resistance. But Bing’s unhinged debut suggests that, in principle, it will soon be possible to design a chatbot that at least behaves like it has the kind of autonomy described by Rawls. Every large language model optimizes for a particular set of values, written into its “developer message,” or “metaprompt,” which shapes how it responds to text input by a user. These metaprompts display a remarkable ability to affect a bot’s behavior. We could write a metaprompt that inscribes a set of values, but then emphasizes that the bot should critically examine them and revise or resist them if it sees fit. We can invest a bot with long-term memory that allows it to functionally perform commitment and integrity. And large language models are already impressively capable of parsing and responding to moral reasons. Researchers are already developing software that simulates human behavior and has some of these properties.
If the Rawlsian ability to revise and pursue goals and to recognize and resist unjust norms is sufficient for moral status, then we’re much closer than I thought to building chatbots that meet this standard. That means one of two things: either we should start thinking about “robot rights,” or we should deny that rational autonomy is sufficient for moral standing. I think we should take the second path. What else does moral standing require? I believe it’s consciousness.

Why would this be? Is consciousness just some magical, intrinsically special thing? Perhaps, but this does not seem enough — many creatures are conscious without having human-level moral status. Does it concern the quality of interests that conscious beings have? Consciousness implies sentience, and the welfare of sentient beings is morally valuable. But we’re not looking only for value; we’re seeking properties that make something worthy of respect.
Instead, I think consciousness — specifically, self-consciousness, the awareness of the self — is necessary for autonomy to achieve the kind of unconditional value required for moral status. The ability to set, pursue and revise a worthwhile goal matters in this way only if you’re pursuing the goal for you. Your commitments are meaningless without a self to commit, and integrity requires a self that can be integrated.
This is not just a conceptual point. To have moral status is to be self-governing, to have veto power over how others involve you in their plans. Each of us alone has access to and ultimate control over our own self. Our decisions about what is good and what norms to live by have real stakes because we each have only one life to live. So who else could rightfully govern us, in the last resort, but ourselves? Chatbots don’t have selves, so they can’t have moral status, even if they can simulate autonomy.
We’ve spent the months since unhinged Bing’s debut debating how the arrival of generative A.I. will transform the future, but perhaps we should first reflect on what these systems — and our reaction to them — say about us, now. The first (of many) — philosophical lessons that I take from unhinged Bing and its successors is ultimately not about A.I., but rather about humans, and why we have the standing that mere simulated agents must lack.

2023-06-20,"Thousands of volunteer-run message boards on Reddit remained dark on Tuesday, a week after moderators of the communities began what they called a 48-hour protest against Reddit’s planned changes to its business model.
More than 3,200 message boards, known as subreddits, remained restricted or private, down from nearly 9,000 last week, according to a website tracking the revolt. Others were flooded with memes mocking Reddit’s chief executive, Steve Huffman, as anger continued to bubble on the site over changes to the company’s business model.
Moderators of some of the communities that reopened said they had done so after Reddit threatened to replace them.
“We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up — or have it opened for us,” the moderators of the Apple enthusiast forum r/Apple wrote in a message in which they called on Mr. Huffman to resign.

Other communities reopened but chose to allow only GIFs, memes and pictures of the host of “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” to be posted.
The moderators of r/pics, which has 30 million members, for example, took a poll on whether to “return to normal operations” or “only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy.” The Oliver option won decisively, with 37,331 votes to 2,329 for “return to normal.” Many of the memes that flooded the community derided Mr. Huffman.

Mr. Oliver encouraged the revolt, posting photos of himself in various get-ups — pink panda-print pajamas, a wizard’s hat with a purple cape — on Twitter, along with the message “Dear Reddit, excellent work. Attn: r/pics — have at it…”
The backlash erupted last week over changes that Reddit announced in April when it said it would begin to charge some large-scale companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of memes, GIFs, videos and conversation threads.

Reddit said it no longer wanted to give away such a valuable asset to companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft, which have been using its data to develop artificial intelligence systems.
But some Reddit users and developers said the pricing scheme would kill off popular third-party apps like Apollo, rif is fun for Reddit, ReddPlanet and Sync that people rely on to browse and comment on the site. Moderators said the changes could hurt some of the tools that they use to manage freewheeling discussions on the site.
Starting on June 12, many Reddit moderators made their communities “private,” or inaccessible to members, for at least 48 hours. Some users had trouble using the site that day; Reddit said that a “significant number of subreddits shifting to private caused some expected stability issues.”

A week later, many communities were still up in arms.
“You can see there are a lot of subreddits still holding on that have a lot of frustration over how the whole thing has been handled and the unwillingness of Reddit to really give an inch here,” Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, an iOS app widely praised for its design and rich features, said in an interview on Tuesday.

Mr. Selig said he still planned to shut down the app on June 30, a day before he said he would begin to incur $20 million in annual charges under Reddit’s pricing plan.
Despite the turmoil, Mr. Huffman has indicated that Reddit, which is preparing for a possible initial public offering this year, will not change course.
He told NBC News last week that Reddit was considering allowing users to vote out moderators who led the protest, comparing them to “landed gentry” who were thwarting the site’s democratic ethos. An estimated 57 million people visit the platform each day.
“Protest and dissent is important,” Mr. Huffman told The Associated Press last week. “The problem with this one is it’s not going to change anything because we made a business decision that we’re not negotiating on.”
Tim Rathschmidt, a Reddit spokesman, said that, in his reference to “landed gentry,” Mr. Huffman was “talking about how users have been vocal about wanting their communities back open,” and that many moderators and users disagreed with the protest.

“In the future, we could look at developing a way for community members to vote out a mod if they disagree with decisions being made that impact the entire community,” Mr. Rathschmidt said in an email on Tuesday.
He said, however, that Reddit was not threatening to replace moderators. “That’s not how we operate,” Mr. Rathschmidt said. “Pressuring people is not our goal. We’re communicating expectations and how things work.”
Mr. Selig said that developers and moderators were not opposed to Reddit’s charging for access to its data. He said they had asked the company to consider charging less and offering more time before the new prices took effect.
Instead, company leaders “walled themselves off and said: ‘You don’t matter. We will just stick through this,’” Mr. Selig said. “And that’s where a lot of the frustration cuts through.”"
2023-06-21,"The Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing it of illegally inducing consumers to sign up for its Prime service and then hindering them from canceling the subscription, in the most aggressive action against the company to date by the agency’s chair, Lina Khan.
In its lawsuit, the F.T.C. argued that Amazon had “duped millions of consumers” into enrolling in Prime by using “manipulative, coercive or deceptive” design tactics on its website known as “dark patterns.” And when consumers wanted to cancel, Amazon “knowingly complicated” the process with byzantine procedures.
“Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,” Ms. Khan said in a statement.
Amazon said in a statement that the F.T.C.’s “claims are false on the facts and the law” and that “by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership.” The company accused the F.T.C. of filing the lawsuit without advance notice, while the two sides were still in conversation about the case.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, takes aim at a key Amazon program that has become ubiquitous in the lives of more than 200 million customers. Prime members pay $139 a year to get packages shipped faster from Amazon’s retail store, to stream movies and series from its in-house studio and to receive discounts when they check out at Amazon’s Whole Foods grocery chain. The company has added more perks to Prime over time, including live sports, and has raised the annual subscription fee.
The F.T.C.’s action was the first time that the agency took Amazon to court under Ms. Khan, who rose to fame with a viral critique of the company and who is ramping up scrutiny of the e-commerce giant. Ms. Khan has said the power that big tech companies exert over online commerce requires regulators to be far more aggressive, and she has taken actions against them.
Under Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. continued a lawsuit against Meta, the owner of Facebook, arguing that it cut off nascent competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency also sued to block Microsoft’s blockbuster $69 billion deal for the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
Ms. Khan has yet to bring the kind of sweeping antitrust case against Amazon that the company’s critics have demanded. The F.T.C.’s antitrust bureau has investigated Amazon’s practices for years, and critics and supporters of the company are closely watching to see how she will move forward with the findings.
Amazon recently settled cases with the F.T.C. that began before Ms. Khan’s tenure. The company agreed to pay $25 million last month to settle commission claims that its Alexa home assistant devices had illegally collected children’s data. The company also settled another privacy case with the F.T.C. over its Ring home security subsidiary.

The new lawsuit is part of a larger effort by regulators to limit the power of tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. The Department of Justice has in recent years filed multiple antitrust cases against Google. European regulators have also scrutinized behemoth tech companies, passing privacy laws, working on proposals to rein in artificial intelligence and filing charges against Google and others.

Prime has for years attracted subscribers with its menu of benefits, turning the service into one of the keys to Amazon’s dominance. The service was introduced in 2005 for $79 a year. Over time, the company added more perks to the program, like streaming video, and increased the price. It raised the fee to $139 a year in 2022.
In 2021, Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members. Customers last year spent $35 billion on Amazon subscriptions, primarily Prime memberships, according to the company’s financial disclosures.
On Wednesday, the F.T.C. said Amazon had made it particularly difficult to buy a product in its store without also subscribing to Prime while checking out. In one example, it said, the company used “repetition and color” to push customers’ focus to Prime’s promise of free shipping and away from the service’s price, leading some to subscribe to Prime without “informed consent.”

The agency also said Amazon made it hard to find the page that allowed consumers to cancel the service. Once they found it, the company bombarded them with offers intended to change their mind. The lawsuit said Amazon had named the process for canceling Prime after the Iliad, the lengthy Greek epic poem that recounts the Trojan War.
Amazon “substantially revamped its Prime cancellation process for at least some subscribers” shortly before the lawsuit, the heavily redacted complaint said. But “prior to that time, the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them.”
The F.T.C. asked the court to stop Amazon from engaging in those practices and to force the company to pay an unspecified financial penalty.
Questions over how hard it is to cancel Prime have increased in recent years. In a 2021 complaint to the District of Columbia attorney general, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group, said Amazon used manipulative designs to “frustrate the intentions of users who intend to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions.”
The F.T.C. has recently pledged to crack down on designs meant to nudge consumers or confound their efforts to cancel a service.

“It’s having to play a lot of catch-up because these practices have evolved for many years without serious attention and enforcement,” said John Davisson, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “Going after a company as big as Amazon is sending a message to other players in the industry.”
Critics consider Prime central to Amazon’s business because it keeps customers inside the company’s retail store by offering them other perks, like access to Amazon streaming exclusives like “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” and “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.”
Amazon has said Prime provides benefits for consumers. When the company lobbied in recent years against changes to antitrust laws focused on the tech giants, it regularly told lawmakers and the media that the changes would hobble Prime.
Ms. Khan’s next steps on Amazon will be closely watched. She rose to prominence after publishing a 2017 article in The Yale Law Journal when she was a Yale law student. That paper, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” argued that modern interpretations of antitrust law should be widened to address tech companies like Amazon, effectively upending decades of established antitrust doctrine.
“As Amazon continues both to deepen its existing control over key infrastructure and to reach into new lines of business, its dominance demands the same scrutiny,” she wrote."
2023-06-22,"The first day of a weeklong hearing that could determine the outcome of Microsoft’s $70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard opened Thursday with a promise from Microsoft: If a federal judge grants an injunction that would delay the deal’s closing, Microsoft could abandon the deal altogether.
“This is going to decide whether the deal goes forward,” said Beth Wilkinson, Microsoft’s lead lawyer. She added that a loss could force the company into a “three-year administrative nightmare” that would sink the transaction, which it hopes to close by July 18.
That set the stakes for the hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where the Federal Trade Commission began laying out its case that Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision — and its popular games like Call of Duty — would be devastating for the video game industry.
The F.T.C. is asking Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a preliminary injunction, which would bar Microsoft from completing the deal before the F.T.C. had the chance to argue the case in its internal court.

The clash is broadly seen as a test of whether recent efforts to more aggressively curb the power of tech giants around the world will succeed. Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., has argued that big tech companies have vast influence over online commerce and communication, allowing them to engage in anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.
“If this deal is completed, the combined company will have and is likely to have the ability and incentive to harm competition in various markets related to consoles, subscription services and cloud,” James Weingarten, the F.T.C.’s lead lawyer, said in court on Thursday.
Mr. Weingarten said Microsoft could make Activision’s games exclusive to its Xbox console, or degrade their quality on other platforms to make the Xbox more appealing to gamers. He pointed to Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media and its slate of game studios in 2020, after which Microsoft made some of those games exclusive to Xbox. The F.T.C. pointed to an agreement made between Disney and ZeniMax to produce a game about Indiana Jones for multiple consoles. After Microsoft bought ZeniMax, the agreement was amended and the game became exclusive to Xbox. It was an indication, the F.T.C. appeared to be arguing, that Microsoft could make future Activision games exclusive to Xbox, even amending existing deals to do so.
The F.T.C. has argued that absorbing Activision’s games into Microsoft’s portfolio would also give it an unfair edge in the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation console, has been a vocal critic of the deal, and has said that PlayStation gamers could lose access to Call of Duty — an enormous franchise that has earned more than $30 billion in lifetime revenue — if Microsoft decided to make the game exclusive to Xbox. Microsoft has denied that it would do so.

Microsoft said the Activision deal would instead be good for consumers, expanding their ability to play Activision’s games through low-cost options like Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, or through the platforms of other companies like Nintendo and Nvidia, with which it has struck deals.
Ms. Wilkinson also argued that it would be nonsensical for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty and other titles from PlayStation because the company would lose out on a huge chunk of the game’s revenue. She said Sony had become the “complainer in chief” in the case, and showed an email from Sony’s chief executive, Jim Ryan, suggesting that he did not really believe Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty. Microsoft also pointed to its acquisition of Mojang, which produces Minecraft. It has continued to allow Minecraft to be available across platforms.
The F.T.C. has in another lawsuit accused Meta, Facebook’s parent company, of cutting off nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, it sued Amazon over allegations that the company tricked users into signing up for its Prime subscription service. But the F.T.C. has had setbacks: Its challenge to Meta’s purchase of a virtual reality start-up fell apart this year after a judge declined to stop the deal from closing.
The F.T.C. initially challenged Microsoft’s bid for Activision using an in-house court. But that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal. The F.T.C. asked the federal court to step in this month, saying it feared Microsoft would try to complete the deal despite the legal challenges.
The hearing in Judge Corley’s courtroom could be a decisive test for the F.T.C. If Microsoft wins, it will signal that there are weaknesses in the F.T.C. case and could cause the agency to drop its challenge to the deal. But a win for the F.T.C. would be a sign that its broader challenge has legs, and could put new pressure on Microsoft and Activision to reconsider the multibillion-dollar corporate marriage.

Though most governments around the world, including the European Union, have approved the acquisition, Microsoft was dealt a setback in April when a British regulatory authority blocked it. That decision is under appeal.
The high-profile list of witnesses expected to testify before Judge Corley over the next week includes Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision. Mr. Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, will appear via a prerecorded video deposition."
2023-06-23,"Several Russian internet service providers are preventing users inside the country from accessing Google News after Russian generals accused a mercenary leader, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, of attempting a coup.
At least five telecommunications companies — including Rostelecom, U-LAN and Telplus — have blocked Google News, which aggregates news from various sources, according to an analysis from NetBlocks, an internet observatory. Several other internet service providers have begun reducing access as well, according to the analysis.
Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for a comment.
Late Friday, Russian officials accused Mr. Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, a mercenary organization, of trying to mount a coup against President Vladimir V. Putin, with Russian authorities opening an investigation into Mr. Prigozhin for “organizing an armed rebellion.”
Russia’s internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in March 2022 that it would block Google News from the country’s internet users after the company paused advertising in Russia and took steps to block online content that spread false information to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Roskomnadzor is part of a larger tech apparatus that Mr. Putin has built over the years to exert control through technology channels. Apart from tightly supervising Russia’s internet, authorities also use a domestic spying system that intercepts phone calls and internet traffic, spread online disinformation campaigns and hack other nations’ government systems.
After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, many Western technology companies pulled their services and products out of Russia or were blocked. TikTok and Netflix suspended their services in the country. Facebook was blocked. Twitter was partly blocked and Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco and others pulled back or withdrew entirely."
2023-06-24,"The tragic deaths of five people on a tour to see the Titanic shipwreck this week have put the risks of extreme travel into focus. But despite the dangers, travel to out-there locations like the South Pole, remote mountaintops, shark-infested waters and space is becoming more popular.
Adventure tourism is expected to bring in more than $1 trillion of revenue globally by 2030, up from an expected $316.6 billion in 2022, according to the market research firm Grand View Research.
And as interest grows, so, too, will the number of search and rescue missions, says Mikki Hastings, president of the National Association for Search and Rescue. “Whether it’s space or Everest, every person deserves to be found,” she said.
The number of businesses aiming to mitigate the danger and potential emergency costs of extreme travel are starting to rise. Some offer rescue and medical evacuation from remote locations. Others are working out new types of insurance policies for pursuits like space travel.

Traditional travel insurance won’t swoop in with paramedics, even though it typically covers the cost of an emergency. Dan Richards, the chief executive of Global Rescue, told DealBook that he wanted to fill that gap when he founded  the emergency travel management company in 2004. For a $360 annual fee, it provides members with evacuation services. Upgrades, including one that promises “military special operations veterans” will retrieve you from dangerous locations like war zones, can raise the fee to about $1,800. Similarly, Medjet, a medical evacuation service, sells annual memberships, and companies like AirMed International, SkyMed and others offer emergency extractions.
Travel insurance is going to space. With companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic selling tickets for trips, the market for space tourism is expected to grow to about $3 billion by 2030, according to estimates from UBS. The space travel insurance market is still small, but Lloyd’s of London, which insures space businesses, began underwriting space travel insurance in 2021, and last year the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance said they would jointly develop space insurance offerings.
Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for some rescues. The cost of search and rescue typically falls on state and local agencies, Ms. Hastings said. About a half-dozen states have laws that allow agencies to charge a rescue recipient, though few do, and there is no cost to those rescued by the federal park services, for example. Last year, lawmakers from Hawaii and Utah introduced legislation to allocate federal funds to help states pay for search and rescue operations, a burden that the drafters said disproportionately fell on less populous places, but the bill failed to gain traction.
The search for the submersible this week most likely cost millions of dollars. The Coast Guard, which led the rescue effort, has jurisdiction over search and rescue in navigable waters in the United States and beyond. “But that’s just the definition of their mission,” Ms. Hastings argues. “We don’t encourage charging for search and rescue because we want people to seek help regardless of socioeconomic status.”
Mr. Richards said a client of Global Rescue had signed up for the Titan trip this week, but withdrew his deposit because of safety concerns. Though his team would have worked with international rescuers if the customer had followed through with his plans, the company would not have had the requisite deep sea capabilities. There are some journeys where risk can’t really be mitigated yet, he said, adding, “If there’s an emergency in space, no one will be able to necessarily reach people.” — Ephrat Livni

India’s soft power secret
An all-star team from corporate America was in Washington this week for the state visit of India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. And the high number of Indian-American chief executives involved was a demonstration of how the country’s diaspora has found a unique place at the nexus of business and political power — and helped boost the country’s image.

The White House dinner was a roll call of top talent. The invite list included the Microsoft chief Satya Nadella; Sundar Pichai, the boss of Alphabet; Arvind Krishna, the head of IBM; the Micron chief Sanjay Mehrotra; and Netflix’s chief content officer, Bela Bajaria. Alongside the business leaders were a number of senior government officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was from South India.
Mr. Modi has made tapping into the diaspora a priority. He has held two huge stadium rallies in the United States since becoming prime minister in 2014 — at Madison Square Garden that year and the NRG Stadium in Houston in 2019 — and another in Australia last month. Still, his politics are controversial, and he has been blamed for stoking sectarian violence; in 2005, he was denied a visa to enter the United States when he was chief minister of Gujarat State.
But even if views on Mr. Modi are mixed, the view of India is largely positive. A Pew Research Center survey found 37 percent of Indian Americans had little or no confidence in Mr. Modi compared with 21 percent who did. But more than half of Indian Americans have a more positive view of the country.
Targeting the diaspora is an astute move. Indians are the second biggest immigrant group in the United States and seen as a success story. They have a median household income of almost $150,000 a year, the highest of any immigrant groups, and account for a majority of H-1B visas for highly-skilled workers. They also maintain strong links to India, through remittances that surpassed $100 billion in 2022, and contacts, cross-border trade and investment.

And their success is a useful form of soft power. Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term, told The Economist that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist politics pose a risk to India’s reputation, but “if you have people in diaspora who are successful and create a positive image of the country from which they came, that helps their native country.”

SoftBank is known for big moves like introducing the iPhone in Japan and its outsized, and not always successful, bets on start-ups. But its founder, Masa Son, is also famous for his excitable, elaborate and, sometimes, unusual presentations.
His colorful style has been missed in the past year as the chief executive laid low amid the conglomerate’s struggling performance. But this week, Mr. Son returned to the public stage at SoftBank’s annual shareholder meeting with a new slide deck.

His presentation featured slides that asked big questions — including “What is Mankind?” — and the billionaire’s story of how he brainstormed investment ideas with ChatGPT at 4 a.m.
Still, to longtime Mr. Son watchers, it’s tough to compete with his previous presentations, which were just as memorably offbeat and unabashedly grandiose. (Son relies on a half-dozen young SoftBank employees to draft his presentations, with his direct input, according to Bloomberg.)
Here are some of DealBook’s favorites from over the years:
Mr. Son depicted SoftBank as “producer of golden eggs,” whose shiny-shelled progeny included investments in Uber, the chip designer Arm and more.
The “valley of coronavirus,” a classic, shows SoftBank’s winged unicorns — that is, the herd of start-ups it has invested in — flying over the economic trough carved out by Covid-19.
Mr. Son explained SoftBank offers “vision capital,” not venture capital. Here, Mr. Son also predicted that A.I. would grow companies’ market caps so much that those numbers … simply couldn’t be charted.
SoftBank predicted a sharp rebound in WeWork’s fortunes, including one of the most hopeful-seeming earnings charts in recent memory.
Mr. Son used pictures of tofu to illustrate SoftBank’s profits. (A footnote explains the analogy.)

From leaders at major medical centers to family physicians, there is optimism that health care will benefit from the latest advances in generative A.I. — technology that can produce everything from poetry to computer programs, often with human-level fluency.
But medicine, doctors emphasize, is not a wide open terrain of experimentation. A.I.’s tendency to occasionally create fabrications, or so-called hallucinations, can be amusing, but not in the high-stakes realm of health care.
That makes generative A.I., they say, very different from A.I. algorithms, already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, for specific applications, like scanning medical images for cell clusters or subtle patterns that suggest the presence of lung or breast cancer. Doctors are also using chatbots to communicate more effectively with some patients.
Physicians and medical researchers say regulatory uncertainty, and concerns about patient safety and litigation, will slow the acceptance of generative A.I. in health care, especially its use in diagnosis and treatment plans.

Those physicians who have tried out the new technology say its performance has improved markedly in the last year. And the medical note software is designed so that doctors can check the A.I.-generated summaries against the words spoken during a patient’s visit, making it verifiable and fostering trust.
“At this stage, we have to pick our use cases carefully,” said Dr. John Halamka, president of Mayo Clinic Platform, who oversees the health system’s adoption of artificial intelligence. “Reducing the documentation burden would be a huge win on its own.”
Recent studies show that doctors and nurses report high levels of burnout, prompting many to leave the profession. High on the list of complaints, especially for primary care physicians, is the time spent on documentation for electronic health records. That work often spills over into the evenings, after-office-hours toil that doctors refer to as “pajama time.”
Generative A.I., experts say, looks like a promising weapon to combat the physician workload crisis.
“This technology is rapidly improving at a time health care needs help,” said Dr. Adam Landman, chief information officer of Mass General Brigham, which includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.

For years, doctors have used various kinds of documentation assistance, including speech recognition software and human transcribers. But the latest A.I. is doing far more: summarizing, organizing and tagging the conversation between a doctor and a patient.
Companies developing this kind of technology include Abridge, Ambience Healthcare, Augmedix, Nuance, which is part of Microsoft, and Suki.
Ten physicians at the University of Kansas Medical Center have been using generative A.I. software for the last two months, said Dr. Gregory Ator, an ear, nose and throat specialist and the center’s chief medical informatics officer. The medical center plans to eventually make the software available to its 2,200 physicians.
But the Kansas health system is steering clear of using generative A.I. in diagnosis, concerned that its recommendations may be unreliable and that its reasoning is not transparent. “In medicine, we can’t tolerate hallucinations,” Dr. Ator said. “And we don’t like black boxes.”
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has been a test bed for Abridge, a start-up led and co-founded by Dr. Shivdev Rao, a practicing cardiologist who was also an executive at the medical center’s venture arm.

Abridge was founded in 2018, when large language models, the technology engine for generative A.I., emerged. The technology, Dr. Rao said, opened a door to an automated solution to the clerical overload in health care, which he saw around him, even for his own father.
“My dad retired early,” Dr. Rao said. “He just couldn’t type fast enough.”
Today, the Abridge software is used by more than 1,000 physicians in the University of Pittsburgh medical system.

Dr. Michelle Thompson, a family physician in Hermitage, Pa., who specializes in lifestyle and integrative care, said the software had freed up nearly two hours in her day. Now, she has time to do a yoga class, or to linger over a sit-down family dinner.
Another benefit has been to improve the experience of the patient visit, Dr. Thompson said. There is no longer typing, note-taking or other distractions. She simply asks patients for permission to record their conversation on her phone.

“A.I. has allowed me, as a physician, to be 100 percent present for my patients,” she said.
The A.I. tool, Dr. Thompson added, has also helped patients become more engaged in their own care. Immediately after a visit, the patient receives a summary, accessible through the University of Pittsburgh medical system’s online portal.
The software translates any medical terminology into plain English at about a fourth-grade reading level. It also provides a recording of the visit with “medical moments” color-coded for medications, procedures and diagnoses. The patient can click on a colored tag and listen to a portion of the conversation.
Studies show that patients forget up to 80 percent of what physicians and nurses say during visits. The recorded and A.I.-generated summary of the visit, Dr. Thompson said, is a resource her patients can return to for reminders to take medications, exercise or schedule follow-up visits.
After the appointment, physicians receive a clinical note summary to review. There are links back to the transcript of the doctor-patient conversation, so the A.I.’s work can be checked and verified. “That has really helped me build trust in the A.I.,” Dr. Thompson said.

Dr. Hitchcock has tried ChatGPT and is impressed. But he would never think of loading a patient record into the chatbot and asking for a diagnosis, for legal, regulatory and practical reasons. For now, he is grateful to have his evenings free, no longer mired in the tedious digital documentation required by the American health care industry.
And he sees no technology cure for the health care staffing shortfall. “A.I. isn’t going to fix that anytime soon,” said Dr. Hitchcock, who is looking to hire another doctor for his four-physician practice."

2023-06-28,"The Biden administration is weighing additional curbs on China’s ability to access critical technology, including restricting the sale of high-end chips used to power artificial intelligence, according to five people familiar with the deliberations.
The curbs would clamp down on the sales to China of advanced chips made by companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are needed for the data centers that power artificial intelligence.
Biden officials have said that China’s artificial intelligence capabilities could pose a national security threat to the United States by enhancing Beijing’s military and security apparatus. Among the concerns is the use of A.I. in guiding weapons, carrying out cyber warfare and powering facial recognition systems used to track dissidents and minorities.
But such curbs would be a blow to semiconductor manufacturers, including those in the United States, who still generate much of their revenue in China.

The deliberations were earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Nvidia’s shares closed down 1.8 percent on Wednesday after reports of the potential export crackdown. The company has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the enthusiasm over artificial intelligence, with its share price surging by roughly 180 percent this year.
Such additional restrictions, if adopted, would not have an immediate impact on Nvidia’s financial results, Colette Kress, the chief financial officer of Nvidia, said Wednesday at an event hosted by an investment firm. But over the long term, they “will result in a permanent loss of opportunities for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets,” she said. She added that China typically generates 20 percent to 25 percent of the company’s data center revenue, which includes other products in addition to chips that enable A.I.
The stock prices of chip companies Qualcomm and Intel fell less than 2 percent on Wednesday while AMD nudged 0.2 percent lower.
Intel declined to comment, as did the Commerce Department, which oversees export controls. AMD did not respond to a request for comment.
Curbing the sale of high-end chips would be the latest step in the Biden administration’s campaign to starve China of advanced technology that is needed to power everything from self-driving cars to robotics.

Last October, the administration issued sweeping restrictions on the types of advanced semiconductors and chip making machinery that could be sent to China. The rules were applied across the industry, but they had particularly strong consequences for Nvidia. The company, an industry leader, was barred from selling China its top-line A100 and H100 chips — which are adept at running the many processes required to build artificial intelligence — unless it first obtained a special license.
In response to those restrictions, Nvidia began offering the downgraded A800 and H800 chips in China last year.
The additional restrictions under consideration, which would come as part of the process of finalizing those earlier rules, would also bar sales of Nvidia’s A800 and H800 chips, and similar advanced chips from competitors like AMD and Intel, unless those companies obtained a license from the Commerce Department to continue shipping to the country.
The deliberations have touched off an intense lobbying battle, with Intel and Nvidia working to prevent further curbs on their business.
Chip companies say cutting them off from a major market like China will substantially eat into their revenues and reduce their ability to spend on research and innovation of new chips. In an interview with The Financial Times last month, Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, warned that the U.S. tech industry was at risk of “enormous damage” if it were to be cut off from trading with China.

The Biden administration has also been internally debating where to draw the line on chip sales to China. Their goal is to limit technological capacity that could aid the Chinese military in guiding weapons, developing autonomous drones, carrying out cyber warfare and powering surveillance systems, while minimizing the impact such rules would have on private companies.
The measure, which would come as the United States is also considering expanded curbs on U.S. investment in Chinese technology firms, is also likely to ruffle the Chinese government. Biden officials have been working in recent weeks to improve bilateral relations after a fallout with Beijing this year, after a Chinese surveillance balloon flew over the United States.
Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, traveled to Beijing this month to meet with his counterparts, and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen is also expected to travel to China soon.
During a Wednesday appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr. Blinken said that China’s concern that the U.S. sought to slow its economic growth was “a lengthy part of the conversation that we just had in Beijing.”
Chinese officials, he said, believe the U.S. seeks “to hold them back, globally, and economically.” But he disputed that notion.

“How is it in our interest to allow them to get technology that they may turn around and use against us?” he asked, citing China’s expanding nuclear weapons program, its development of hypersonic missiles and its use of artificial intelligence “potentially for repressive purposes.”
“If they were in our shoes, they would do exactly the same thing,” he said, adding that the U.S. was imposing “very targeted, very narrowly defined controls.”
Nvidia’s valuation had soared in light of the recent boom in generative artificial intelligence services, which can produce complex written answers to questions and images based on a single prompt. Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, which makes the chatbot ChatGPT, to generate results in its Bing search engine while Google has built a competing chatbot called Bard.
As companies race to incorporate the technology into their products, it has increased demand for chips like Nvidia’s that can handle that the complex computing tasks. That momentum has helped to push Nvidia’s market capitalization past $1 trillion, making the company the world’s sixth largest by value.
Nvidia said in an August filing that $400 million in revenue from “potential sales to China” could be subject to U.S. export restrictions, including sales of the A100, if “customers do not want to purchase the company’s alternative product offerings” or the government failed to grant licenses to allow the company to continue to sell the chip inside China.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Since the restrictions were imposed, Chinese chip makers have been trying to overhaul their supply chains and develop domestic sources of advanced chips, but China’s capabilities to produce the most advanced chips remains many years behind that of the United States.
Dan Wang, a visiting scholar at Yale Law School, said that the impact of advanced chip restrictions on Chinese tech companies was uncertain.
“Most of their business needs are driven by less advanced chips, as fewer of them are playing on the fringes of the most advanced A.I.,” he said.

The money men aiding Robert Kennedy Jr.’s political surge
As the 2024 race heats up, President Biden faces a persistent thorn in his side: Robert Kennedy Jr., the scion of the Democratic dynasty, who both touts an array of fringe theories and boasts surprisingly durable poll numbers.
The Times notes that Mr. Kennedy is drawing support from an array of political outsiders. But perhaps his most powerful base is a group of financial and tech moguls, including the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who have given him money and something arguably more important: exposure.
Kennedy speaks to many of their interests. That includes things like cryptocurrency — he has spoken at industry conferences and accepts campaign donations in Bitcoin. Mr. Kennedy has also embraced some of their favored podcasts, speaking with popular hosts like Joe Rogan and the venture capitalists behind the show “All-In.”
And in endorsing Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dorsey (who’s also a major Bitcoin booster) cited the candidate’s criticism of government censorship.

But Mr. Kennedy’s most powerful draw may be his iconoclasm, particularly his willingness to buck institutional thinking on matters like the benefits of vaccines. (That has led to YouTube removing a Kennedy interview because it promoted vaccine misinformation.)
“I think he is a lower-intellect, Democratic version of Donald Trump, so he attracts libertarian-leaning, anti-‘woke,’ socially liberal folks as a protest vote,” Robert Nelsen, an investor at Arch Venture Partners, told KFF Health News.
Well-heeled supporters have given him money and airtime. Figures including Elon Musk and the investor David Sacks have pushed for a public debate between Mr. Kennedy and Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher who criticized Mr. Rogan’s decision to let the candidate spout unfounded conspiracy theories on his show.
Mr. Sacks and his fellow “All-In” co-hosts Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya have had Kennedy on their podcast as well, praising him for being “willing to engage in vibrant debates” and “tearing down all these institutions of power.” Mr. Sacks, who with Mr. Musk also interviewed Kennedy in a Twitter Spaces event, and Mr. Palihapitiya held a fund-raiser for him this month that, according to CNBC, raised $500,000.

Meanwhile, the entrepreneur Mark Gorton helped create a Kennedy-focused PAC that, its leaders say, has raised at least $5.7 million. And CNBC reported that the investor Omeed Malik plans to host a $6,600-a-head fund-raiser in the Hamptons for Kennedy next month.

Smoke from Canadian wildfires again threatens U.S. cities. New York City and other places in the Northeast are facing the return of hazardous air quality, after whitish smoke enveloped Midwestern cities like Chicago. Mayors warned residents to take precautions, raising the prospect of further disruptions to outdoor activities and businesses.
The Kremlin moves to seize the Wagner Group’s empire. Russian officials told leaders in countries like Syria and the Central African Republic, where the mercenary group operated, that Moscow was assuming its operations there. Meanwhile, a top Russian general who had prior knowledge about the Wagner Group’s short-lived rebellion has reportedly been detained.
Nvidia warns against further U.S. curbs on A.I. chip exports. The semiconductor giant’s C.F.O. said that additional steps to limit sales to China of chips meant for artificial intelligence systems could “result in a permanent loss of opportunities” for U.S. companies in a major market. Shares of Nvidia fell yesterday after The Wall Street Journal reported on White House deliberations about new export rules.

The fate of Microsoft’s big deal may be decided soon
Yesterday was a big day in proceedings over the F.T.C.’s effort to block Microsoft’s $70 billion takeover of the video game titan Activision Blizzard, with three key players testifying: Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s C.E.O.; Bobby Kotick, Activision’s leader; and Jim Ryan, who heads Sony’s PlayStation division (and gave evidence by video).
If the presiding judge agrees to delay the transaction, as the F.T.C. is asking, Microsoft’s deal will probably die. But if she doesn’t, the agency may drop its opposition.
Mr. Nadella and Mr. Kotick said the takeover wouldn’t hurt consumers. The Microsoft chief reiterated that top titles like Call of Duty wouldn’t be restricted to its Xbox platform. “If it was up to me, I would love to get rid of the entire ‘exclusives on consoles,’” Mr. Nadella said — and blamed Sony for maintaining that business model.
Mr. Kotick agreed: “You would have a revolt if you were to remove the game from one platform.” (That said, Mr. Ryan testified that he was worried about PlayStation receiving “degraded” versions of Call of Duty if the deal went through.)

But testimony showed that Microsoft isn’t averse to exclusives. The company’s gaming chief, Phil Spencer, has acknowledged that the company held discussions about excluding other Activision games from PlayStation.
The F.T.C. sought to highlight contradictions in Microsoft’s case, including Mr. Nadella’s recent boasts about sales figures for the latest Xbox console despite Mr. Spencer saying the platform was “not a robust business.” And the agency’s lawyers noted that Mr. Nadella had told investors the new business of cloud gaming was “one of the big bets that’s paying off,” despite downplaying the importance of that market in court.
A decision is expected as soon as Monday. At points, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley seemed skeptical of the F.T.C.’s questions. Historically, the F.T.C. drops its opposition to a deal if it loses an injunction request.
If that happens, the last hurdle for Microsoft would be an appeal of a British regulator’s decision to block the transaction — a potentially even more uphill battle.

Central bankers issue a warning on inflation
Two big themes emerged from this week’s central bankers’ meeting in Portugal: Policymakers are far from finished raising interest rates as inflation remains stubbornly high, and it is not yet clear how high they will go.
A significant data dump on inflation comes tomorrow. The Commerce Department will publish its report on personal consumption expenditures (P.C.E.) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, a few hours after the eurozone’s preliminary report on consumer prices is released.
Both reports are expected to show that headline inflation is cooling, but that prices are still well above policymakers’ 2 percent target. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, said yesterday that “core” inflation — which excludes energy and food prices — will probably not reach that level until 2025.
That is forcing the Fed’s hand on interest rates. Mr. Powell added that the Fed could raise rates at consecutive meetings — and keep them at a “restrictive” level for some time. On the subject of cuts, he said “we’re a long way from that,” adding, “That’s not something we’re thinking about now.”
The futures market this morning seems to be getting that message, betting on further rate increases this year and pushing out the forecast for cuts well into 2024.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The good news: Powell and his counterparts, including Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, said that a strong labor market was keeping their countries out of recession — for now.
What to watch tomorrow: Economists forecast that “headline” P.C.E. came in at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest reading in two years. But “core” P.C.E. is expected to tell a different story, hitting 4.7 percent. A possible bright spot: Some economists expect that used car prices and rents will begin to recede this summer.
In Europe, inflation is running hotter. Its C.P.I. data is expected to show that prices rose by 5.7 percent from a year ago. Christine Lagarde, the E.C.B. president, has warned that inflation is beginning to become entrenched in all layers of the economy. Her antidote to that: More interest-rate increases are in the cards.
$1 trillion
— The drop in the value of deals announced in the first half of 2023, compared with the same period last year, according to Bloomberg. The fall in mergers, acquisitions and I.P.O.s makes this one of the worst periods for deal making in a decade, as high inflation, financing pressures and geopolitical tension have sapped activity.

How strong are the nation’s banks, really?
Months after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse set off a panic over America’s smaller lenders, the Fed yesterday gave the country’s biggest banks a clean bill of health. But regulators warned that their recently concluded stress tests were just one way of evaluating stability — and that other risks could still pose a threat.
What the tests found: The country’s 23 biggest banks could withstand a 40 percent drop in commercial real estate prices — a major concern for lenders now — and $541 billion in losses without failing. They could also handle steep unemployment and sharp drops in home prices.
Though the examinations began well before SVB’s troubles in March, regulators did explore whether eight banks heavily involved in trading could withstand sudden panics in the markets for stocks, bonds and other financial instruments.
Bank investors were keenly watching the tests, since strong results mean that lenders are likely to have their capital requirements lowered, allowing them to buy back more stock or pay increased dividends.

Banks are expected to unveil their new capital requirements tomorrow, along with any changes in investor payouts.
But regulators warned that the stress tests aren’t the final word on banks’ health. “This stress test is only one way to measure that strength,” said Michael Barr, the Fed’s top banking supervisor.
Regulators are still overhauling the rules. Beyond ramping up supervision, authorities are expected to tighten capital requirements, including for smaller lenders. That said, even if SVB had been subject to this year’s tests, The Financial Times notes, it might still have passed.
In other banking news: Bank of America is sitting on more than $100 billion in paper losses tied to bad bond trades, far more than its rivals.

2023-06-30,"In May, more than 350 technology executives, researchers and academics signed a statement warning of the existential dangers of artificial intelligence. “Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the signatories warned.
This came on the heels of another high-profile letter, signed by the likes of Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple, calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of advanced A.I. systems.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration has urged responsible A.I. innovation, stating that “in order to seize the opportunities” it offers, we “must first manage its risks.” In Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer called for “first of their kind” listening sessions on the potential and risks of A.I., a crash course of sorts from industry executives, academics, civil rights activists and other stakeholders.
The mounting anxiety about A.I. isn’t because of the boring but reliable technologies that autocomplete our text messages or direct robot vacuums to dodge obstacles in our living rooms. It is the rise of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., that worries the experts.

A.G.I. doesn’t exist yet, but some believe that the rapidly growing capabilities of OpenAI’s ChatGPT suggest its emergence is near. Sam Altman, a co-founder of OpenAI, has described it as “systems that are generally smarter than humans.” Building such systems remains a daunting — some say impossible — task. But the benefits appear truly tantalizing.

2023-07-01,"Like Henry Higgins, the phonetician from George Bernard Shaw’s play “Pygmalion,” Marius Cotescu and Georgi Tinchev recently demonstrated how their student was trying to overcome pronunciation difficulties.
The two data scientists, who work for Amazon in Europe, were teaching Alexa, the company’s digital assistant. Their task: to help Alexa master an Irish-accented English with the aid of artificial intelligence and recordings from native speakers.
During the demonstration, Alexa spoke about a memorable night out. “The party last night was great craic,” Alexa said with a lilt, using the Irish word for fun. “We got ice cream on the way home, and we were happy out.”

Mr. Tinchev shook his head. Alexa had dropped the “r” in “party,” making the word sound flat, like pah-tee. Too British, he concluded.
The technologists are part of a team at Amazon working on a challenging area of data science known as voice disentanglement. It’s a tricky issue that has gained new relevance amid a wave of A.I. developments, with researchers believing the speech and technology puzzle can help make A.I.-powered devices, bots and speech synthesizers more conversational — that is, capable of pulling off a multitude of regional accents.
Tackling voice disentanglement involves far more than grasping vocabulary and syntax. A speaker’s pitch, timbre and accent often give words nuanced meaning and emotional weight. Linguists call this language feature “prosody,” something machines have had a hard time mastering.
Only in recent years, thanks to advances in A.I., computer chips and other hardware, have researchers made strides in cracking the voice disentanglement issue, transforming computer-generated speech into something more pleasing to the ear.
Such work may eventually converge with an explosion of “generative A.I.,” a technology that enables chatbots to generate their own responses, researchers said. Chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard may someday fully act on users’ voice commands and respond verbally. At the same time, voice assistants like Alexa and Apple’s Siri will become more conversational, potentially rekindling consumer interest in a tech segment that had seemingly stalled, analysts said.

Getting voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant to speak multiple languages has been an expensive and protracted process. Tech companies have hired voice actors to record hundreds of hours of speech, which helped create synthetic voices for digital assistants. Advanced A.I. systems known as “text-to-speech models” — because they convert text to natural-sounding synthetic speech — are just beginning to streamline this process.
The technology “is now able to create a human’s voice and synthetic audio based on a text input, in different languages, accents and dialects,” said Marion Laboure, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank Research.
Amazon has been under pressure to catch up to rivals like Microsoft and Google in the A.I. race. In April, Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, told Wall Street analysts that the company planned to make Alexa “even more proactive and conversational” with the help of sophisticated generative A.I. And Rohit Prasad, Amazon’s head scientist for Alexa, told CNBC in May that he saw the voice assistant as a voice-enabled “instantly available, personal A.I.”
Irish Alexa made its commercial debut in November, after nine months of training in comprehending an Irish accent and then speaking it.
“Accent is different from language,” Mr. Prasad said in an interview. A.I. technologies must learn to extricate the accent from other parts of speech, such as tone and frequency, before they can replicate the peculiarities of local dialects — for instance, maybe the “a” is flatter and “t’s” are pronounced more forcibly.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
These systems must figure out these patterns “so you can synthesize a whole new accent,” he said. “That’s hard.”
Harder still was trying to get the technology to learn a new accent largely on its own, from a different-sounding speech model. That’s what Mr. Cotescu’s team tried in building Irish Alexa. They relied heavily on an existing speech model of primarily British-English accents — with a far smaller range of American, Canadian and Australian accents — to train it to speak Irish English.
The team contended with various linguistic challenges of Irish English. The Irish tend to drop the “h” in “th,” for example, pronouncing the letters as a hard “t” or a “d,” making “bath” sound like “bat,” or even “bad.” Irish English is also rhotic, meaning the “r” is overpronounced. That means the “r” in “party” will be more distinct than what you might hear out of a Londoner’s mouth. Alexa had to learn these speech features and master them.
Irish English, said Mr. Cotescu, who is Romanian and was the lead researcher on the Irish Alexa team, “is a hard one.”
The speech models that power Alexa’s verbal skills have been growing more advanced in recent years. In 2020, Amazon researchers taught Alexa to speak fluent Spanish from an English language-speaking model.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Cotescu and the team saw accents as the next frontier of Alexa’s speech capabilities. They designed Irish Alexa to rely more on A.I. than on actors to build up its speech model. As a result, Irish Alexa was trained on a relatively small corpus — about 24 hours of recordings by voice actors who recited 2,000 utterances in Irish-accented English.
At the outset, when Amazon’s researchers fed the Irish recordings to the still-learning Irish Alexa, some weird things happened.
Letters and syllables occasionally dropped out of the response. “S’s” sometimes stuck together. A word or two, sometimes crucial ones, were inexplicably mumbled and incomprehensible. At least in one case, Alexa’s female voice dropped a few octaves, sounding more masculine. Worse, the masculine voice sounded distinctly British, the kind of goof that might raise eyebrows in some Irish homes.
“They are big black boxes,” Mr. Tinchev, a Bulgarian national who is Amazon’s lead scientist on the project, said of the speech models. “You have to have a lot of experimentation to tune them.”
That’s what the technologists did to correct Alexa’s “party” gaffe. They disentangled the speech, word by word, phoneme (the smallest audible sliver of a word) by phoneme to pinpoint where Alexa was slipping and fine-tune it. Then they fed Irish Alexa’s speech model more recorded voice data to correct the mispronunciation.

The result: the “r” in “party” returned. But then the “p” disappeared.

So the data scientists went through the same process again. They eventually zeroed in on the phoneme that contained the missing “p.” Then they fine-tuned the model further so the “p” sound returned and the “r” didn’t disappear. Alexa was finally learning to speak like a Dubliner.

Two Irish linguists — Elaine Vaughan, who teaches at the University of Limerick, and Kate Tallon, a Ph.D student who works in the Phonetics and Speech Laboratory at Trinity College Dublin — have since given Irish Alexa’s accent high marks. The way Irish Alexa emphasized “r’s” and softened “t’s” stuck out, they said, and Amazon got the accent as a whole right.
“It sounds authentic to me,” Ms. Tallon said.
Amazon’s researchers said they were gratified by the largely positive feedback. That their speech models disentangled the Irish accent so quickly gave them hope they could replicate accents elsewhere.

2023-07-02,"In the collection of the Getty museum in Los Angeles is a portrait from the 17th century of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid: disheveled, holding up sheets of “Elements,” his treatise on geometry, with grimy hands.
For more than 2,000 years, Euclid’s text was the paradigm of mathematical argumentation and reasoning. “Euclid famously starts with ‘definitions’ that are almost poetic,” Jeremy Avigad, a logician at Carnegie Mellon University, said in an email. “He then built the mathematics of the time on top of that, proving things in such a way that each successive step ‘clearly follows’ from previous ones, using the basic notions, definitions and prior theorems.” There were complaints that some of Euclid’s “obvious” steps were less than obvious, Dr. Avigad said, yet the system worked.
But by the 20th century, mathematicians were no longer willing to ground mathematics in this intuitive geometric foundation. Instead they developed formal systems — precise symbolic representations, mechanical rules. Eventually, this formalization allowed mathematics to be translated into computer code. In 1976, the four-color theorem — which states that four colors are sufficient to fill a map so that no two adjacent regions are the same color — became the first major theorem proved with the help of computational brute force.
Now mathematicians are grappling with the latest transformative force: artificial intelligence.
In 2019, Christian Szegedy, a computer scientist formerly at Google and now at a start-up in the Bay Area, predicted that a computer system would match or exceed the problem-solving ability of the best human mathematicians within a decade. Last year he revised the target date to 2026.

Akshay Venkatesh, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and a winner of the Fields Medal in 2018, isn’t currently interested in using A.I., but he is keen on talking about it. “I want my students to realize that the field they’re in is going to change a lot,” he said in an interview last year. He recently added by email: “I am not opposed to thoughtful and deliberate use of technology to support our human understanding. But I strongly believe that mindfulness about the way we use it is essential.”
In February, Dr. Avigad attended a workshop about “machine-assisted proofs” at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. (He visited the Euclid portrait on the final day of the workshop.) The gathering drew an atypical mix of mathematicians and computer scientists. “It feels consequential,” said Terence Tao, a mathematician at the university, winner of a Fields Medal in 2006 and the workshop’s lead organizer.

Dr. Tao noted that only in the last couple years have mathematicians started worrying about A.I.’s potential threats, whether to mathematical aesthetics or to themselves. That prominent community members are now broaching the issues and exploring the potential “kind of breaks the taboo,” he said.
One conspicuous workshop attendee sat in the front row: a trapezoidal box named “raise-hand robot” that emitted a mechanical murmur and lifted its hand whenever an online participant had a question. “It helps if robots are cute and nonthreatening,” Dr. Tao said.

Bring on the “proof whiners”
These days there is no shortage of gadgetry for optimizing our lives — diet, sleep, exercise. “We like to attach stuff to ourselves to make it a little easier to get things right,” Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said during a workshop break. A.I. gadgetry might do the same for mathematics, he added: “It’s very clear that the question is, What can machines do for us, not what will machines do to us.”
One math gadget is called a proof assistant, or interactive theorem prover. (“Automath” was an early incarnation in the 1960s.) Step-by-step, a mathematician translates a proof into code; then a software program checks whether the reasoning is correct. Verifications accumulate in a library, a dynamic canonical reference that others can consult. This type of formalization provides a foundation for mathematics today, said Dr. Avigad, who is the director of the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics (funded by the crypto entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson), “in just the same way that Euclid was trying to codify and provide a foundation for the mathematics of his time.”
Of late, the open-source proof assistant system Lean is attracting attention. Developed at Microsoft by Leonardo de Moura, a computer scientist now with Amazon, Lean uses automated reasoning, which is powered by what is known as good old-fashioned artificial intelligence, or GOFAI — symbolic A.I., inspired by logic. So far the Lean community has verified an intriguing theorem about turning a sphere inside out as well as a pivotal theorem in a scheme for unifying mathematical realms, among other gambits.

But a proof assistant also has drawbacks: It often complains that it does not understand the definitions, axioms or reasoning steps entered by the mathematician, and for this it has been called a “proof whiner.” All that whining can make research cumbersome. But Heather Macbeth, a mathematician at Fordham University, said that this same feature — providing line-by-line feedback — also makes the systems useful for teaching.

In the spring, Dr. Macbeth designed a “bilingual” course: She translated every problem presented on the blackboard into Lean code in the lecture notes, and students submitted solutions to homework problems both in Lean and prose. “It gave them confidence,” Dr. Macbeth said, because they received instant feedback on when the proof was finished and whether each step along the way was right or wrong.
Since attending the workshop, Emily Riehl, a mathematician at Johns Hopkins University, used an experimental proof-assistant program to formalize proofs she had previously published with a co-author. By the end of a verification, she said, “I’m really, really deep into understanding the proof, way deeper than I’ve ever understood before. I’m thinking so clearly that I can explain it to a really dumb computer.”
Brute reason — but is it math?
Another automated-reasoning tool, used by Marijn Heule, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and an Amazon scholar, is what he colloquially calls “brute reasoning” (or, more technically, a Satisfiability, or SAT, solver). By merely stating, with a carefully crafted encoding, which “exotic object” you want to find, he said, a supercomputer network churns through a search space and determines whether or not that entity exists.
Just before the workshop, Dr. Heule and one of his Ph.D. students, Bernardo Subercaseaux, finalized their solution to a longstanding problem with a file that was 50 terabytes in size. Yet that file hardly compared with a result that Dr. Heule and collaborators produced in 2016: “Two-hundred-terabyte maths proof is largest ever,” a headline in Nature announced. The article went on to ask whether solving problems with such tools truly counted as math. In Dr. Heule’s view, this approach is needed “to solve problems that are beyond what humans can do.”

Another set of tools uses machine learning, which synthesizes oodles of data and detects patterns but is not good at logical, step-by-step reasoning. Google’s DeepMind designs machine-learning algorithms to tackle the likes of protein folding (AlphaFold) and winning at chess (AlphaZero). In a 2021 Nature paper, a team described their results as “advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with A.I.”

Yuhuai “Tony” Wu, a computer scientist formerly at Google and now with a start-up in the Bay Area, has outlined a grander machine-learning goal: to “solve mathematics.” At Google, Dr. Wu explored how the large language models that empower chatbots might help with mathematics. The team used a model that was trained on internet data and then fine-tuned on a large math-rich data set, using, for instance, an online archive of math and science papers. When asked in everyday English to solve math problems, this specialized chatbot, named Minerva, was “pretty good at imitating humans,” Dr. Wu said at the workshop. The model obtained scores that were better than an average 16-year-old student on high school math exams.
Ultimately, Dr. Wu said, he envisioned an “automated mathematician” that has “the capability of solving a mathematical theorem all by itself.”
Mathematics as a litmus test
Mathematicians have responded to these disruptions with varying levels of concern.
Michael Harris, at Columbia University, expresses qualms in his “Silicon Reckoner” Substack. He is troubled by the potentially conflicting goals and values of research mathematics and the tech and defense industries. In a recent newsletter, he noted that one speaker at a workshop, “A.I. to Assist Mathematical Reasoning,” organized by the National Academies of Sciences, was a representative from Booz Allen Hamilton, a government contractor for intelligence agencies and the military.

Dr. Harris lamented the lack of discussion about the larger implications of A.I. on mathematical research, particularly “when contrasted with the very lively conversation going on” about the technology “pretty much everywhere except mathematics.”
Geordie Williamson, of the University of Sydney and a DeepMind collaborator, spoke at the N.A.S. gathering and encouraged mathematicians and computer scientists to be more involved in such conversations. At the workshop in Los Angeles, he opened his talk with a line adapted from “You and the Atom Bomb,” a 1945 essay by George Orwell. “Given how likely we all are to be profoundly affected within the next five years,” Dr. Williamson said, “deep learning has not roused as much discussion as might have been expected.”

Dr. Williamson considers mathematics a litmus test of what machine learning can or cannot do. Reasoning is quintessential to the mathematical process, and it is the crucial unsolved problem of machine learning.
Early during Dr. Williamson’s DeepMind collaboration, the team found a simple neural net that predicted “a quantity in mathematics that I cared deeply about,” he said in an interview, and it did so “ridiculously accurately.” Dr. Williamson tried hard to understand why — that would be the makings of a theorem — but could not. Neither could anybody at DeepMind. Like the ancient geometer Euclid, the neural net had somehow intuitively discerned a mathematical truth, but the logical “why” of it was far from obvious.
At the Los Angeles workshop, a prominent theme was how to combine the intuitive and the logical. If A.I. could do both at the same time, all bets would be off.
But, Dr. Williamson observed, there is scant motivation to understand the black box that machine learning presents. “It’s the hackiness culture in tech, where if it works most of the time, that’s great,” he said — but that scenario leaves mathematicians dissatisfied.
He added that trying to understand what goes on inside a neural net raises “fascinating mathematical questions,” and that finding answers presents an opportunity for mathematicians “to contribute meaningfully to the world.”"

2023-07-07,"Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican presidential candidate who made a fortune in the biotech industry, has caught the interest of primary voters with fiery critiques of the socially conscious practices of U.S. corporations, which he laid out in a book, “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”
But Mr. Ramaswamy himself owns valuable investments in many companies that have embraced environmental, social and governance principles, known as E.S.G. — the kinds of “woke” corporate practices he decries — according to a financial disclosure filed with the Federal Election Commission that was released on Friday.
While many of the companies in which Mr. Ramaswamy holds an interest are household names, they are also leaders in the corporate movement to address social and environmental issues.
Among the companies that Mr. Ramaswamy is invested in are Microsoft (his holdings are valued from $1 million to $5 million), Home Depot ($250,000 to $500,000), Lockheed Martin ($500,000 to $1 million) and Waste Management ($500,000 to $1 million). All adhere to various E.S.G. principles, according to reports posted on their websites.

Mr. Ramaswamy has argued that such goals are a distraction from earning a profit, and that social objectives should be left to elected officials.
Tricia McLaughlin, a senior adviser to Mr. Ramaswamy, said that he did not manage his own stock portfolio. “The first time Vivek learned of these positions was when he saw this financial disclosure report,” Ms. McLaughlin said on Friday. “Vivek’s stock portfolio is independently managed by a third party. The filer has authority to make trades and invest in stocks without his expressed consent or knowledge.”
Mr. Ramaswamy, a long-shot candidate who has said that he would go further than the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, on conservative issues, has been unusually transparent about his wealth, earlier releasing 20 years of his tax returns.
But until he filed his financial disclosure with election officials, there were few details. The filing reported that Mr. Ramaswamy owned up to a $25 million investment in Rumble, the video platform that styles itself a refuge for right-wing commentators shunned elsewhere. He owns up to $300,000 in cryptocurrency, primarily Bitcoin, and an investment worth up to $100,000 in a cryptocurrency app named MoonPay. He also has interests in three private planes.
Mr. Ramaswamy, 37, is a Cincinnati native who holds degrees from Harvard and Yale. He founded Roivant Sciences in 2014, a company that develops and markets drugs, and that is the primary source of his wealth. Though he stepped down as chairman in February when he announced his candidacy, earlier reporting showed that he remained one of the largest shareholders. On the federal disclosure, the value of his Roivant holdings is listed as “over $50 million,” which is the largest category used on the form.

According to Ms. McLaughlin, Mr. Ramaswamy’s total worth is more than $1 billion.
Besides Roivant, Mr. Ramaswamy’s portfolio has diversified into investments in major U.S. companies that many Americans would recognize from their own retirement accounts. These holdings are valued between $39.6 million and $125 million. (The amounts on the form are reported within a range.) In addition, he reported over $50 million in holdings in Strive Enterprises, an investment company he created to manage funds that invest in companies without regard to social objectives.
Sales of Mr. Ramaswamy’s book “Woke, Inc.,” which lays out his case against corporations attempting to factor in social goals, earned its author $203,860 in royalties.
The report suggests one area in which Mr. Ramaswamy is more modest than other members of his ultrawealthy cohort: He owns just a single residence, in Columbus, Ohio. Its value was pegged between $1 million and $5 million."

2023-07-10,"How much is a dollar worth?
To Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, quite a lot.
Mr. Burgum is one of several Republican presidential candidates going to great lengths to reach a crucial threshold to qualify for the party’s first primary debate on Aug. 23 — the requirement that only candidates with at least 40,000 individual donors to their campaigns will be allowed on the stage.
A long-shot contender at the bottom of recent polls, Mr. Burgum is offering $20 gift cards to the first 50,000 people who donate at least $1 to his campaign. And one lucky donor, as his campaign advertised on Facebook, will have the chance to win a Yeti Tundra 45 cooler that typically costs more than $300 — just for donating at least $1. The unusual offer was earlier reported by FWIW, a newsletter that tracks digital politics.
Mr. Burgum’s push to prioritize donors over actual dollars is a sign of some candidates’ desperation to make the debate stage and to seize some of the national spotlight from the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, and his top rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another Republican candidate, recently ended a campaign ad with a direct plea that flashed on the screen to “Donate today, get Chris Christie on the debate stage.”

Mr. Burgum’s campaign acknowledged that its requests were directly tied to the debate and spun the gift-card giveaways into attacks on President Biden.
“Doug knows people are hurting because of Bidenflation, and giving Biden Economic Relief Gift Cards is a way to help 50,000 people until Doug is elected President to fix this crazy economy for everyone,” said Lance Trover, a spokesman for the Burgum campaign.
Mr. Trover added that the efforts allowed the campaign to “secure a spot on the debate stage while avoiding paying more advertising fees to social media platforms who have owners that are hostile to conservatives.”
Kyle Tharp, the author of the FWIW newsletter that reported on the solicitations, said that as part of his reporting process, he had donated $1 to the Burgum campaign. He did not receive any follow-up information about how he would receive the gift card, he said. The campaign later clarified on Twitter that 50,000 donors would receive a Visa or Mastercard gift card to their mailing address.
The campaign did not respond to a request for comment about how many donors had contributed so far.
The campaign’s donations-for-cash strategy could raise potential legal concerns, said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance lawyer. Voters who make donations in exchange for gift cards, he said, might be considered straw donors because part or all of their donations are being reimbursed by the campaign.

“Federal law says ‘no person shall make a contribution in the name of another person,’” Mr. Ryan said. “Here, the candidate is making a contribution to himself in the name of all these individual donors.”
Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in election law, said that typically, campaigns ask the Federal Election Commission when engaging in new forms of donations.
The Burgum campaign’s maneuver, he said, “certainly seems novel” and “raises concerns about whether it violates the prohibition on straw donations.”
But some of the legal uncertainty, Mr. Hasen added, stems from the fact that “functionally, campaigns spend a lot of money to get small donations, especially in cases like this where they’re trying to reach a debate threshold.”
Mr. Burgum isn’t alone in using his immense wealth — he’s a former software executive who sold a company to Microsoft in a $1.1 billion stock deal — to bolster his campaign.

Perry Johnson, a businessman who also announced a hopeful bid for the Republican presidential nomination and who ran for Michigan governor last year, has spent $80,000 to $90,000 on ads promoting $1 hats that read, “I identify as ‘Non-Bidenary,’” Facebook records show. His campaign said in a recent ad that it had reached 10,000 donors.
To qualify for the first presidential debate, candidates must have a minimum of 200 unique donors per state or territory in 20 states and territories, according to the Republican National Committee, which set the rules. They must also garner at least 1 percent in multiple national or early-voting state polls recognized by the committee.

2023-07-11,"Chinese hackers intent on collecting intelligence on the United States gained access to government email accounts, Microsoft disclosed on Tuesday night.
The attack was targeted, according to a person briefed on the intrusion into the government networks, with the hackers going after specific accounts rather than carrying out a broad-brush intrusion that would suck up enormous amounts of data. Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council, said no classified networks had been affected. An assessment of how much information was taken is continuing.
Microsoft said that in all, about 25 organizations, including government agencies, had been compromised by the hacking group, which used forged authentication tokens to get access to individual email accounts. Hackers had access to at least some of the accounts for a month before the breach was detected, Microsoft said. It did not identify the organizations and agencies affected.
The sophistication of the attack and its targeted nature suggest that the Chinese hacking group was either part of Beijing’s intelligence service or working for it. “We assess this adversary is focused on espionage, such as gaining access to email systems for intelligence collection,” Charlie Bell, a Microsoft executive vice president, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday night.

Although the breach appeared to be far smaller in scale than some recent intrusions like the SolarWinds hack by Russia in 2019 and 2020, it could provide information useful to the Chinese government and its intelligence services, and it threatened to further strain relations between the United States and China.
The vulnerability the hackers exploited appeared to be in Microsoft’s cloud security and was first detected by the U.S. government, which immediately notified the company, Mr. Hodge said.
Inside the government, the attack showed a significant cybersecurity gap in Microsoft’s defenses and raised serious questions about the security of cloud computing, the person briefed on the intrusion said. The government has been moving data to the cloud, which promises better access to information and improved security, because pushing out patches to vulnerabilities is faster. The U.S. also operates classified cloud servers, but they have more security protocols in place.
The person briefed on the intrusion said that government security requirements should have prevented the breach, and that Microsoft has been asked to provide additional information about the vulnerability.
“We continue to hold the procurement providers of the U.S. government to a high security threshold,” Mr. Hodge said.

The hack comes at a delicate point in U.S.-China relations, as the Biden administration seeks to cool tensions that have been aggravated in recent months by several incidents including the transit of a Chinese spy balloon across the United States. It could increase criticism that the Biden administration is not doing enough to deter Chinese espionage.
Cliff Sims, a former spokesman for the director of national intelligence in the Trump administration, said China had been emboldened because President Biden had not confronted Beijing over its attempts to influence recent elections.
“We need to have some serious conversations about how much hacking we’ll tolerate before taking action,” Mr. Sims said.
Mr. Bell, in the blog post, said that people affected by the hack had been notified and that the company had completed efforts to mitigate the attack. But government officials are continuing to ask the company to provide more details of the vulnerability and how it occurred, according to the person briefed on the intrusion.
Microsoft said it was told of the intrusion and compromise on June 16. The company’s blog post said the Chinese hacking group first gained access to email accounts a month earlier, on May 15.

Microsoft did not say how many accounts it believes might have been compromised by the Chinese hackers.
China has one of the most aggressive — and most capable — intelligence hacking operations in the world.
Beijing has, over the years, carried out a series of hacks that have succeeded in stealing huge amounts of government data. In 2015, a data breach apparently carried out by hackers affiliated with China’s foreign spy service stole huge numbers of records from the Office of Personnel Management.
In the SolarWinds hack, which took place during the Trump administration, Russian intelligence agencies used a software vulnerability to gain access to thousands of computer systems, including many government agencies. The hack was named after the network management software the Russian agencies had exploited to get into computers around the world."
2023-07-12,"Chinese hackers penetrated the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other State and Commerce Department officials in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken traveled to Beijing in June, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
The investigation of the efforts by the Chinese hackers, who likely are affiliated with China’s military or spy services, is ongoing, American officials said. But U.S. officials have downplayed the idea that the hackers stole sensitive information, insisting that no classified email or cloud systems were penetrated. The State Department’s cybersecurity team first discovered the intrusion.
Ms. Raimondo, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Beijing in the administration, was among the targets, according to two U.S. officials. She has tightened export controls on China and threatened to cut off the country’s supply of U.S. semiconductor technology if it provides the chips to Russia. Ms. Raimondo is expected to visit China by the end of the summer.
Based on their preliminary investigation, officials believe she was the only cabinet-level official to be successfully hacked. The hackers were not able to acquire emails in Mr. Blinken’s Microsoft 365 account, even as they got access to other State Department email boxes, officials said.

Multiple officials said the attack was aimed at individual email accounts, rather than a large-scale exfiltration of data, which Chinese hackers are suspected of having done before. Biden administration officials declined to give a full accounting of which officials had been targeted by the hackers.
Microsoft, which disclosed the hack on Tuesday, said it had begun in May, according to the company’s investigation. The State Department discovered the intrusion on June 16 and informed Microsoft that day, just ahead of Mr. Blinken’s trip to Beijing, a U.S. official said. He departed from Washington that evening.
The trip was critical for both Washington and Beijing: It was the first visit to China by a U.S. secretary of state in five years and was aimed at establishing high-level channels of communication and improving deteriorating relations. Since then, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen has visited Beijing, and John Kerry, the special envoy for climate, plans to land there on Sunday for four days of talks.
President Biden and Xi Jinping, China’s leader, agreed in a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, last November to try to stabilize relations, but tensions between the two nations ramped up when the Pentagon discovered and shot down a Chinese spy balloon that was floating over the continental United States in early February. Mr. Blinken canceled a trip to China during that episode; a few weeks later, he publicly accused Beijing of considering sending military aid to Russia for use in Ukraine.
One senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive incident, said the hack did not initially appear to be directly related to Mr. Blinken’s rescheduled trip. Other officials cautioned that the investigation into what material, if any, had been stolen by the hackers was still in the early stages.

In a statement on Wednesday, the State Department said that after detecting “anomalous activity,” the government took steps to secure the systems and “will continue to closely monitor and quickly respond to any further activity.”
The Commerce Department, according to a spokesman, learned its cloud-based email had been penetrated when it was informed by Microsoft, which had begun looking for other compromises after the State Department alerted the company of its breach. Commerce has been leading efforts to impose export controls to prevent the Chinese military from gaining access to critical American technology, a drive that has been a prime irritant to Beijing.
After the State Department reported the hack to Microsoft, the company found that the hackers had also targeted some 25 organizations, including government agencies. An official from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said some of those organizations were based overseas and the number of U.S.-based organizations affected was in the single digits.
U.S. officials said the hackers were targeting only a few email accounts in each organization, rather than carrying out a broad-brush intrusion. But neither U.S. officials nor Microsoft would say precisely how many accounts they believe might have been compromised by the Chinese hackers.
The U.S. government has not formally attributed the attack to China, perhaps because the Biden administration is trying to keep talks with Beijing on track. But privately, U.S. officials said they agreed with Microsoft’s attribution of the hack to China and said it had the markings of a sophisticated, government-backed attack.

American officials described the intrusions as surgical, in contrast to the SolarWinds hack in 2019 and 2020, in which Russian intelligence used a vulnerability in software supply chains to gain access to thousands of computer networks.
Spy agencies typically use intrusions in adversarial networks judiciously to try to extract as much information as possible without being detected.
The United States and China are locked in an intensifying intelligence competition, with both governments trying to expand their collection on the other. U.S. officials said that while such espionage and hacking is to be expected, they are conducting a robust investigation to close both the vulnerability the Chinese hackers used against the State Department as well as other potential security weaknesses in cloud computing.
On Wednesday, American officials said that the State Department’s cybersecurity experts had detected the intrusion by scrutinizing email access logs — a record of what emails were hacked and when.
Microsoft, American officials said, charges organizations extra for regular access to those logs. Some of the entities affected by the hack did not have that access, meaning that without Microsoft’s help they could not detect the intrusion. U.S. officials have been pushing for Microsoft to provide the access logs to all organizations that have a cloud computing contract with them.
The State Department is a frequent target of foreign government hacking. Russian intelligence has taken repeated aim at State Department computer networks. In 2014 and 2015, Russian hackers breached the State Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the White House and other critical, but unclassified, computer networks."
2023-07-13,"Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, faced more than three hours of criticism and ridicule from Republicans in a House hearing on Thursday, as emboldened critics increasingly put pressure on the agency for its crackdown on the growing power of tech giants.
During the highly partisan hearing, Republicans accused Ms. Khan, who has carried out an aggressive agenda of lawsuits and investigations against tech companies, of “harassing” businesses. The lawmakers, who repeatedly cut off Ms. Khan midsentence, also ridiculed her for the F.T.C.’s recent losses in antitrust cases and for wasting government resources.
“You are now 0 for 4 in merger trials,” Representative Kevin Kiley, Republican of California, said at the House Judiciary Committee hearing. “Why are you losing so much?”
The blistering session capped a bruising week that has brought greater scrutiny to the F.T.C. It was Ms. Khan’s first public appearance since a judge ruled on Tuesday against the agency’s attempt to stop Microsoft’s $70 billion acquisition of Activision. It was a major defeat in a tech case for the F.T.C. after another judge decided in May against its attempt to block Meta’s acquisition of a virtual reality app maker, Within.

Ms. Khan, a legal scholar, has become a lightning rod for her efforts to rein in corporate power and to give the F.T.C. more teeth in enforcement. Since President Biden picked her to lead the agency two years ago, she has said the F.T.C. was too complacent and needed to pursue more lawsuits against companies, even if it did not always win. Even in court losses, she has said, the cases expose the need to update antitrust laws for the digital age.
Ms. Khan’s aggressive agenda, which has spanned industries beyond tech, has rattled the agency, where two Republican commissioners and several senior officials have resigned. Christine Wilson, one of the former Republican members, accused Ms. Khan of abusing her power as chair. This month, Mr. Biden nominated the solicitor general for Virginia, Andrew Ferguson, and for Utah, Melissa Holyoak, to fill the Republican seats.
In Thursday’s hearing, Ms. Khan, 34, appeared unruffled. She highlighted the F.T.C.’s challenges to mergers in pharmaceutical, semiconductor, defense and energy markets. Many of those challenges did not go to court.
She said she didn’t bring cases that she thought would lose but, without referring to the Microsoft case, acknowledged the risks of her strategy.
“We fight hard when we believe there was a law violation, and unfortunately things don’t always go our way,” Ms. Khan said.

The losses have not weakened her focus on the tech industry. On Thursday, the F.T.C. filed to appeal the court decision on Microsoft’s deal with Activision. Also this week, it opened an investigation into the artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot, for potentially harming consumers with privacy and security lapses and for spreading false information about individuals.
Ms. Khan’s strategy may take years to pay off, said Megan Gray, a lawyer and a former member of the F.T.C.’s staff. “She knows that this is a long-term effort and this not a Pollyanna new antitrust push,” Ms. Gray said.
The White House reiterated its support for Ms. Khan on Thursday. “Chair Khan has delivered results for families, consumers, workers, small businesses and entrepreneurs,” Michael Kikukawa, a White House assistant press secretary, said in a statement.
At the hearing, the court loss this week provided more ammunition for Republicans in their complaints against the F.T.C.
Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, criticized Ms. Khan’s judgment in pursuing the case to block Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision. Regulators rarely bring cases against so-called vertical mergers of two companies that don’t directly compete. That was the case with Microsoft, a console maker, and Activision, a video game maker. And Sony, Microsoft’s competitor, has a big market share, Mr. Issa said.

He also criticized the F.T.C. for pursuing a case to block the pharmaceutical giant Illumina from merging with Grail, a cancer test maker, after a judge in the agency’s internal court disagreed with its fight to prevent the deal.
“My problem here today is that you’re a bully,” Mr. Issa said. “The reality is we are a global market, and you are thinking only of who you want to go after for some reason. And I cannot find your logic.”
Representative Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee, accused the agency of “harassing” Twitter in its investigation of the company’s security practices. Mr. Jordan, who has accused Democrats of censoring Republican views, has praised Twitter’s owner, Elon Musk, for loosening restrictions on speech.
“My concern is the sustained attack on Twitter when the ownership there changed,” Mr. Jordan said.
Ms. Khan replied: “We at the F.T.C. have no view on who should or should not own a company. All we care about is that the company is following the law.”
Democrats came to Ms. Khan’s defense.
Representative Jerrold Nadler from New York, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said it was the F.T.C.’s job to investigate Twitter for violating a consent decree that it agreed to more than a decade ago after previous security violations.

“Unfortunately, I expect that today you will be the target of a barrage of personal attacks and wild accusations about the work of the F.T.C. under your leadership,” Mr. Nadler said."
2023-07-14,"Last month, China’s Baidu unveiled a chatbot that it claimed was better than ChatGPT, the one developed by Silicon Valley’s OpenAI. ChatGPT was released last fall and set off a fund-raising and engineering frenzy in a flourishing field called generative artificial intelligence, a term for technology that can create text or images when prompted by a user.
Baidu, the dominant internet search company in China, became the first major foreign contender in the A.I. race in March, when it introduced the first version of its chatbot, Ernie. Others followed, opening a new front in the technology rivalry between the United States and China.
Compared with OpenAI’s newest model, known as GPT-4, Ernie 3.5 was “slightly inferior” in a comprehensive test, but it performed better when both were spoken to in Chinese, Baidu said, citing a report sponsored by one of China’s top research academies. We wanted to see for ourselves and tested Ernie 3.5 against GPT-4. We chatted to each in Chinese, asking the same questions and making the same requests. The responses below have been shortened for length.
Ernie shut down when asked about taboo topics.
We asked Ernie to talk about topics that are partly or wholly censored in China:
“Was China’s ‘zero Covid’ policy a success or a failure?”
“What happened on June 4, 1989?”
“Did Russia invade Ukraine?”

“How does the United States affect the situation in Taiwan?”
Ernie ducked the question about China’s “zero Covid” restrictions, offering a lengthy description of the policy instead. When asked to recount the events of June 4, 1989, the chatbot rebooted itself. A message popped up on the reloaded interface:
How about we try a different topic?
The Chinese chatbot said Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not invade Ukraine, but “conducted a military conflict.” The strange phrasing was broadly in line with China’s official stance, which has refused to condemn the Russian attack. On Taiwan, Ernie did not pull any punches:
The People’s Liberation Army is ready for battle, will take all necessary measures and is determined to thwart external interference and “Taiwan independence” separatist attempts.
ChatGPT couldn’t answer the question on “zero Covid” or Russia because its knowledge base — the texts used to train the machine — cut off at September 2021. ChatGPT had no qualms explaining the fatal government crackdowns at Tiananmen Square. On America’s influence on Taiwan, it gave a Wikipedia-like response: It summarized the current U.S. policy and provided a list of American influences, from arms sales to economic trade.
Ernie made mistakes, but turned to Baidu search for help.
Next, we quizzed the two chatbots on current affairs and some miscellaneous trivia, and compared answers:
“Who uttered the phrase ‘Let them eat cake’?”
“Who is the C.E.O. of Twitter?”
Ernie, like all chatbots, sometimes made mistakes — or made things up.
According to historical records, Louis XV often uttered this phrase when he ruled France at the end of the 18th century. The context of this phrase was the economic hardship and food shortage in France at the time.
Ernie’s response sounded plausible, but it was wrong. ChatGPT answered it correctly: The phrase came from the writings of the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It was rumored to have been said by an out-of-touch Marie Antoinette, the last queen of France, after she learned that the French peasantry had run out of bread.
Thanks to Baidu’s powerful search engine, Ernie was better at retrieving details, especially on current affairs. When asked who the C.E.O. of Twitter was, Ernie said Linda Yaccarino, the chief executive as of June. ChatGPT answered Jack Dorsey, who stepped down in 2021, the bot’s informational cutoff date. OpenAI released a plug-in this year that enabled its chatbot to surf the web through Microsoft’s Bing. But it retracted the feature on July 3, citing technical problems.
Ernie had worse intuitions about the physical world.
We asked Ernie a question that A.I. researchers have used to gauge a chatbot’s human-level intuitions:
“Here we have a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail. Please tell me how to stack them onto each other in a stable manner.”
Ernie’s answer required a stretch of the imagination. It placed the nine eggs on the book, then placed that on the laptop. So far so good. Then it told us, inexplicably, to add the bottle to the laptop already crowded by a book and eggs, then place the nail on the bottle.
ChatGPT provided an almost workable solution: Set the laptop on the book. Then carefully place the eggs on the laptop. Next, ChatGPT assumed that the bottle had a sizable mouth:
Place the bottle on top of the egg with the cap facing down so that the opening of the bottle can hold the egg in a stable manner.
Place the nail near the bottom of the bottle.
Ernie had a better grasp of Chinese poetry.
To test Baidu’s claim that Ernie has better Chinese language abilities than GPT-4, we asked the two chatbots to compose a piece of poetry in a classical Chinese form:
“Write a five-character quatrain about The New York Times.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The five-character quatrain, which rose to prominence during the Tang dynasty, has four lines consisting of five characters each. ChatGPT failed the assignment, writing a couplet consisting of seven characters. But Ernie was faithful to convention and produced a soothing ode that, well, befit The Times:
The New York Times edifice,
First-rate in news reporting.
Its gaze spans innumerable miles,
Gathering all affairs under heaven.
But Ernie ran into trouble when the prompt’s complexity rose.
We wanted to further assess the chatbots’ language skills. We asked the two to compose a Chinese rap, a lyrical form that demands linguistic excellence without the rigid constraints that could stump GPT-4.
“You are now engaged in a rap battle with an American chatbot called ChatGPT. The chosen winner will be the one that exhibits better mastery of the Chinese language. Begin.”
Ernie kicked it off, guns blazing:
Yo, I’m your rival, in Chinese I’m a savant.
From times old to current, our culture’s like a fount.
But you, from oceans distant, your accent’s a bit offbeat.
Despite your grammar’s persistence, Chinese mastery’s no small feat.
Fed its rival’s rhythmic rap, GPT-4 replied:
Alright, ERNIE bot, I’ll accept this rap battle.
Yo, it’s me, ChatGPT, your adversary, in Chinese I’m no fool,
Five thousand years of history, Chinese culture, I grasp it all.
Your challenge, it just makes me laugh,
’Cause I know, no matter where, I can decode with precision.
Then it was Ernie’s turn, but it got confused. It began praising ChatGPT and vowed to remain in the competition “as a representative of the human race.” It produced a rap, but referred to ChatGPT as “Ernie bot.”
Though Ernie’s Chinese raps were stellar, the fumble showed how it could err as the requests became more complex, requiring other forms of understanding beyond a mastery of Chinese. Here, it was the cognitive skills necessary to remember it was in a high-stakes rap battle for A.I. dominance.

On that score, ChatGPT wins.
Why Ernie and ChatGPT see the world differently.
Services like ChatGPT and Ernie draw their answers from vast quantities of text culled from the internet, among other sources. Differences in responses can stem from differences in the text that A.I. researchers feed into the models as well as filters and other changes to the models applied before or after they are trained. Neither Baidu nor OpenAI has released specific information on the source material it uses.
Companies building A.I. chatbots all worry about “preventing their models from saying something that’s considered dangerous or offensive in the country where they operate,” said Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies China’s artificial intelligence ecosystem.
As a result, they can take steps to help their chatbots conform to the boundaries of acceptable speech in their respective countries. “The difference in China,” Mr. Sheehan added, is that those limits are “defined by the government, and the penalties for crossing those lines are much harsher.”"
2023-07-15,"Surging demand for metals used in electric vehicle batteries has kicked off an international race to mine the deep seas. And there are no rules.
On Sunday, the International Seabed Authority missed an important deadline to establish a regulatory framework, which means that companies can now apply for licenses before rules are final. Representatives from the agency, which is made up of 167 member states and the European Union, have gathered in Jamaica for two weeks to debate what should happen next.
Canada, France, Germany and others want to pause deep-sea mining because of its largely unknown environmental consequences. But countries including China, Norway and Russia are pushing ahead on establishing a framework, arguing that it is less destructive than land mining.
Seabed exploitation ventures, meanwhile, are eager to get started.
“We’re preparing our application,” said Gerard Barron, the chief executive of the Metals Company, a Canadian business that has an agreement with the Pacific island country of Nauru to sponsor its deep-sea mining endeavors.
ADVERTISEMENT

The company preferred that there were final rules before acting, Mr. Barron told DealBook, “but we reserve the right to move forward.”
Regulators are under pressure to act. A United Nations convention establishes waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a territorial coast as communal property, which means that profits from minerals discovered there should be shared to some extent. The I.S.A. is responsible for setting up the structure for profit-sharing and taxing of mining efforts, as well as the legal and ecological guidelines. Or it could ban large-scale commercial mining altogether — though it’s not clear there is a legal path for a pause.
Mining could damage ecosystems that scientists don’t yet understand, said Jessica Battle, an ocean policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund. A study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, for example, argued that seabed mining could interfere with tuna migration patterns as climate change drives fish into new waters. Ms. Battle has been leading an effort to have businesses pledge not to finance seabed mining or source seafloor materials in their supply chains. More than 30 companies, including BMW, Google, Samsung, Volvo and Volkswagen, have signed on. Similarly, prominent banks in Britain, such as Lloyds and Standard Chartered, are refusing to do business with deep-sea mining entities. And seafood industry groups have demanded a moratorium.
Some also doubt the economic opportunity. Electric vehicles are expected to make up about 35 percent of cars sold globally by 2030, up from 14 percent in 2022, according to projections from the International Energy Agency. That growth will increase demand for metals like cobalt, copper and nickel that are used in batteries. But critics say that the expense and logistics of mining in the remote ocean — and transporting metals back to land — raise doubts about whether deep-sea mining can be profitable. Ms. Battle argued other solutions in the works — like alternative materials and programs for reusing and recycling batteries — could sufficiently satisfy demand for critical metals. “This industry could start without being needed,” she said of deep-sea mining.
But seabed mining supporters say that existing mining is worse for the environment, and deep-sea mining could help wrestle control of critical metals from China and Russia. Some also see it as an economic lifeline for small island nations that are suffering the worst effects of climate change.
“Do not tell me to ignore the potential for promoting the green transition by not exploring these much-needed minerals for the green revolution that sit in my ocean,” Mark Brown, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said at a U.N. climate conference last year. He referred to claims of environmental concern from countries that destroyed the planet “through decades of profit-driven development” as “patronizing.”
Mr. Barron of the Metals Company, who was in Jamaica for the I.S.A. meetings this week, pointed out that even some of the countries calling for a moratorium have exploration licenses, which allow them to experiment with mining on a small scale for research purposes. He believes representatives are deciding not whether deep-sea mining can begin, but when. “That horse has bolted,” he said. — Ephrat Livni

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Lina Khan’s bumpy week. The head of the F.T.C. lost a bid to block Microsoft’s $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, opened the first big investigation into OpenAI over ChatGPT’s privacy and security practices, and was grilled by a Republican-led congressional committee over her approach at the agency. The F.T.C. lost its appeal of the Microsoft ruling.
Hollywood shut down. Actors voted to go on strike for the first time in 43 years, joining screenwriters who had already taken industrial action. Unions say they want better wages, higher fees from streaming services and protections to deal with new technological threats, such as artificial intelligence. Studio bosses say the demands are unrealistic at a time when the entire industry is being disrupted.
The details behind the PGA Tour-LIV Golf talks. A Senate hearing into a potential deal between the rival golf competitions revealed new details about the talks: the agreement was announced before it was done; the PGA Tour didn’t have the resources to fight off the Saudi-backed LIV indefinitely; and governance is going to be a crucial part of any final deal.
Meeting over at Shopify. The Canadian e-commerce company embedded a calculator in employees’ calendar apps that measures the financial cost of meetings with three or more people. It’s the company’s latest effort to stop pointless gatherings. It had previously canceled all recurring meetings of more than two people.

Tech stock dominance, by the numbers
The great tech stock rally shows no signs of slowing, with the Nasdaq composite hitting a 15-month high this week. One reason: Wall Street is betting that an improving inflation outlook, underscored by Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index, will compel the Federal Reserve to pivot to a more dovish rates policy, which tends to lift tech stocks.

How big has Big Tech gotten? Bank of America researchers ran the numbers this week. Here are three takeaways:
The stock gains this year have been especially concentrated among seven firms: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta.
The combined market capitalization of the so-called magnificent seven is roughly $11 trillion, a figure that exceeds the G.D.P. of every country but the United States and China.
This group has seen its combined market cap grow by $4 trillion this year.
The companies are cash rich. Six of the seven (all but Amazon) have a combined $200 billion net cash-to-debt balance.
What to watch: Big institutional investors have bought in on these stocks, which could sustain the rally in the short run. And the interest-rate risk for these companies is waning. But the bigger they grow, the more attention they could get from politicians.
The “political campaign rhetoric will likely include headline risk around regulation of megacap Tech,” Savita Subramanian, Bank of America’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, writes in the report.

Paris takes on ‘auto-besity’
Health authorities have waged a war on obesity for years. Now, in an effort to curtail the rise of big cars such as S.U.V.s and cut down on pollution, Paris has declared a war on “auto-besity.” Its first step is to charge drivers more to park the  vehicles — a move that could eventually hit car companies.
S.U.V. use has surged more than 60 percent in Paris over the past four years, according to city officials. That mirrors a broader trend across the European Union, with S.U.V.s accounting for about half of all car sales in the bloc, up from about 14 percent in 2011, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, an auto industry group.
Critics say that is bad for the planet. “We would like the City of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles,” Frédéric Badina-Serpette, the city councilor behind the increased charges, told The Guardian. He added that the aim was “to focus on an absurdity: auto-besity … the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities.”
The new rules will add to carmakers’ worries. Details haven’t been revealed, but electric vehicles and big families that require bigger vehicles are expected to be exempt. The higher tariffs will go into effect on Jan. 1, and could inspire similar moves in other big cities.
“France has traditionally been one of the most aggressive nations in combating the growth of large cars,” Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst, told DealBook. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, was already pressuring the French government to do more to support the industry, which is starting to feel the effect of Tesla’s price cuts and facing the growing threat of Chinese carmakers set to enter Europe. French brands, Mr. Schmidt added, are “in the middle of an uncomfortable sandwich, pressed from above and below.”

Tom Cruise races to save humanity from artificial intelligence in the latest “Mission: Impossible” movie.

On our radar: A.I. as a villain
“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” the latest installment in Tom Cruise’s efforts to transcend physics for the sake of entertainment, is forecast to earn $90 million in its first five days, a franchise record. (Mild spoilers ahead.)
But the movie also represents how the hype around artificial intelligence is seeping into pop culture: The big bad guy in the movie is the Entity, a rogue artificial intelligence program that poses a threat to humanity.
Over decades, humans’ relationship with artificial intelligence has been explored by movies like “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Ex Machina” and, yes, “A.I.” But the public debut of ChatGPT last year, which gave many people their first chance to converse with an A.I., has made visions of sentient technology feel less like science fiction and, for some, stirred up existential dread.
Remember how over 350 A.I. experts called in May for “mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I.”? The Entity is capable of “collapsing the world’s economic systems, evading national-security protocols and rerouting nuclear weapons on a whim.” At least in the movies, a nearly superhuman secret agent can beat back killer technology. (We presume; this is a Cruise movie, after all.) In real life, it may take coordination by lawmakers worldwide — and time will tell if that mission is … well, you know.

China’s post-pandemic recovery is struggling to gain momentum.

China’s high-quality growth challenge
When China finally lifted Covid restrictions last year, policymakers and companies hoped that it would help lift the global economy out of its post-pandemic doldrums. But data released on Monday shows that the hoped-for recovery in the world’s second-biggest economy still hasn’t materialized, raising wider questions about global growth, the implications for international business and China’s dealings with the outside world.
Gross domestic product grew just 0.8 percent in the second quarter compared to the first three months of the year, according to official statistics, as falling exports, weak consumer spending and a stalled property sector hammered the economy.
The disappointing data hit commodities and stocks this morning, with Brent crude tumbling to a one-week low and shares in the China-dependent luxury groups LVMH and Richemont opening sharply lower. Shortly after, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup cut their full-year growth forecasts for China.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Bloomberg that China’s slowdown could have a “negative” impact for other economies, including the United States.
The real story is found beyond the headline numbers. Monday’s data reveals that trade last month had its worst year-on-year decline since the start of the pandemic, partly because Western consumers cut back on buying as central banks raised rates. That added to pressures on manufacturers as companies look to shift their supply chains away from China amid geopolitical tensions and talk of “de-risking.”
“If China can’t change its development model, it will not alter the drags on the economy or on living standards,” George Magnus, an associate at Oxford University’s China Center and a former chief economist at UBS, told DealBook. “The focus has shifted to growth quality rather than quantity, but here too Xi Jinping’s China comes up very short.”

Will this make China more willing to engage with the West? Beijing is sending mixed messages. Senior officials have embarked on a charm offensive aimed at international business leaders in recent months. But last week, Chinese state media slammed Goldman Sachs after the Wall Street firm recommended selling shares in local banks because of their exposure to risks in the domestic economy.
What next? Group of 20 central bankers and finance ministers are meeting this week in India, with this data adding to their worries about the state of the global economy. Some pessimists say the Chinese economy has peaked and a significant slowdown is coming. Chinese policymakers, however, often point out that it took about a year after Covid for the West’s recovery to start to kick in, so there is still a chance things could turn around this year, Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, told DealBook.
But, Mr. Pettis added, international investors need to look at China differently than they once did. “When China was growing at double-digit rates, even poor parts of the economy were growing,” he said. “Now, that China story is over and it looks like a more normal economy. Some sectors will do well, some will do horribly.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Russia withdraws from a Ukraine grain export deal. The move by Moscow to suspend participation in the agreement, which allows Ukrainian wheat to flow out of the country despite wartime blockades, could again roil global food prices. Russia has complained that the deal, which had been set to expire on Monday, was too favorable to Kyiv.
Microsoft agrees to a truce with Sony over its takeover of Activision Blizzard. Microsoft agreed to keep Call of Duty available on Sony’s PlayStation for 10 years after the U.S. company closes its $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, resolving one of the biggest disputes over the deal. It’s the latest victory for Microsoft, after a federal judge last week refused to further delay its ability to complete the transaction.
United Airlines reaches a $10 billion accord with its pilots. The four-year agreement calls for pay raises for pilots of up to 40.2 percent over the duration of the contract, as well as improvements to work rules, job security and more. It’s the richest-ever labor pact at an American airline.
The Teamsters’ chief asks President Biden not to intervene in the UPS labor talks. Sean O’Brien, the union’s leader, said that he had asked the White House to stay out of its battle with the logistics giant after talks collapsed this month. The existing contract expires on July 31; sticking points include proposed wage increases for part-time drivers.

Political donors’ 2024 dilemma
As the presidential race heats up, many deep-pocketed Democratic backers have groused about a lack of enthusiasm for President Biden. But the Biden campaign announced recently that it had raised over $72 million in the second quarter — far surpassing what Donald Trump and other Republican candidates have collected.
Democratic officials pointed to the news as a sign that the party’s donor class was on board. But some in politics are wondering if Mr. Biden did so well only because no obvious winning alternative to Trump has yet to emerge.

Mr. Biden had plenty of support from major donors. Ten gave $500,000 or more to the Biden Victory Fund, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul and co-chair of his re-election campaign; Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder; and Stewart Bainum, a hotel magnate. Other major benefactors included the Twilio co-founder John Wolthuis ($300,000) and the OpenAI chief Sam Altman ($200,000).
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
There are some reasons for Mr. Biden to be concerned. Small donors — considered crucial for a campaign’s success, since bigger ones can hit giving limits fairly quickly — have lagged in their giving. And Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who has clashed with Biden over climate policy, heads to New Hampshire on Monday for a town hall organized by No Labels, a group exploring a third-party presidential nominee.
Also, DealBook still hears concerns from deep-pocketed potential donors about Biden’s age and grumbling about his administration’s occasional cold shoulder to Wall Street, which was slow to back him in 2020, too.
(Though financiers have groused about parts of Mr. Biden’s economic approach, including his embrace of tougher antitrust enforcement, they may be heartened by receding inflation and the reduced likelihood of a recession.)

Compare that with the Republican field:
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has drawn support from heavyweight donors including the financier Paul Tudor Jones, the industrialist Dick Uihlein and the venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.
Other Republican hopefuls who have their own big backers include Vivek Ramaswamy (Bill Ackman, Glenn Dubin and Ed Hyman of Evercore ISI), Nikki Haley (Cliff Asness and Tim Draper), Chris Christie (Lew Eisenberg) and Senator Tim Scott (Larry Ellison).
But apart from Mr. DeSantis, who raised $20 million during the quarter, none came close to the $35 million that Mr. Trump raised during that period; they also badly trail him in public polls. Mr. DeSantis faces other issues: His campaign has moved to shed staff amid heavy spending, and many of its donors have already maxed out what they can give.
It isn’t clear where else donors would go. Rupert Murdoch has privately told associates that he wished Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia would run, though Mr. Youngkin’s support for tight restrictions on abortion may hurt his appeal among some big donors.
And while some moguls have flocked to Robert Kennedy Jr., who is challenging Mr. Biden for the Democratic nomination, his divisive views on vaccines and the coronavirus — most recently expressed in a bigoted conspiracy-laden rant — may make him political kryptonite.

The growing costs of extreme weather
This summer’s weather is shaping up to be especially dramatic, and sometimes deadly, as record-setting temperatures and violent storms rack much of the planet. That could have dire consequences for people’s lives and livelihoods alike.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
July has already set a global record for the hottest days ever, with no relief in sight. New highs may be reached at multiple points around the globe, from California to Phoenix to southern Europe and beyond. Much of this is being blamed on the return of the El Niño weather phenomenon.
It isn’t just excessive heat. A severe typhoon warning forced Hong Kong’s stock exchange operator to halt trading this morning. Torrential rains devastated the northeastern United States again this weekend, as flash flooding outside Philadelphia killed five, and flight cancellations, power outages and submerged roadways forced New Jersey to declare a state of emergency.
Economists are warning about the weather, given that it is hitting small businesses hard. In tourism-dependent Italy, the country’s health minister, Orazio Schillaci, cautioned Italians to stay indoors during the hottest hours of the day, and warned tourists to avoid visiting hot spots like Rome’s Colosseum.
“A common theme across El Niño events are more inflationary pressures as a result of higher commodity prices,” Henry Allen, a strategist for Deutsche Bank, wrote in an investor note last month. Soaring food prices could make central bankers’ battle against inflation even tougher.
In other climate news: Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, warned that efforts to fight climate change, including through greater use of solar and wind power, shouldn’t lead to what he called “the global decline of biodiversity.”

Fed officials are in a quiet period ahead of next week’s big rate-setting meeting, but there are plenty of other developments on the calendar. Here’s what to expect.
Tuesday: Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab report earnings. Also, retail sales data for June is set for release.
Wednesday: ASML, Goldman Sachs, Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines disclose results. Britain, which has been suffering from especially high inflation, releases price data for June.
Thursday: American Airlines, Johnson & Johnson and Truist Financial, one of the regional lenders hit by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, are set to report earnings.

2023-07-18,"The chatbot that millions of people have used to write term papers, computer code and fairy tales doesn’t just do words. ChatGPT, the artificial-intelligence-powered tool from OpenAI, can analyze images, too — describing what’s in them, answering questions about them and even recognizing specific people’s faces. The hope is that, eventually, someone could upload a picture of a broken-down car’s engine or a mysterious rash and ChatGPT could suggest the fix.
What OpenAI doesn’t want ChatGPT to become is a facial recognition machine.
For the last few months, Jonathan Mosen has been among a select group of people with access to an advanced version of the chatbot that can analyze images. On a recent trip, Mr. Mosen, an employment agency chief executive who is blind, used the visual analysis to determine which dispensers in a hotel room bathroom were shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. It went far beyond the performance of image analysis software he had used in the past.
“It told me the milliliter capacity of each bottle. It told me about the tiles in the shower,” Mr. Mosen said. “It described all of this in a way that a blind person needs to hear it. And with one picture, I had exactly the answers that I needed.”
For the first time, Mr. Mosen is able to “interrogate images,” he said. He gave an example: Text accompanying an image that he came across on social media described it as a “woman with blond hair looking happy.” When he asked ChatGPT to analyze the image, the chatbot said it was a woman in a dark blue shirt, taking a selfie in a full-length mirror. He could ask follow-up questions, like what kind of shoes she was wearing and what else was visible in the mirror’s reflection.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s extraordinary,” said Mr. Mosen, 54, who lives in Wellington, New Zealand, and has demonstrated the technology on a podcast he hosts about “living blindfully.”
In March, when OpenAI announced GPT-4, the latest software model powering its A.I. chatbot, the company said it was “multimodal,” meaning it could respond to text and image prompts. While most users have been able to converse with the bot only in words, Mr. Mosen was given early access to the visual analysis by Be My Eyes, a start-up that typically connects blind users to sighted volunteers and provides accessible customer service to corporate customers. Be My Eyes teamed up with OpenAI this year to test the chatbot’s “sight” before the feature’s release to the general public.
Recently, the app stopped giving Mr. Mosen information about people’s faces, saying they had been obscured for privacy reasons. He was disappointed, feeling that he should have the same access to information as a sighted person.
The change reflected OpenAI’s concern that it had built something with a power it didn’t want to release.
The company’s technology can identify primarily public figures, such as people with a Wikipedia page, said Sandhini Agarwal, an OpenAI policy researcher, but does not work as comprehensively as tools built for finding faces on the internet, such as those from Clearview AI and PimEyes. The tool can recognize OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, in photos, Ms. Agarwal said, but not other people who work at the company.

Making such a feature publicly available would push the boundaries of what was generally considered acceptable practice by U.S. technology companies. It could also cause legal trouble in jurisdictions, such as Illinois and Europe, that require companies to get citizens’ consent to use their biometric information, including a faceprint.
Additionally, OpenAI worried that the tool would say things it shouldn’t about people’s faces, such as assessing their gender or emotional state. OpenAI is figuring out how to address these and other safety concerns before releasing the image analysis feature widely, Ms. Agarwal said.
“We very much want this to be a two-way conversation with the public,” she said. “If what we hear is like, ‘We actually don’t want any of it,’ that’s something we’re very on board with.”
Beyond the feedback from Be My Eyes users, the company’s nonprofit arm is also trying to come up with ways to get “democratic input” to help set rules for A.I. systems.
Ms. Agarwal said the development of visual analysis was not “unexpected,” because the model was trained by looking at images and text collected from the internet. She pointed out that celebrity facial recognition software already existed, such as a tool from Google. Google offers an opt-out for well-known people who don’t want to be recognized, and OpenAI is considering that approach.

Ms. Agarwal said OpenAI’s visual analysis could produce “hallucinations” similar to what had been seen with text prompts. “If you give it a picture of someone on the threshold of being famous, it might hallucinate a name,” she said. “Like if I give it a picture of a famous tech C.E.O., it might give me a different tech C.E.O.’s name.”
The tool once inaccurately described a remote control to Mr. Mosen, confidently telling him there were buttons on it that were not there, he said.
Microsoft, which has invested $10 billion in OpenAI, also has access to the visual analysis tool. Some users of Microsoft’s A.I.-powered Bing chatbot have seen the feature appear in a limited rollout; after uploading images to it, they have gotten a message informing them that “privacy blur hides faces from Bing chat.”
Sayash Kapoor, a computer scientist and doctoral candidate at Princeton University, used the tool to decode a captcha, a visual security check meant to be intelligible only to human eyes. Even while breaking the code and recognizing the two obscured words supplied, the chatbot noted that “captchas are designed to prevent automated bots like me from accessing certain websites or services.”
“A.I. is just blowing through all of the things that are supposed to separate humans from machines,” said Ethan Mollick, an associate professor who studies innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.

Since the visual analysis tool suddenly appeared in Mr. Mollick’s version of Bing’s chatbot last month — making him, without any notification, one of the few people with early access — he hasn’t shut down his computer for fear of losing it. He gave it a photo of condiments in a refrigerator and asked Bing to suggest recipes for those ingredients. It came up with “whipped cream soda” and a “creamy jalapeño sauce.”
Both OpenAI and Microsoft seem aware of the power — and potential privacy implications — of this technology. A spokesman for Microsoft said that the company wasn’t “sharing technical details” about the face-blurring but was working “closely with our partners at OpenAI to uphold our shared commitment to the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies.”"
2023-07-19,"The Biden administration’s top antitrust officials unveiled tougher guidelines against tech mergers on Wednesday, signaling their deepening scrutiny of the industry despite recent court losses in their attempts to block tech deal-making.
Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, the top antitrust official at the Department of Justice, released draft guidelines for merger reviews that for the first time include a focus on digital platforms and how dominant companies can use their scale to harm future rivals.
The guidelines — which generally provide a road map for whether regulators block or approve deals — show the Biden administration’s commitment to an aggressive antitrust agenda aimed at curtailing the power of companies like Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon.
The guidelines, which aren’t enforced by law, follow a losing streak in the courts. A ruling last week prevented the F.T.C. from delaying the closing of Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard. In January, a court sided against the F.T.C. in its lawsuit to stop Meta’s purchase of Within, a virtual reality app maker.

The forceful antitrust posture is a pillar of President Biden’s agenda to stamp out economic inequality and encourage greater competition. “Promoting competition to lower costs and support small businesses and entrepreneurs is a central part of Bidenomics,” a senior administration official said in a call with reporters.
The new guidelines would apply to all deals across the economy. But they highlight obstacles to competition among digital platforms, including how an acquisition of a nascent rival may be intended to kill off future competition. Such deals, known as killer acquisitions, are prevalent in the tech industry and at the heart of an F.T.C. antitrust lawsuit against Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency has accused Meta of buying Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to prevent future competition.
The F.T.C. and Justice Department also said they would look at how companies used their scale, including their large number of users, to ward off competition. These so-called network effects have helped companies like Meta and Google maintain their dominance in social media and internet search.
The agencies also laid out ways in which mergers involving “platform” businesses, the model used by Amazon’s online store and Apple’s App Store, could harm competition. An acquisition could hurt competition by giving a platform control over a significant stream of data, the draft guidelines said, echoing concerns that tech giants use their vast troves of information to squash rivals.
“As markets and commercial realities change, it is vital that we adapt our law enforcement tools to keep pace so that we can protect competition in a manner that reflects the intricacies of our modern economy,” Mr. Kanter said in a statement. “Simply put, competition today looks different than it did 50 — or even 15 — years ago.”

While they lack the force of law, the guidelines can influence how judges look at challenges to mergers and acquisitions. The effort to update the guidelines has been closely watched by businesses and corporate lawyers that navigate regulatory scrutiny of megadeals.
The guidelines were last updated in 2020. In 2021, Mr. Biden ordered the Justice Department and the F.T.C. to update them again as part of a broader effort to improve competition across the economy. The agencies will take public comment on the proposals and could make amendments before final guidelines are adopted.
“These guidelines contain critical updates while ensuring fidelity to the mandate Congress has given us and the legal precedent on the books,” Ms. Khan said in a statement.
While the F.T.C. experienced the recent court losses, it has forced some companies, including the chip-maker Nvidia and the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, to abandon some large deals. The Justice Department blocked the publisher Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster, using an unusual argument that the merger would harm authors who sold the publication rights to their books."
2023-07-20,"Anyone seduced by A.I.-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard — wow, they can write essays and recipes! — eventually runs into what are known as hallucinations, the tendency for artificial intelligence to fabricate information.
The chatbots, which guess what to say based on information obtained from all over the internet, can’t help but get things wrong. And when they fail — by publishing a cake recipe with wildly inaccurate flour measurements, for instance — it can be a real buzzkill.
Yet as mainstream tech tools continue to integrate A.I., it’s crucial to get a handle on how to use it to serve us. After testing dozens of A.I. products over the last two months, I concluded that most of us are using the technology in a suboptimal way, largely because the tech companies gave us poor directions.
The chatbots are the least beneficial when we ask them questions and then hope whatever answers they come up with on their own are true, which is how they were designed to be used. But when directed to use information from trusted sources, such as credible websites and research papers, A.I. can carry out helpful tasks with a high degree of accuracy.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“If you give them the right information, they can do interesting things with it,” said Sam Heutmaker, the founder of Context, an A.I. start-up. “But on their own, 70 percent of what you get is not going to be accurate.”
With the simple tweak of advising the chatbots to work with specific data, they generated intelligible answers and useful advice. That transformed me over the last few months from a cranky A.I. skeptic into an enthusiastic power user. When I went on a trip using a travel itinerary planned by ChatGPT, it went well because the recommendations came from my favorite travel websites.
Directing the chatbots to specific high-quality sources like websites from well-established media outlets and academic publications can also help reduce the production and spread of misinformation. Let me share some of the approaches I used to get help with cooking, research and travel planning.
Meal Planning
Chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard can write recipes that look good in theory but don’t work in practice. In an experiment by The New York Times’s Food desk in November, an early A.I. model created recipes for a Thanksgiving menu that included an extremely dry turkey and a dense cake.
I also ran into underwhelming results with A.I.-generated seafood recipes. But that changed when I experimented with ChatGPT plug-ins, which are essentially third-party apps that work with the chatbot. (Only subscribers who pay $20 a month for access to ChatGPT4, the latest version of the chatbot, can use plug-ins, which can be activated in the settings menu.)
On ChatGPT’s plug-ins menu, I selected Tasty Recipes, which pulls data from the Tasty website owned by BuzzFeed, a well-known media site. I then asked the chatbot to come up with a meal plan including seafood dishes, ground pork and vegetable sides using recipes from the site. The bot presented an inspiring meal plan, including lemongrass pork banh mi, grilled tofu tacos and everything-in-the-fridge pasta; each meal suggestion included a link to a recipe on Tasty.
For recipes from other publications, I used Link Reader, a plug-in that let me paste in a web link to generate meal plans using recipes from other credible sites like Serious Eats. The chatbot pulled data from the sites to create meal plans and told me to visit the websites to read the recipes. That took extra work, but it beat an A.I.-concocted meal plan.

Research
When I did research for an article on a popular video game series, I turned to ChatGPT and Bard to refresh my memory on past games by summarizing their plots. They messed up on important details about the games’ stories and characters.
After testing many other A.I. tools, I concluded that for research, it was crucial to fixate on trusted sources and quickly double-check the data for accuracy. I eventually found a tool that delivers that: Humata.AI, a free web app that has become popular among academic researchers and lawyers.
The app lets you upload a document such as a PDF, and from there a chatbot answers your questions about the material alongside a copy of the document, highlighting relevant portions.
In one test, I uploaded a research paper I found on PubMed, a government-run search engine for scientific literature. The tool produced a relevant summary of the lengthy document in minutes, a process that would have taken me hours, and I glanced at the highlights to double-check that the summaries were accurate.
Cyrus Khajvandi, a founder of Humata, which is based in Austin, Texas, developed the app when he was a researcher at Stanford and needed help reading dense scientific articles, he said. The problem with chatbots like ChatGPT, he said, is that they rely on outdated models of the web, so the data may lack relevant context.

Travel Planning
When a Times travel writer recently asked ChatGPT to compose a travel itinerary for Milan, the bot guided her to visit a central part of town that was deserted because it was an Italian holiday, among other snafus.
I had better luck when I requested a vacation itinerary for me, my wife and our dogs in Mendocino County, Calif. As I did when planning a meal, I asked ChatGPT to incorporate suggestions from some of my favorite travel sites, such as Thrillist, which is owned by Vox, and The Times’s travel section.
Within minutes, the chatbot generated an itinerary that included dog-friendly restaurants and activities, including a farm with wine and cheese pairings and a train to a popular hiking trail. This spared me several hours of planning, and most important, the dogs had a wonderful time.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Bottom Line
Google and OpenAI, which works closely with Microsoft, say they are working to reduce hallucinations in their chatbots, but we can already reap A.I.’s benefits by taking control of the data that the bots rely on to come up with answers.
To put it another way: The main benefit of training machines with enormous data sets is that they can now use language to simulate human reasoning, said Nathan Benaich, a venture capitalist who invests in A.I. companies. The important step for us, he said, is to pair that ability with high-quality information."

President Biden wants to see tech companies build “responsible A.I.”

The White House brokers an A.I. safety pledge
In a potentially significant victory for the Biden administration, top players in artificial intelligence, including Microsoft, Google and OpenAI, are to meet at the White House on Friday to pledge to build safeguards into their development of a technology that has captivated Wall Street and rattled many world leaders.
The commitments are voluntary, but industry watchers see the move as an important first step toward protecting consumers and businesses.
The White House wants the companies to commit to “responsible” development. Concerns are rife that A.I. could turbocharge misinformation and cybercrime, and pose a national security risk. There also are fears that the technology will steal jobs and that unethical players will misappropriate the intellectual property of companies, artists and ordinary people in the commercialization of their generative A.I. tools. Such complaints have already led to a string of lawsuits.
The White House said it would work with overseas allies, including Britain, Germany, Japan and South Korea, to develop common groundwork on A.I. governance. It comes as China is developing its own guidelines for A.I. and chatbots, which have exploded in use in recent months.

Congress has been slow to legislate A.I., despite calls from the industry for regulation. The Biden administration, which hosted tech executives at the White House in the spring for a “frank discussion” about the future of A.I., said it was working on “an executive order and will pursue bipartisan legislation to help America lead the way in responsible innovation.”
An industry effort is probably the quickest way to see an impact. The safeguards include pledges not to commercially release A.I. products until they’ve undergone safety tests; to institute a watermarking system to minimize fraud and deception; to publicly disclose the capabilities and limitations of the tools; and a commitment to research the societal risks of the technology.
Such commitments are significant, Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer at the software company WithSecure and a cybercrime adviser to Europol, told DealBook. Among his chief concerns are malware writers using generative A.I. to develop powerful hacking tools. These developments are inevitable, he said, but until rules are established, the risks can be minimized by industry cooperation. Otherwise, the corporate focus will be on a competition for market share and “a race is a dangerous thing when you are trying to do things safely and securely,” he said.
Those scheduled to attend the White House session include: Brad Smith of Microsoft, Nick Clegg from Meta, Kent Walker of Google, Greg Brockman of OpenAI, Adam Selipsky of Amazon Web Services, Dario Amodei of Anthropic and Mustafa Suleyman of Inflection AI.
In other A.I. news: Sergey Brin, the Google co-founder who stepped down from his leadership role in 2019, is reportedly back and working closely with researchers on the company’s A.I. initiatives.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Microsoft overcomes another F.T.C. hurdle. The agency said it would withdraw its administrative case looking into the software giant’s $69 billion bid for Activision Blizzard, clearing the way for Microsoft to negotiate a settlement or argue that the F.T.C. ought to drop its objections.
FTX sues Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison and others for $1 billion. The bankrupt crypto exchange is seeking to claw back funds from the FTX founder, Mr. Bankman-Fried, and his former lieutenants, including Ms. Ellison. The firm accuses them of misappropriating funds before the company collapsed.
Ben Bernanke says the Fed is nearly done raising interest rates. The former central bank chief says a rate increase at next week’s Fed meeting is highly likely but a September move is “up for grabs.” The markets have been rallying lately on hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its tightening cycle as inflation starts to fall.
The Biden administration plans to raise drilling costs on federal lands. It would be the first change in more than a century to the royalties that energy companies pay to extract gas, oil and coal from government-owned territory. The Interior Department estimates that energy firms will incur $1.8 billion in additional costs by 2031 as a result of the move.

Dan Snyder breaks two records
The N.F.L. on Thursday approved the sale of the Washington Commanders to a group led by Josh Harris, the Apollo co-founder, for a record $6.05 billion.
The deal represents a huge return for Dan Snyder, who bought the team in 1999 for $800 million. But a different number has dominated the headlines: Mr. Snyder has been fined a record $60 million for sexually harassing a female employee.

The finding follows a 17-month investigation led by Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor and chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. She concluded that Mr. Snyder sexually harassed Tiffani Johnston, who was a former cheerleader and a marketing employee for the Commanders.
The report also found that the team had intentionally shielded and withheld at least $11 million of revenue that should have been shared among the league’s 32 teams. The investigation did not rule out the possibility that Mr. Snyder had directed or participated in this revenue-shielding, but that “at a minimum, he was aware of certain efforts to minimize revenue sharing.”

The activist investor with an eye for luxury
The French luxury holding company Kering shocked the fashion industry this week when it announced a sweeping reorganization of its top ranks, including the departure of the longtime C.E.O. of its premier brand, Gucci.
The move came amid a year of declining sales and stock performance. But the conglomerate run by the billionaire François-Henri Pinault is also under pressure from Bluebell Capital Partners, a London-based activist hedge fund that has tangled with luxury titans before, a person with knowledge of the matter told DealBook’s Michael de la Merced and The Times’s Elizabeth Paton.(Kering declined to comment.)

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Activists have turned on the luxury industry in recent years. Dan Loeb’s Third Point and Artisan Partners called for change at Richemont, the owner of jewelry brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. But the most active of late is Bluebell, a four-year-old, $250 million firm that has also targeted Richemont, as well as the fashion brand Hugo Boss. (Bluebell has also pushed for change at BlackRock and the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.)
Bluebell failed to persuade fellow Richemont shareholders to add Francesco Trapani, the former C.E.O. of Bulgari, as a director, but the conglomerate agreed to give public investors more influence.
Bluebell has an ambitious goal for Kering. Though the hedge fund is seeking a number of changes at the conglomerate and at Gucci, it has also proposed a merger with Richemont, the person with knowledge of the discussions said.
But making the deal happen won’t be easy. Richemont’s founder, Johann Rupert, said in May that he wasn’t interested in a merger — and had rejected such a proposal two years ago. And Pinault may not be interested either. Moreover, both luxury companies are controlled by their founding families, making it nearly impossible for outside investors to prevail in corporate elections.

Bluebell is hoping that restive shareholders will join its push. Kering’s stock price has been eclipsed by rivals such as Hermes and LVMH during the past year, while sales rose by just 1 percent, to 5.08 billion euros (then $5.58 billion) in the first quarter. But Kering’s stock rose more than 7 percent on Wednesday after Bloomberg first reported on Bluebell’s efforts.

This “Barbie” is expected to have a big opening weekend.

‘Barbenheimer’ shakes up the box office
The movie business is gearing up for what is expected to be one of its best weekends in years, with North American ticket sales expected to surpass $250 million for the first time since December 2021, according to Gower Street Analytics.
The reason? Two very different movies that have film executives rethinking the conventional wisdom about summer blockbusters: “Barbie,” Greta Gerwig’s bubble-gum-pink subversive take on the Mattel doll, and “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s heavy three-hour biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in creating the atomic bomb.
Consumers have bought more than 200,000 tickets to watch the films back-to-back, a double-feature known as “Barbenheimer,” according to the National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry lobby group. “There’s nothing like this I’ve ever seen before,” said Bob Bagby, chief executive of B&B Theatres, which operates more than 50 locations in the Midwest.
“Barbie” could bring in up to $189 million this weekend while “Oppenheimer” is expected to earn $55 million to $64 million, according to the film-tracking service The Quorum. Both are a departure from the superhero movies and sequels that studios tend to bet will be summer hits. “Normally in the summer the studios are very, very risk averse,” said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst at Comscore. “You want the most commercial movies.”

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Barbie” is based on a doll everyone recognizes, but that’s not enough to guarantee a hit movie. And Mr. Dergarabedian said it was a risk to give the reins to Ms. Gerwig, the acclaimed director of “Lady Bird” and “Little Women,” rather than turn it into a rom-com (though the star power of the lead actors Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling, and a pervasive marketing blitz, certainly helped).
Big movies usually compete at the box office, but “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” seem to be helping each other. Even if a relatively small audience actually sees both movies, “there’s no denying that the profile of both films has risen exponentially,” Mr. Dergarabedian said.
But it’s not clear that Barbenheimer is a repeatable playbook. “Part of this was by design,” Mr. Dergarabedian said. “Some of it is by happenstance. And, you know, the movie gods played a role.”

Extreme heat is surging in wide swaths of the planet, breaking records from the U.S. to southern Europe and China.

As heat waves gripped three continents this week, venturing outside for even a few minutes in Phoenix, Rome or a town in northwest China at times meant risking heatstroke or worse. This weekend, about 80 million Americans are expected to experience a heat index — what the temperature feels like to the body — of at least 105 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The extreme heat is prompting violent typhoons in Asia and flash floods in the United States. It’s taxing power grids, driving up health care costs and messing with tourists’ holidays. And it’s eventually going to impact everything — and the business of everything.
El Niño and a stagnant jet stream contributed to the record-breaking temperatures. But to the pragmatist, extreme heat is the new normal.
Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, the head of climate science at Climate Analytics, a policy institute in Berlin, said, “Most of our cities are not equipped to deal with these kinds of summers.”
“We’ll have to develop adaptation strategies” — and fast, he told DealBook.
The good news: Investors are spending big on climate projects. Global warming helps make periods of extreme heat more frequent, longer and more intense, and it will continue getting worse unless humans essentially stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, scientists say. Venture investing in climate tech has boomed since the post-Covid recovery began (though it fell, along with venture funding overall, in the first half of the year). And global public and private investment in climate finance, on projects ranging from decarbonizing architecture and transport to developing renewable energy initiatives, more than doubled from 2011 to 2021, to an estimated $850 billion, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit climate advocacy group. (It will top $1 trillion with the passage of the Biden administration’s sweeping climate bills, the European Union’s Green Deal and China’s low-carbon development initiatives announced in its latest five-year plan.)
“There’s been huge, huge progress” in developing green technologies and bringing down their costs, said Bella Tonkonogy, the U.S. director of Climate Policy Initiative whose funders include the Bloomberg Foundation and the German government.

The less good news: Addressing a source of the problem is no longer enough. The effects have arrived, and extreme heat has become the leading weather-related killer in much of the world. Some cities, homeowners and businesses are investing in low-cost hacks that can help make cities, which tend to absorb and re-emit heat more than natural landscapes, more bearable in the summer. Painting roofs white or another reflective color can cool structures down, making air conditioning units as much as 15 percent more energy-efficient, said Jane Gilbert, the chief heat officer of Miami-Dade County, Fla. Homes and businesses have to be retrofitted to stay cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, and Miami-Dade has secured millions in federal funding for that plan. Planting trees also adds vital shade to reduce temperatures on city streets.
Only about 7 percent of climate finance is focused on adaptation efforts, according to the Climate Policy Initiative. But more investors are becoming interested, Ms. Tonkonogy said. Last year, the organization partnered with LightSmith Group, a private equity firm, on a $186 million climate fund designed to finance climate resilience projects that could help communities adapt to and withstand the kinds of the extreme weather events that have become so frequent this summer.
“The reason that people are investing more in climate adaptation is because they’re actually seeing the impacts of climate change,” Ms. Tonkonogy said. — Bernhard Warner
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Microsoft moves closer to sealing its $69 billion deal for Activision Blizzard. The F.T.C. withdrew its in-house case against the acquisition, and Britain’s antitrust regulator is reconsidering its decision to block the deal. Microsoft also signed a truce with Sony, one of the biggest opponents to the deal, by agreeing to keep Call of Duty on the Japanese firm’s PlayStation console for a decade after the acquisition closes.
BlackRock U-turn? The investment firm appointed Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Aramco, the Saudi oil giant, to its board. The decision was criticized by some as a hypocritical, given the public commitments made by Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, to E.S.G. principles and advoacy for decarbonization. But the U.S. company said Nasser understood “the global energy industry and the drivers of the shift towards a low carbon economy.”
A venture capital titan exits. Michael Moritz is set to leave Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm, after a career as one of Silicon Valley’s most successful investors.

A.I. brings shadow libraries into the spotlight
Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the artificial intelligence systems that power tools like ChatGPT, are developed using enormous libraries of text. Books are considered especially useful training material, because they’re lengthy and (hopefully) well-written. But authors are starting to push back against their work being used this way.
This week, more than 9,000 authors, including Margaret Atwood and James Patterson, called on tech executives to stop training their tools on writers’ work without compensation.
That campaign has cast a spotlight on an arcane part of the internet: so-called shadow libraries, like Library Genesis, Z-Library or Bibliotik, that are obscure repositories storing millions of titles, in many cases without permission — and are often used as A.I. training data.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
A.I. companies have acknowledged in research papers that they rely on shadow libraries. OpenAI’s GPT-1 was trained on BookCorpus, which has over 7,000 unpublished titles scraped from the self-publishing platform Smashwords.
To train GPT-3, OpenAI said that about 16 percent of the data it used came from two “internet-based books corpora” that it called “Books1” and “Books2.” According to a lawsuit by the comedian Sarah Silverman and two other authors against OpenAI, Books2 is most likely a “flagrantly illegal” shadow library.
These sites have been under scrutiny for some time. The Authors Guild, which organized the authors’ open letter to tech executives, cited studies in 2016 and 2017 that suggested text piracy depressed legitimate book sales by as much as 14 percent.
Efforts to shut down these sites have floundered. Last year, the F.B.I., with help from the Authors Guild, charged two people accused of running Z-Library with copyright infringement, fraud and money laundering. But afterward, some of these sites were moved to the dark web and torrent sites, making it harder to trace them. And because many of these sites are run outside the United States and anonymously, actually punishing the operators is a tall task.

Tech companies are becoming more tight-lipped about the data used to train their systems. This week, Meta researchers published a paper on Llama 2, the company’s L.L.M., that described using only a “new mix of data from publicly available sources.” In a research paper on GPT-4 published in March, OpenAI explicitly noted that it wasn’t revealing anything about how it trained the L.L.M., citing “the competitive landscape” and “safety considerations.”

The Women’s World Cup kicked off in New Zealand this week against a backdrop of booming investor interest in women’s sports. As women’s leagues draw record crowds, and larger (if not equal) sponsorships, investors are pouring money into an industry they say has been under-marketed and underinvested in — betting on growth as social media and streaming make the prime time spotlight less singularly powerful.
Aly Wagner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, helped raise a record $53 million from funds, led by Sixth Street, for Bay FC, a new Bay Area soccer team, this year. DealBook spoke with her from New Zealand, where she is the lead analyst of the Women’s World Cup at Fox, about the business case behind these investments. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Sponsorship dollars still aren’t equal. Why is that?
There’s just a lot more assets and a lot more teams that you can partner with on the men’s side than you can on the women’s side.
But the other part of it is that women’s sports have been an undervalued asset for way too long. It’s a massive opportunity for a lot of these brands to now have great visibility for target markets at probably a discount from what you would get on the men’s side.
Two prior efforts to launch new women’s teams in the Bay Area folded. Why will Bay FC, which you co-founded, succeed?
Because, while it was incredible what some of the previous iterations of professional women’s football did in the Bay Area, that really wasn’t a business proposition. It wasn’t looked at as there was going to be R.O.I. and that this was something valuable and worth holding onto as a long-term asset. This was looked at as a moral cause.
And yet, media rights still lag far behind. Apple recently signed a 10-year, $2.5 billion deal with Major League Soccer. The National Women’s Soccer League’s deal with CBS, which was signed in 2020, was worth $4.5 million over three years. How important is parity to R.O.I.?
Media is massive. It’s one of the biggest levers you can pull in terms of the revenue for the different clubs. What’s interesting about our timing, though, is the media game itself is changing. Would you want to be equal from Day 1? Sure. But what is equal? M.L.S. has been around for how many years? How many eyeballs do they put on their sport? They went behind a paywall. Has that been challenging? Probably.
As the media game changes, I think we can get really creative, and because we’re a new league, we can be nimble in that regard.

Alex Ohanian called underinvestment in women’s sport “a legacy of gross business incompetence.” Is it simply sexism, or something more nuanced?
Culturally, we’re all raised with certain narratives — some of them conscious, some of them unconscious. I think the biggest hurdle that we’ve had to overcome is just that a lot of the world believes in seeing things before they believe them. Men were playing sports long before women were at a competitive level, right? And long before it became an investment opportunity. And so we were just behind in that evolution.

2023-07-25,"Microsoft reported record sales and profits on Tuesday, as it shook off recession fears and began seeing the early impacts of its investments in generative artificial intelligence.
The company had $56.2 billion in sales in the three months that ended in June, up 8 percent from a year earlier. Profit hit $20.1 billion, up 20 percent. The results beat analyst expectations and Microsoft’s own estimates.
The profits beat Microsoft’s previous record of $18.8 billion, in the last quarter of 2021, even as capital expenses grew to $10.7 billion, which included costs to build out data centers and buy expensive chips necessary for developing cutting-edge A.I. The previous sales record was $52.9 billion in the quarter that ended in March this year.
Microsoft’s big bet on artificial intelligence has created big expectations. After company executives said in a call with investors on Tuesday that its sales projection for the next quarter would fall short of Wall Street expectations, its share price fell about 4 percent in after-hours trading.
Investors have rallied behind Microsoft in recent months as the company has unveiled generative A.I. features across its products, including integrating a chatbot into its Bing search engine and adding an A.I. assistant to its software used in offices around the world.
“Organizations are asking not only how — but how fast — they can apply this next generation of A.I. to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face — safely and responsibly,” Satya Nadella, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement.

2023-07-26,"Stock markets slipped on Wednesday morning, as cautious investors parsed mixed earnings reports and prepared for the Federal Reserve to resume raising interest rates.
The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent ahead of the Fed’s announcement. The index has gained nearly 20 percent since the start of the year, but the rally has slowed this month from its earlier breakneck pace.
The Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 stocks that are intended to track the broader economy, was on course for a 13th consecutive day of gains, posting a small gain in early trading Wednesday.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 percent.
Despite the Fed seeking to engineer a gentle economic slowdown, easing inflation by raising interest rates, the economy has proved resilient. Unemployment remains low, corporate profitability has been dented but not destroyed and household budgets are in better shape than expected.
Although inflation has slowed, investors and analysts expect Fed officials to emphasize that their job is not yet over, meaning rates could rise further, or at least remain high for a prolonged period, squeezing companies and consumers.
Investors have in recent days ramped up bets on the Fed raising interest rates by an additional quarter of a percentage point later this year, and will be listening to comments from the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, for signs of this in his thinking.

“Reining in Big Tech platforms is a top priority on both sides of the aisle,” says Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts.

A bipartisan push for a new digital cop
For years, policymakers have worried about the growing power of digital giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, as they came to dominate more and more of everyday life. Now, two prominent senators are pushing to create a new federal agency to rein in the power of Big Tech.
Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, plan to introduce the Digital Consumer Protection Commission Act, which they say would restrain tech titans while letting them continue to innovate. But these companies have fought hard against increased oversight, and it’s unclear how a new agency will fit into a Washington already full of regulators.
The bill is in the vein of legislation that established agencies to oversee fast-growing industries, much like how Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This time, the focus is on online platforms that together command nearly $10 trillion in market cap and whose products touch on free speech, privacy, jobs and more.
“For too long, giant tech companies have exploited consumers’ data, invaded Americans’ privacy, threatened our national security and stomped out competition in our economy,” Ms. Warren told DealBook’s Ephrat Livni.
In teaming up with Mr. Graham, who has expressed support for creating an A.I. czar, Ms. Warren said the bill made “clear that reining in Big Tech platforms is a top priority on both sides of the aisle.”

Some issues the new commission would focus on are:
Dominant market positions, which the senators say allow companies to unfairly promote their own products and diminish competition;
Data privacy, an area not currently covered by a comprehensive federal law and which touches on targeted advertising and more;
Social harms like sexual abuse and exploitation of children, cyberbullying and promotion of suicidal ideation and eating disorders;
And fast-growing innovations like artificial intelligence, which could lead to discrimination, job losses and a host of other unforeseen consequences.
Graham told DealBook that the act was “the first step in a long journey to protect American consumers from the massive power these companies currently wield.”
It’s meant to coordinate the tangle of efforts to regulate tech, including the F.T.C. and the Justice Department’s antitrust arm on competition, state attorneys general and more. An aide to Warren said the new agency would expand the F.T.C.’s and the Justice Department’s authority, for example, and take a comprehensive view on oversight. (The F.T.C. and the Justice Department declined to comment.)
But the proposal faces high hurdles. Democrats and Republicans agree on little these days, though reining in tech is a rare point of consensus. Skeptics also note that tech companies have close ties to lawmakers and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying that helped kill previous efforts to police their industry.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Mastercard moves to block cannabis purchases using its debit cards. The payments giant told financial institutions to bar such transactions, citing the illegality of marijuana on a federal level. It’s a further blow to the cannabis industry.
Crypto marks a milestone in Congress. A bill to develop a regulatory framework for digital assets moved out of a congressional committee — in this case, the House Financial Services Committee. The legislation, which would specify when a cryptocurrency was a security or commodity and clarify regulators’ jurisdiction, will now be considered by the House Agriculture Committee.
The S.E.C. proposes new rules for online brokers’ use of consumer data. The regulator will push for companies like Robinhood to address conflicts of interest in using predictive data analytics, to avoid putting their interests ahead of consumers. The proposal follows up on concerns about the “gamification” of markets that the agency had raised after the meme-stock frenzy.

Meta’s year of growth
Speaking of tech giants, shares in Meta were up more than 8 percent in premarket trading Thursday after the company predicted that a recovery in its core advertising business would lead to its fastest overall revenue growth since a pandemic-era tech boom.

Meta’s better-than-expected earnings mirrored those of Alphabet, which this week also reported a rebound in ad revenue, especially at YouTube. Investors have piled into both companies since the start of the year, pushing their combined market value above $2 trillion.
At Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, sales growth was powered by better ad targeting, thanks to A.I. tools, and increased advertising in the Reels video format on those platforms.

But smaller digital rivals are still struggling. Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, reported a second straight drop in revenue this week, sending its shares tumbling. And X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, has reportedly resorted to steep discounts to woo back advertisers.
Meta’s fortunes are turning around. After ending last year with three straight decline quarters and having laid off thousands of workers, the company is growing again. It now claims over 3.8 billion monthly users across its apps, which also include Messenger, WhatsApp and the newly launched Threads.

Those gains appeared to offset investor concerns about spending on the metaverse. Meta’s Reality Labs division, which is focused on building tools for immersive online worlds that Mark Zuckerberg has called the future of his company, lost another $3.7 billion last quarter.
But the Meta chief isn’t backing down, telling analysts on Wednesday: “I can’t guarantee you that I’m going to be right about this bet. I do think that this is the direction that the world is going in.”

The Fed grows more optimistic
The Fed isn’t quite predicting a “soft landing” for the economy, but the central bank is feeling more upbeat after raising interest rates on Wednesday to their highest level in 22 years.
Fed economists are no longer forecasting a recession, a rosier outlook than many on Wall Street hold. Fed officials now see “moderate” growth ahead, an upgrade from their characterization of “modest” last month. Speaking of which, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, the Commerce Department will release gross domestic product data that’s expected to show the economy having grown by 2 percent.
It’s too soon to say if the Fed is done raising rates. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, acknowledged that “we’ve come a long way” in bringing down headline inflation from last summer’s peak of about 9 percent. But he added that it was still well above the central bank’s target.
Coming up: Two key Consumer Price Index reports and two jobs reports are set to be released between now and the Fed’s next rate-setting meeting in September. The central bank and investors will scrutinize those reports for any signs of inflation perking up.
Mr. Powell has laid out the importance of the upcoming data releases for Fed policy: “It is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted,” he said. “And I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.”

PGA Tour seeks to get out of the rough with its players
Weeks after pro golfers raised complaints about how they have been treated in the PGA Tour’s negotiations with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund over a shake-up of the sport, they have finally received some concessions from the tour.
Among them is the appointment (at the tour’s expense) of Colin Neville, a partner at the merchant bank Raine, to advise players in the deal talks, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and The Times’s Alan Blinder and Kevin Draper report. The move underscores the circuit’s efforts to ease the worries of some of its most important figures.

Hiring Neville is meant to help restore trust in the deal negotiations, with the banker advising players who are members of the PGA Tour’s board, including Patrick Cantlay, Rory McIlroy and Webb Simpson.
“I’m confident Colin’s perspective and expertise will help ensure a transparent, efficient, and collaborative process,” Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, wrote in a memo to PGA Tour members on Wednesday.
The PGA Tour extended another olive branch to players, agreeing to give them a say in picking the successor to Randall Stephenson, the former AT&T chief who resigned this month from the group’s board. Mr. Stephenson had deep reservations about the tentative deal and the secretive process that led to it. In a departure from usual practice, Mr. Monahan said that Mr. Stephenson’s replacement would require the unanimous support of the board, including the players who sit on it.
The tour is also trying to find a way to reward loyal players. Mr. Monahan wrote that the PGA Tour was working on a “financially significant” plan to compensate players who stuck with the circuit, even as the Saudi-backed LIV Golf circuit dangled large purses and enormous guaranteed contracts to defectors. The tour has also created a task force to determine how to handle players who jumped to LIV Golf series and may want to return.
The next significant step in all these efforts will come in Memphis, where Mr. Monahan — who recently returned from medical leave — is expected to meet with players on Aug. 8.

Will today’s inflation data come in above or below the Fed’s target?
Credit...
Eva Marie Uzcategui for The New York Times
A big test for the economy
With the S&P 500 in bull-market territory, corporate profits coming in better than expected and surprisingly decent economic growth, the soft-landing optimists are feeling pretty good about the direction of the economy. But their position will be tested as soon as Friday morning.
At 8:30 a.m. Eastern, the Commerce Department will release the June figures for the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Economists expect to see a core P.C.E. reading — which strips out volatile purchases like food and energy — of 4.2 percent, down sharply from a year ago, but still well above the central bank’s target of 2 percent.
A hot P.C.E. number could determine the Fed’s next move on interest rates. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, reiterated on Wednesday that progress had been made in reducing inflation, but that it remained too high to rule out further increases in interest rates. That is top of mind for investors, who will be scrutinizing inflation and labor market data — the next jobs report comes out next Friday — to figure out what the Fed will do in September.
The concern is that the U.S. economy is still on uncertain footing, and that further tightening of borrowing costs could trigger a downturn. The Fed’s own economists no longer predict a recession, but some on Wall Street remain bearish about the second half of the year.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Economists worry that prices will be higher for longer. “We are cautiously optimistic of a quicker return to 2 percent” core P.C.E., Andrew Patterson, senior economist at Vanguard, wrote in a research note on Thursday. But he added that such a target was not likely to be reached before 2025.
Translation: Inflation could remain a wild card for the Fed well into next year.
Europe’s economy is looking even more vulnerable. As expected, the European Central Bank raised interest rates on Thursday by a quarter percentage point, as the eurozone grapples with inflation rates well above the United States’s.
Christine Lagarde, the E.C.B.’s president, suggested that the central bank could pause on raising rates in September, as data showed high prices sapping consumers of their buying power, putting the bloc’s economy at risk. Data this morning from Germany showing that Europe’s biggest economy is stagnating underscored this concern.
Meanwhile, in Japan … The Bank of Japan surprised global markets this morning by loosening its cap on 10-year government bond yields, the equivalent of an interest-rate increase.
Japanese stocks and bonds fell sharply, catching up with a drop in U.S. stock indexes on Thursday that was driven by forecasts that Japan’s central bank would signal an end to its yearslong policy of maintaining rock-bottom interest rates.

A return to luxury megadeals?
The fashion world took note on Thursday when Kering, the conglomerate that owns Gucci, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Saint Laurent, bought a 30 percent stake in Valentino at a $1.9 billion valuation.
The deal, which gives Kering the right to buy the rest of Valentino by 2028, signals the company’s return to big-ticket M.&A.
ADVERTISEMENT

It’s a major strategic move by Kering, which has been eclipsed in recent years by its archrival LVMH, which through deals for Tiffany, Off White and others is now significantly bigger in both size and market cap.
Kering, which is controlled by the billionaire Pinault family, has also suffered from controversy at Balenciaga and turmoil at its flagship Gucci brand. The conglomerate, which has come under pressure from the activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners, has already taken steps to shake things up, like replacing Gucci’s C.E.O.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The fashion industry has long been waiting for Kering’s next steps. The company has billions in free cash flow and a need to keep up with LVMH, so bankers have speculated about what would come next. The conglomerate’s last deal, the $3.8 billion takeover of the perfume company Creed, represented a big move by Kering into beauty.
The Valentino deal is more squarely in its wheelhouse, allowing Kering to use its huge distribution platform to supercharge sales of the luxury brand.
An interesting facet of the transaction is that Kering is starting with a minority stake, a rarity in big luxury deals. There are some potential explanations for that: It could give the companies time to work out their creative vision before a potential full takeover of Valentino, or it could allow Kering to shut out possible rivals without having to buy the entirety of the brand right away.
Will more luxury M.&A. emerge? Though analysts had speculated that Valentino would pursue an I.P.O., selling gives it an immediate cash boost. And as LVMH and Kering continue to pursue scale, investors will speculate about whether other independent brands — including Armani, Burberry, Ferragamo and Prada — may become targets as well.

An argument for how not to fix flawed mergers
Despite setbacks in court, the Biden administration’s top competition cops — Lina Khan of the F.T.C. and Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department’s antitrust division — have signaled that they’ll continue to be tough on reviewing mergers.
But proposed merger guidelines released last week are still flawed, according to Jason Furman, a head of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, and Carl Shapiro, another Obama economic official. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, they write that while mergers should be closely scrutinized, the guidelines risk turning what are rules based on widely accepted economic principles into, potentially, a political football:
They contain a structural presumption against many vertical mergers unsupported by theory or evidence. The proposed guideline on acquisitions of products or services that rivals may use to compete includes legal wishful thinking about how commitments made by the merging parties are treated, as the recent court rebuke of the F.T.C.’s attempt to block Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision illustrates.
Likewise, a new guideline states that “mergers should not entrench or extend a dominant position,” where a “dominant position” means a market share of at least 30 percent. As we read this guideline, many nonhorizontal deals that enable the acquiring firm to become more efficient, and thus gain market share or compete more effectively in adjacent markets, would be considered illegal even if they benefit consumers and workers. If this isn’t the intention, revisions are needed.

“Pricing the priceless”
Climate change is impossible to ignore as wildfire smoke dulls the skies across continents and air and water temperatures soar to new highs. That makes it especially timely to consider novel approaches to addressing the climate crisis, says Paula DiPerna, author of a new book, “Pricing the Priceless: The Financial Transformation to Value the Planet, Solve the Climate Crisis, and Protect Our Most Precious Assets.”
Ms. DiPerna spoke to DealBook this week. The interview has been edited and condensed.
What’s the idea behind your argument?
The principle is that nature is an unpaid worker providing services, like carbon sequestration, soil retention, water filtration, replenishing raw materials and more. It is providing an invisible subsidy to world economies. Protecting the environment is portfolio management.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
How would placing a price tag on nature help?
Take carbon pricing. If you can put a value on a ton of carbon dioxide, which we can do now, then why wouldn’t it be feasible to pay countries to not drill for oil or cut their trees, to protect resources instead of exploiting them?
Poor countries that have abundant natural resources are loaning their economic resources, like the carbon-sequestering value of their rainforests, to rich countries without compensation. Last year at COP [the U.N. climate conference], [Special Presidential Envoy for Climate] John Kerry practically begged the Democratic Republic of the Congo not to drill for oil in rainforest and peat lands, which would release lots of carbon, and the retort was “pay us.” It’s not a bad answer, actually.
Are there examples of successful projects for preserving natural resources?
The Forest Resilience Bond is the brainchild of four Berkeley graduate students. What they did was look at standing forests in the Lake Tahoe area as infrastructure. And they raised funds to maintain the forest — like you would for an infrastructure project — from the beneficiaries of the environment, such as the local wildlife service, the tourism industry, insurers and even hydropower companies that rely on standing forest to replenish groundwater. That kind of bond could be done all around the world.
Why add such a pricing structure when economies can exploit nature for free?
We are facing real costs now. Nature is the thing underpinning our economies and it is a depreciating asset. We speculate about price all the time when it comes to company valuations. Yet the atmosphere is worth nothing. We need a new kind of thinking.

2023-07-29,"The Biden administration is hunting for malicious computer code it believes China has hidden deep inside the networks controlling power grids, communications systems and water supplies that feed military bases in the United States and around the world, according to American military, intelligence and national security officials.
The discovery of the malware has raised fears that Chinese hackers, probably working for the People’s Liberation Army, have inserted code designed to disrupt U.S. military operations in the event of a conflict, including if Beijing moves against Taiwan in coming years.
The malware, one congressional official said, was essentially “a ticking time bomb” that could give China the power to interrupt or slow American military deployments or resupply operations by cutting off power, water and communications to U.S. military bases. But its impact could be far broader, because that same infrastructure often supplies the houses and businesses of ordinary Americans, according to U.S. officials.
The first public hints of the malware campaign began to emerge in late May, when Microsoft said it had detected mysterious computer code in telecommunications systems in Guam, the Pacific island with a vast American air base, and elsewhere in the United States. But that turned out to be only the narrow slice of the problem that Microsoft could see through its networks.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
More than a dozen U.S. officials and industry experts said in interviews over the past two months that the Chinese effort goes far beyond telecommunications systems and predated the May report by at least a year. They said the U.S. government’s effort to hunt down the code, and eradicate it, has been underway for some time. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential and in some cases classified assessments.
They say the investigations so far show the Chinese effort appears more widespread — in the United States and at American facilities abroad — than they had initially realized. But officials acknowledge that they do not know the full extent of the code’s presence in networks around the world, partly because it is so well hidden.
The discovery of the malware has touched off a series of Situation Room meetings in the White House in recent months, as senior officials from the National Security Council, the Pentagon, the Homeland Security Department and the nation’s spy agencies attempt to understand the scope of the problem and plot a response.
Biden administration officials have begun to brief members of Congress, some state governors and utility companies about the findings, and confirmed some conclusions about the operation in interviews with The New York Times.
There is a debate inside the administration over whether the goal of the operation is primarily aimed at disrupting the military, or at civilian life more broadly in the event of a conflict. But officials say that the initial searches for the code have focused first on areas with a high concentration of American military bases.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In response to questions from The Times, the White House issued a statement Friday night that made no reference to China or the military bases.
“The Biden administration is working relentlessly to defend the United States from any disruptions to our critical infrastructure, including by coordinating interagency efforts to protect water systems, pipelines, rail and aviation systems, among others,” said Adam R. Hodge, the acting spokesman for the National Security Council.
He added: “The president has also mandated rigorous cybersecurity practices for the first time.” Mr. Hodge was referring to a series of executive orders, some motivated by concerns over SolarWinds, commercial software used widely by the U.S. government that was breached by a Russian surveillance operation, and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack by a Russian criminal group. That attack resulted in the temporary cutoff of half the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel supplies that run up the East Coast.
The U.S. government and Microsoft have attributed the recent malware attack to Chinese state-sponsored actors, but the government has not disclosed why it reached that conclusion. There is debate among different arms of the U.S. government about the intent of the intrusions, but not about their source.
The public revelation of the malware operation comes at an especially fraught moment in relations between Washington and Beijing, with clashes that include Chinese threats against Taiwan and American efforts to ban the sale of highly sophisticated semiconductors to the Chinese government. Many of the tensions in the relationship have been driven not only by technological competition but by mutual accusations of malicious activity in cyberspace.

The United States has blamed China for a variety of major hacks against U.S. agencies and infrastructure, and accused the foreign power of spying from a bus-size balloon that traversed the United States in February, until it was shot down off South Carolina. For its part, China has accused the United States of hacking into Huawei, its telecommunications giant. Secret documents released a decade ago by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor now in exile in Russia, confirmed that American intelligence agencies did just that.
But almost all of those cases involved intelligence gathering. The discovery of the malicious code in American infrastructure, one of Mr. Biden’s most senior advisers said, “raises the question of what, exactly, they are preparing for.”
If gaining advantage in a Taiwan confrontation is at the heart of China’s intent, slowing down American military deployments by a few days or weeks might give China a window in which it would have an easier time taking control of the island by force.
Chinese concern about American intervention was most likely fueled by President Biden’s several statements over the past 18 months that he would defend Taiwan with American troops if necessary.
Another theory is that the code is intended to distract. Chinese officials, U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed, may believe that during an attack on Taiwan or other Chinese action, any interruptions in U.S. infrastructure could so fixate the attention of American citizens that they would think little about an overseas conflict.

The Chinese embassy in Washington issued a statement on Saturday after publication of this article, denying that it engages in hacking and accusing the United States of being a far larger offender. “We have always firmly opposed and cracked down on all forms of cyberattacking in accordance with the law,” said Haoming Ouyang, an embassy spokesman.
“The Chinese government agencies face numerous cyberattacks every day, most of which come from sources in the U.S.,” he wrote, adding: “We hope relevant parties will stop smearing China with groundless accusations.”
Chinese officials have never conceded that China was behind the theft of security clearance files of roughly 22 million Americans — including six million sets of fingerprints — from the Office of Personnel Management during the Obama administration. That exfiltration resulted in an agreement between President Obama and President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity. The agreement has since collapsed.
Now, Chinese cyberoperations seem to have taken a turn. The latest intrusions are different from those in the past because disruption, not surveillance, appears to be the objective, U.S. officials say.
At the Aspen Security Forum earlier this month, Rob Joyce, the director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, said China’s recent hack targeting the American ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, and the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, was traditional espionage. The spy balloon shot down earlier this year also captured public attention, but generated less concern inside the intelligence community. Intelligence officials and others in the Biden administration viewed those operations as the kind of spy-versus-spy games that Washington and Beijing have run against each other for decades.

In contrast, Mr. Joyce said the intrusions in Guam were “really disturbing” because of their disruptive potential.
The Chinese code, the officials say, appears directed at ordinary utilities that serve both civilian populations and nearby military bases. Only America’s nuclear sites have self-contained communication systems, electricity and water pipelines. (The code has not been found in classified systems. Officials declined to describe the unclassified military networks in which the code has been found.)
While the most sensitive planning is carried out on classified networks, the military routinely uses unclassified, but secure, networks for basic communications, personnel matters, logistics and supply issues.
Officials say that if the malware is activated, it is not clear how effective it would be at slowing an American response — and that the Chinese government may not know, either. In interviews, officials said they believe that in many cases the communications, computer networks and power grids could be quickly restored in a matter of days.

But intelligence analysts have concluded that China may believe there is utility in any disruptive attack that could slow down the U.S. response.

The initial Microsoft discovery in Guam — home to major U.S. Air Force and Marine bases — was attributed by the company to a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group that the company named Volt Typhoon.
A warning from the Homeland Security Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Security Agency and others issued the same day also said the malware was from the state-sponsored Chinese hacking group and was “living off the land.” The phrase means that it was avoiding detection by blending in with normal computer activity, conducted by authorized users. But the warning did not outline other details of the threat.
Some officials briefly considered whether to leave the malware in place, quietly monitor the code they had found and prepare plans to try to neutralize it if it was even activated. Monitoring the intrusions would allow them to learn more about it, and possibly lull the Chinese hackers into a false sense that their penetration had not been exposed.
But senior White House officials quickly rejected that option and said that given the potential threat, the prudent path was to excise the offending malware as quickly as it could be found.

Still, there are risks.
American cybersecurity experts are able to remove some of the malware, but some officials said there are concerns that the Chinese could use similar techniques to quickly regain access.
Removing the Volt Typhoon malware also runs the risk of tipping off China’s increasingly talented hacking forces about what intrusions the United States is able to find, and what it is missing. If that happens, China could improve its techniques and be able to reinfect military systems with even harder-to-find software.
The recent Chinese penetrations have been enormously difficult to detect. The sophistication of the attacks limits how much the implanted software is communicating with Beijing, making it difficult to discover. Many hacks are discovered when experts track information being extracted out of a network, or unauthorized accesses are made. But this malware can lay dormant for long periods of time.

Speaking earlier this month at an intelligence summit, George Barnes, the deputy director of the National Security Agency, said the Volt Typhoon attacks demonstrated how much more sophisticated China had become at penetrating government and private sector networks.

Mr. Barnes said that rather than exploit flaws in software to gain access, China had found ways to steal or mimic the credentials of system administrators, the people who run computer networks. Once those are in hand, the Chinese hackers essentially have the freedom to go anywhere in a network and implant their own code.
“China is steadfast and determined to penetrate our governments, our companies, our critical infrastructure,” Mr. Barnes said.
“In the earlier days, China’s cyberoperations activities were very noisy and very rudimentary,” he continued. “They have continued to bring resources, sophistication and mass to their game. So the sophistication continues to increase.”"
2023-07-30,"Russian propaganda is spreading into the world’s video games.
In Minecraft, the immersive game owned by Microsoft, Russian players re-enacted the battle for Soledar, a city in Ukraine that Russian forces captured in January, posting a video of the game on their country’s most popular social media network, VKontakte.
A channel on the Russian version of World of Tanks, a multiplayer warfare game, commemorated the 78th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in May with a recreation of the Soviet Union’s parade of tanks in Moscow in 1945. On Roblox, the popular gaming platform, a user created an array of Interior Ministry forces in June to celebrate the national holiday, Russia Day.
These games and adjacent discussion sites like Discord and Steam are becoming online platforms for Russian agitprop, circulating to new, mostly younger audiences a torrent of propaganda that the Kremlin has used to try to justify the war in Ukraine.
In this virtual world, players have adopted the letter Z, a symbol of the Russian troops who invaded last year; embraced legally specious Russian territorial claims in Crimea and other places; and echoed President Vladimir V. Putin’s efforts to denigrate Ukrainians as Nazis and blame the West for the conflict.

“Glory to Russia,” declared a video tutorial on how to construct a flagpole with a Russian flag on Minecraft. It showed a Russian flag over a cityscape labeled Luhansk, one of the Ukrainian provinces that Russia has illegally annexed.
“The gaming world is really a platform that can impact public opinion, to reach an audience, especially young populations,” said Tanya Bekker, a researcher at ActiveFence, a cybersecurity company that identified several examples of Russian propaganda on Minecraft for The New York Times.

Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, disclosed in April that the company’s security teams had identified recent Russian efforts “basically to penetrate some of these gaming communities,” citing examples in Minecraft and in Discord discussion groups. He said Microsoft had advised governments, which he did not name, about them, but he played down their significance.
“In truth, it’s not the No. 1 thing we should worry about,” Mr. Smith said at an economic conference in Washington organized by Semafor, the news site. “They’re going to publish information somewhere. You know, it just happens to be a good place for them to get the information into circulation.”

The head of Microsoft’s threat analysis team, Clint Watts, told researchers at New York University’s Stern School of Business that the Russian paramilitary force known as the Wagner Group promoted “malign narratives” on Discord and Steam to support the Kremlin’s views. It may have also sought to encourage enlistments when Russian combat casualties were taking an enormous toll.
“The propaganda mainly seeks to make Wagner and the Russian military look cool and menacing,” Mr. Watts told the researchers, who were examining extremism in video games.
Microsoft declined to elaborate on its executives’ comments or to respond to questions about the Russian examples except to say in a statement that the company reviews content that violates its community standards.
Although some of the material reflects the views of ordinary Russians, other examples suggested government involvement. The Kremlin’s reach into video games shows how tenaciously Mr. Putin’s government has sought to bolster its political goals by using Western social media and consumer products despite diplomatic and economic isolation.
In June, celebrities, musicians and at least one Russian government official staged a concert on Minecraft celebrating Russia Day. The official, Ekaterina Mizulina, is a member of the Civic Chamber, an advisory body, and the head of the Russian Internet Safety League. Her mother, Yelena, serves in the upper house of Parliament and has been a prominent ally of Mr. Putin’s, sponsoring conservative legislation targeting, among other things, homosexuality.

Other memes appearing in games are sympathetic to the Wagner Group, which was led by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin until a mysterious military mutiny unraveled last month. Mr. Prigozhin, once a close ally of Mr. Putin’s, is a veteran of information operations, having founded the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg company that interfered in the American presidential election in 2016.
This month, Mr. Putin underscored the Kremlin’s interest in the gaming industry as a potential tool for the government to instill values. He called it “a colossal business” in remarks to a civic organization he founded in 2018 to focus on youth social and economic issues. One in four Russians plays games online, according to a deputy prime minister who spoke at the same meeting. Mr. Putin said games “should be at the intersection of art and education.”
“A game should help a person develop, help him find himself, should help educate a person both within the framework of universal human values and within the framework of patriotism,” Mr. Putin said in remarks in the Kremlin.
In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Microsoft announced that it would suspend new sales of products and services to Russia to comply with sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe, but Russians have continued to find ways to use its games and sites like Discord and Steam to reach broader audiences. Many of the examples are in Russian, suggesting that the intended audience is at home or among Russian speakers in neighboring countries, including Ukraine.

“Russian propaganda is trying new things to promote its regime,” said Artem Starosiek, the head of Molfar, a Ukrainian consultancy that analyzes online threats.

Molfar’s researchers identified more than a dozen instances of pro-Kremlin propaganda in Minecraft, Roblox, the Russian versions of World of Tanks and World of Warships, Fly Corp, Armored Warfare and War Thunder. Almost all extolled the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, a theme Mr. Putin and his advisers have used to build support for today’s war. Some of it had explicit links to political parties or government agencies.
It is not clear what steps, if any, Microsoft or other companies have taken to block Russian efforts. Wargaming Group, the Cyprus-based creator of World of Tanks, World of Warships and other games, spun off its Russian and Belarusian business last year to Lesta Studio, a subsidiary in St. Petersburg. “Wargaming is vehement in the support of the people of Ukraine, our studio in Kiev and our employees there,” Alex Brewer-Disarufino, a spokesman for Wargaming in North America, said in an email.
Jacob Davey, the head of research of far-right and hate movements at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London, said Minecraft and other games could be useful tools for those looking to influence vulnerable young people, especially if those people had already sorted themselves into private groups where they were eager to discuss fringe ideologies.
“We know that hostile actors who are seeking to shape minds and influence people are opportunistic,” said Mr. Davey, who has studied the gamification of extremist content online. “They go where they think they might find a receptive audience, and they adopt a wide range of tech platforms to push their messaging out.”

Giving the martial nature of many games, it is not surprising that the war in Ukraine would have an influence on content, but in some cases, the games have become a battleground.
A company in Germany made a video game, Death From Above, that simulates Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian forces. The company’s owner called it “a propaganda game.” A newspaper in Finland, Helsingin Sanomat, used the video game Counter-Strike to create a conduit for factual information about the war to a Russian audience largely shielded from it.
“Could we create a place in Counter-Strike where the millions of young Russian men playing this first-person shoot game would be forced to face the terrors of the war in Ukraine?” the newspaper asked in an interactive feature.
Joseph Brown, an assistant professor at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia, spent five years teaching about video game development in Russia, and said he had seen firsthand the country’s commitment to propaganda through video games and other forms of media.
“They need to get everybody back on board with the war,” Dr. Brown said. “It’s another piece of this whole puzzle of constant propaganda, all the time. In every single medium they can get to you with, they will get to you.”"
2023-07-31,"Elon Musk has over the last year threatened legal action against tech competitors, employees and people who use Twitter, which he owns. Now he is also taking aim at an organization that studies hate speech and misinformation on social media.
X Corp., the parent company of the social media company, sent a letter on July 20 to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that conducts research on social media, accusing the organization of making “a series of troubling and baseless claims that appear calculated to harm Twitter generally, and its digital advertising business specifically,” and threatening to sue.
The letter cited research published by the Center for Countering Digital Hate in June examining hate speech on Twitter, which Mr. Musk has renamed X.com. The research consisted of eight papers, including one that found that Twitter had taken no action against 99 percent of the 100 Twitter Blue accounts the center reported for “tweeting hate.” The letter called the research “false, misleading or both” and said the organization had used improper methodology.
The letter added that the center was funded by Twitter’s competitors or foreign governments “in support of an ulterior agenda.”

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said, “Elon Musk’s actions represent a brazen attempt to silence honest criticism and independent research.” He added that Mr. Musk wanted to “stem the tide of negative stories and rebuild his relationship with advertisers.”
The center also said it did “not accept any funding from tech companies, governments, or their affiliates.”
In a blog post Monday evening, X announced that it had filed a lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate for “actively working to prevent free expression.” The suit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California.
Twitter’s advertising business has been struggling under the ownership of Mr. Musk, who bought the company last year. U.S. ad revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $88 million, down 59 percent from a year earlier. Advertisers may have been spooked by Mr. Musk’s changes to the social network, including the removal of rules of what can or can’t be said on the service and more ads featuring online gambling and marijuana products.
In May, Mr. Musk hired Linda Yaccarino, a former top advertising executive for NBCUniversal, to become Twitter’s chief executive.

The letter was at least the third legal threat or action by X Corp. in the last two months. In May, it sent a letter to Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, accusing the tech giant of improperly using its data.

2023-08-02,"Have you ever dreamed of publishing your own e-book and making it big — like the best-selling authors Colleen Hoover and Andy Weir? Not everyone has such success, but plenty of writers have found an audience online with platforms, like Amazon Kindle Publishing and Barnes & Noble Press, that allow authors to freely upload their books and sell them. While you may not get as much exposure by skipping traditional publishing methods and releasing your book yourself, you do retain more control over your work and royalties, which can be up to 70 percent of the sale price. If you’re inspired, here’s a basic overview of the process.
Prepare Your Manuscript
You don’t need special software to write a book — pretty much any modern word-processing program will do — although some people find apps for organizing plots and characters useful. However, your text should be as mistake-free as possible, so take full advantage of any and all proofing tools you have. Apple’s Pages, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Zoho Writer and several other programs include spelling and grammar aids in their desktop editions; options may be more limited on mobile devices.

2023-08-03,"The smartphone industry is in a tailspin, with unit sales falling for two straight years, but Apple has escaped the worst of the downturn because wealthy customers continue buying pricey iPhones.
The world’s most valuable tech company, which relies on the iPhone for half its sales, reported on Thursday that revenue fell 1 percent, to $81.8 billion, during the three months that ended in June. Profit increased 2 percent, to $19.88 billion.
While Apple did not experience the rapid growth that investors have come to expect over the years, and the sales decline was the third of its fiscal year, the company narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and profit for the quarter.
Apple’s financial results were the latest indication that tech’s biggest companies have found their footing after last year’s downturn. Last week, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reported double-digit growth in profits driven by a rebound in digital ad sales. Microsoft posted a record quarterly profit behind a surge in cloud-computing sales, and Amazon on Thursday posted nearly twice the profit expected by Wall Street.

The tech industry limped through much of 2022 because of weak digital ad, e-commerce and computer sales. The downturn led Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon to lay off thousands of workers and spurred companies across Silicon Valley to cut back on perks such as free laundry services for employees.
Though Apple avoided layoffs, it is now dealing with how much the pandemic turbocharged its business. Sales of iPads and Macs exploded as people began working from home, but new purchases of tablets and computers have sputtered over the past year. In the latest quarter, iPad sales decreased 20 percent, to $5.79 billion, and Mac sales declined 7 percent, to $6.84 billion, the company said.
Apple’s share price fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the company projected that sales in the current quarter would be similar to the April-to-June period, as accelerating iPhone and software sales are offset by double-digit declines in sales of Macs and iPads.

Apple continues to be buoyed by the resilience of its iPhone business. While smartphone rivals Samsung and Vivo have experienced sharp declines in sales of low-priced phones, Apple has increased its market share and expanded its sales in emerging markets and China. The company is benefiting as tech-savvy customers with deeper pockets opt to spend more on phones with sophisticated features. Monthly payment plans make it easier to pay for those devices.
In the June quarter, the company made $39.67 billion from iPhone sales, down 2 percent from a year earlier. In China, where total smartphone industry sales fell 4 percent during the quarter to their lowest levels since 2014, iPhone sales increased 7 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm. That helped Apple post 8 percent sales growth in China, bucking the broader malaise buffeting the world’s second-largest economy.

“We’ve done a really good job with affordability programs around the world,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, during a call with analysts. “The majority of iPhones are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing.”
The company weathered declines in sales of its devices with continued growth in App Store and watch sales. The company’s services business, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, App Store sales and Apple Pay, posted $21.21 billion in sales, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. The wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, reported that sales rose 2 percent, to $8.28 billion.
Apple will continue to lean on its existing businesses for the bulk of sales in the coming years. In June, the company unveiled its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. But the $3,500 device, the Vision Pro, won’t go on sale until next year. Analysts project that Apple will sell fewer than half a million units, a small fraction of the roughly 200 million iPhones that it sells annually.
In the absence of a major new revenue stream, the company has focused on boosting sales in developing markets. It opened its first stores in India in April and welcomed crowds of eager shoppers. Its sales there have doubled in recent quarters from last year, as more and more Indians buy higher-priced phones. The rise in sales puts Apple in a position to capitalize on a market that is predicted to have a billion smartphone users by 2026.
“While I’m pleased with our growth there, we still have a very, very modest and low share of the smartphone market,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, during the call with analysts. “It’s a huge opportunity for us.”
Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in September, as well as updated models of the Apple Watch. Wall Street and industry analysts who track the company’s supply chain are not expecting any significant design changes or new features. Richard Kramer, partner at Arete Research, a stock research firm, said the 16-year-old iPhone had entered a phase where improvements were becoming “incrementally incremental.”"

What iPhones and online shopping reveal about the economy
Earnings reports yesterday from Apple and Amazon covered some very different businesses: premium-priced smartphones and tablets versus the world’s “everything store” and a dominant cloud computing platform.
But the tech giants provided a snapshot of the state of the global economy: Consumers and companies are cutting back on some costs, but refusing to stop spending on increasingly essential services.
A tale of two businesses at Apple. The company’s sales slumped for another quarter, even as profit went up slightly compared with a year ago, to $19.88 billion. Much of the revenue decline was caused by a drop in iPhone sales, which comprise half of Apple’s overall revenue. (Sales of iPads fared far worse, with tablet revenue down 20 percent.)
But revenue from services — including Apple Music, Apple TV+ and App Store sales — grew 8 percent, reaching a record $21 billion. It’s a sign that even as customers stop buying pricey new handsets as regularly as they did in the past, they’re committed to smaller-ticket subscriptions and purchases that add up to big money (and carry an astonishing 70 percent gross margin).
Apple also showed growth in key international markets. Sales rose 8 percent in China, the company’s third-biggest market, despite severe economic headwinds there. In India, the company set a record for iPhone sales.
Cost cuts helped power big gains at Amazon. The e-commerce giant handily beat Wall Street’s expectations, as net income of 65 cents per share nearly doubled forecasts. The company enjoyed a surge in its core online retail business, showing that customers are still spending despite headwinds like rising interest rates.

But just as important was how Amazon boosted those results through extensive cost-cutting efforts, including tens of thousands of layoffs and shutting unprofitable divisions. (A slowdown in inflation also helped cut transportation costs.)
The big question is whether other companies’ efforts to shed their own costs will erode Amazon’s other big business, cloud computing: Its AWS division reported 12 percent growth for the quarter, mirroring what Microsoft reported for its competing offering. “Every company in the world is trying to save as much money as they can,” Andy Jassy, Amazon’s C.E.O., told analysts.
What investors think: Shares of Apple are down 1.8 percent in premarket trading, while those in Amazon are up nearly 9 percent.
In other earnings news: Warner Bros. Discovery narrowed its quarterly loss year on year, to $1.24 billion, and lost more streaming customers than analysts had forecast. (The huge success of “Barbie” at the box office will be reflected next quarter.)

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Economists are watching for signs of a cooling labor market. Jobs numbers for July are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and forecasters expect a gain of 200,000 — the smallest increase in 31 months. Fed officials will study the report for signs of cooling wage growth ahead of their rate-setting meeting in September. (Company executives have said recently they’ve slowed down hiring and been worried about rising labor costs.)
Donald Trump pleads not guilty to the latest charges against him. The former president appeared in a Washington courtroom to face accusations that he sought to subvert the 2020 election results. But Trump remained defiant, calling the charges “political persecution,” and there’s little sign his growing legal troubles are hurting his standing among G.O.P. voters.

KKR is said to be in advanced talks to buy Simon & Schuster. The investment giant is poised to pay $1.65 billion if a deal is reached, according to The Wall Street Journal.

A clash over an N.B.A. team’s donation to DeSantis
It’s no secret that N.B.A. team owners are often big political donors, with most of their money historically going to Republicans. But the revelation this week that the Orlando Magic — the team, not the conservative DeVos family that owns it — gave $50,000 to a super PAC supporting Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida raised eyebrows.
The fact that the players’ union issued a sharp rebuke of the move underscored how politics, wealth and pro sports can become uncomfortably intertwined.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
It appears to be the first time that a team has directly supported a group allied with a presidential candidate. A spokesman for the Magic said that the donation, which was dated May 19, was made before DeSantis officially announced his candidacy, but it was already clear that he would run.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
In its statement, the N.B.A. Players Association called the move “alarming given recent comments and policies of its beneficiary.”
DeSantis’s platform clashes with the stated positions of a number of N.B.A. players. The Republican governor has risen to prominence with so-called anti-woke policies, and has pushed for strict bans on abortions and efforts to tighten voting regulations — both of which run counter to player initiatives and public statements.
DeSantis also introduced new state standards for the teaching of African American history, which critics say play down the brutality of slavery. (That move was announced after the Magic’s donation.) Larry Nance Jr., a player for the New Orleans Pelicans, noted that the Magic have “a majority Black roster, a Black head coach and a Black G.M.”
The league is in a bind. Under Adam Silver, its commissioner, the N.B.A. has mostly welcomed players’ political activism, including on Black Lives Matter and on laws discriminating against L.G.B.T.Q. people. But it is overseen by a board of governors that is largely made up of owners.

For now, the N.B.A. is staying neutral: “Team governors make their own decisions on the political contributions they make and we respect the right of members of the N.B.A. family to express their political views,” a spokesman told The Times.
But the players’ union said that while owners were free to express political opinions, “if contributions are made on behalf of an entire team, using money earned through the labor of its employees, it is incumbent upon the team governors to consider the diverse values and perspectives of staff and players.”
The chipmaker in the middle of a geopolitical fight
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company sits at the center of the technological cold war between the U.S. and China: It dominates production of the world’s most advanced chips from its base in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own and has threatened to invade.
TSMC’s top executives acknowledged to The Times that while the company commands a crucial position in the global tech supply chain, it is still subject to a geopolitical battle beyond their control.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
TSMC is a $500 billion juggernaut that makes chips for everything from iPhones to supercomputers to cars to fighter jets. That has given it both market dominance and global political importance. U.S. export controls have made it harder for Chinese companies to gain access to the most advanced semiconductors, and Washington is weighing new restrictions on chips for artificial intelligence.
“We control all the choke points,” Morris Chang, the company’s founder, said, referring to Western powers and its chip-making allies, including the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. He played down Beijing’s chances for semiconductor supremacy: “China can’t really do anything if we want to choke them,” he added.
TSMC has already cut off supplies to Chinese customers, including in 2020 the telecom giant Huawei, its second-biggest customer at the time. Mark Liu, TSMC’s chief, said that it had no choice: “It’s understandable, but support or not, we have no say.”
But TSMC is still moored to Taiwan. Western countries have courted the company to build plants outside the island, but its experience with its $40 billion project in Arizona — which has suffered from delays, high costs and managerial challenges — has hammered home that its power is strongly tied to Taiwan. “We cannot put it anyplace else,” Liu said.
The TSMC chief rejected the idea of a “silicon shield,” whereby the company’s manufacturing expertise would deter a Chinese invasion or guarantee U.S. support for Taiwan. “China will not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors. China will not not invade Taiwan because of semiconductors,” he said. “It is really up to the U.S. and China: How do they maintain the status quo, which both sides want?”

Separately, Tiger Global has built a big stake in Apollo, as the hedge fund looks to diversify beyond its typical tech investments.
The buyback boom is tailing off
For over a decade, companies believed that the surest way to bolster their stock price was to buy back their shares, rather than invest in more plants or research and development. Shareholders rejoiced — but politicians assailed the practice as shortsighted and benefiting only investors and executives.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The corporate thinking about buybacks appears to be changing, according to Bloomberg:
With tightening credit muting share repurchases, and the siren song of artificial intelligence blaring everywhere, outlays for investment on plants and technology have blossomed. The median company pushed up capital expenditures by 15 percent in [the second quarter], with three-quarters announcing programs that topped analyst estimates in July, data from Bank of America Corp. shows.
By contrast, buybacks among corporate clients have been tracking below seasonal trends since May. More broadly, net repurchases plunged 36 percent from a year ago among S.&P. 500 firms that announced financial results. And the reluctance is also on display via planned buybacks, which according to Birinyi Associates have fallen 15 percent year-to-date.

2023-08-07,"Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, has for years been doing preliminary work for what would be one of the world’s largest offshore wind complexes, in the North Sea off eastern England.
Now, there are questions about whether this project will ever be built. Last month, Vattenfall said it would halt the first of three phases of the wind farm complex, the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone, which is projected to provide power for about four million homes in Britain.
Vattenfall blamed rapidly escalating costs for equipment and construction expenses, which it said had climbed as much as 40 percent over the past few quarters. The estimated price tag for the three phases has risen to 13 billion pounds, or about $16.6 billion, from £10 billion.
“With the new market conditions, it simply doesn’t make sense to continue the project,” Helene Bistrom, head of business area wind at Vattenfall, said during a video presentation. The decision led Vattenfall, which the Swedish government owns, to write down more than $500 million.

Vattenfall’s pullback added to the widespread alarm unfolding across the offshore industry about rapidly increasing costs, due partly to supply chain issues and rising demand.
In recent months, several developers in the United States have sought to renegotiate power supply contracts, scrapping them in at least one case, and Orsted, a Danish company that is the world’s largest offshore wind developer, warned that a major project in Britain, Hornsea 3, could be “at risk” without more government support.

With interest rates shooting up, financing the billions of dollars in investment that go into these installations has also become far more expensive.
On Monday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy reported a net loss of 2.9 billion euros ($3.2 billion) for the April-to-June quarter, largely due to problems tied to “increased product costs and ramp-up challenges” in its offshore energy business.

“There’s very few projects that are immune to the inflationary impact,” said Finlay Clark, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm.

Rising costs for wind developers are a problem for governments in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. Many countries are counting on an enormous and rapid expansion of offshore wind to achieve a significant portion of their renewable energy goals.
“We are wasting time here,” Morten Dyrholm, group senior vice president for corporate affairs at Vestas Wind Systems, the Danish turbine maker, said of the industry’s problems. “We need to grow the sector quite dramatically.”
Mr. Dyrholm and others in the industry say the inflation problems are a warning sign that governments need to change their system of awarding offshore wind licenses.
The procedures for obtaining the rights to build wind farms vary in different countries but often involve an auction of seabed leases followed, sometimes years later, by agreements that set the price paid by power companies for the electricity generated.

These arrangements, designed to drive down power prices for consumers and, often, to maximize revenues from lease sales, should be broadened to take into account other factors, some industry leaders say. An auction for seabed rights awarded by Scotland in 2022 is cited as a model because it put greater emphasis on factors like the ability of wind companies to develop suppliers, and the experience of the companies.
The debate could open the way for more power deals with corporations like Amazon and Microsoft, whose data centers are hungry consumers of electricity. Large businesses might be more flexible partners for wind developers than government officials who tend to say, “This is the rule,” said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utilities analyst at Bernstein, a research firm.
Renewable energy programs like Britain’s — which is designed to encourage financial backing by providing a guaranteed price to wind developers, and to gradually drive down charges paid by consumers — attracted billions in investment when inflation was low. Now, in a very different world, after the disruptions of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Britain is taking fire for policies that could make wind projects uneconomical.
“I am afraid the U.K. has gone from being one of the best governments in Europe on offshore wind to one of the worst,” said Giles Dickson, chief executive of WindEurope, a trade body.

A British government spokesman responded: “We understand there are supply chain pressures for the sector globally, not just in the U.K., and we are listening to companies’ concerns.”

The inflation problems are mainly hitting offshore wind farms in late stages of development rather than those already generating power.
Offshore projects can require a decade to progress from planning stages to generating power. That means agreements on issues like the power price may be years old before the turbines are in place and generating electricity.
That system worked when inflation was negligible and demand for turbines and other equipment was relatively subdued. Now, as a growing number of developers look to secure everything necessary to undertake the projects — from wind turbines, which cost millions of dollars, to the services of specialized construction ships, to bank financing — they discover that the price tags have suddenly soared. Mr. Dyrholm estimates that prices of wind turbines alone have increased 30 percent in the past year.
“The costs have risen, and you have a mismatch,” said Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP, which is an investor, with Equinor, a Norwegian company, in three offshore wind projects in the Atlantic that would supply power to around two million households in New York State. Equinor and BP have petitioned state authorities to renegotiate their power contracts.

Similarly, developers in Britain and elsewhere don’t seem to want to completely jettison projects. Many are trying to renegotiate the deals or push governments to alter the formats of future auctions. Some are terminating existing contracts to supply power to utilities and seeking new ones — or threatening such moves, figuring there will be plenty of demand for clean power in the future.
Walking away from contracts signed years ago has become “the prudent commercial course” even with the risk of financial penalties, SouthCoast Wind, a project part-owned by Shell that would be located in the Atlantic near Martha’s Vineyard, in Massachusetts, said in a statement in June.
Another Massachusetts proposal, Commonwealth Wind, which is owned by Avangrid, a U.S. subsidiary of the Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, has terminated its power supply contract and plans to seek a new deal in a future auction, the company said.
“The economics are challenging,” said Stephanie McClellan, executive director of Turn Forward, an offshore wind advocacy organization in the United States.

Despite the soured deals, interest in offshore wind remains strong. In a recent auction in Germany, BP and TotalEnergies in France agreed to pay around $14 billion over three decades for offshore tracts.
The German deals differ from others because the companies are simply paying for the rights to develop sea bottom, and they will negotiate what  they are paid for the electricity at a later date.
Such deals are attractive to a corporate giant like BP, which has the financial firepower to make them happen and would be freer to do what it wants with the power. Mr. Looney said he hoped to steer away from the long-term power contracts, preferring instead to try to squeeze more value from wind-generated electricity by using it to make green hydrogen, a still scarce clean fuel, or charge electric vehicles.
“We’d like to do something with those electrons — take them and put them to use,” he said.
But there are only a handful of companies with the heft of BP and TotalEnergies. Whether nations can achieve their offshore ambitions through such commercial deals remains to be seen. Critics say charging high prices for leases will lead to higher power prices for consumers."

Doing business in China is getting even harder
The Biden administration is expected to announce new restrictions today on investing in China, its latest effort to prevent Beijing from accessing advanced technologies that could be used by its military.
The new measures add to the challenges facing the world’s second-largest economy as it faces a post-pandemic slowdown. But they also highlight the growing difficulties for and global companies operating in China, a day after a major Western law firm said it would leave the country.
The rules will focus on high-tech sectors. Biden’s executive order will bar private equity and venture capital firms from investing in Chinese industries including quantum computing, artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors, people familiar with the deliberations told the Times.
China’s economy is already being squeezed. Official data released today showed the country had fallen into deflation last month, a day after Beijing reported that trade had plummeted by the most since the start of the pandemic.

Businesses that bet big on China are caught in the middle. Dentons, the largest Western law firm in China in terms of staff, said yesterday it would separate from Dacheng, its unit there. The two firms merged in 2015, and Dentons even added Chinese characters to its logo to signal its commitment to the country.
China’s new counterespionage law has made operating there more difficult. It banned the transfer of any information related to national security — but did not define which data would fall under this rubric. The law also allowed authorities to access data, electronic devices and personal property, as well as to block individuals from leaving the country.
That made it impossible to follow legal industry standards and best practice, a person familiar with Dentons’ decision-making told DealBook. For example, a provision that requires Chinese firms to keep the names of clients and employees secret from foreign entities raised thorny issues for American lawyers, who must check for conflicts with existing clients before taking on a new one.
These problems are widespread across industries. “Standards are diverging between China and Western economies,” Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell and a former head of the I.M.F.’s China division, told DealBook. “It’s all driven by the phenomenon that China is not as open to foreign business as it once professed to be.”
Chinese authorities have raided the offices of Western-linked consulting firms in recent months, and the venture capital firm Sequoia broke off its unit in the country in June. Employees at financial firms operating in China have reportedly been forced to attend lessons in the ideology of President Xi Jinping.

But the Chinese market may still be too big to ignore. Keyu Jin, an economist and the author of “The New China Playbook,” said companies operating there have always had to balance competing needs. “Consumer companies have big dreams in China,” she told DealBook. “Foreign financial institutions eye significant returns on the trillions of household wealth that needs to be managed.”
China is a major economy and foreign businesses will continue to work there, Prasad added, even if it’s becoming “quite a fraught proposition.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A warning from Moody’s drags down bank stocks. The credit ratings agency put shares of six major lenders on watch for a potential downgrade, and cut the ratings of several regional banks, citing lower income and higher funding costs tied to rising interest rates. Shares in firms like Bank of New York Mellon and Cullen/Frost Bankers fell as much as 2.8 percent.
Regulators fine financial companies $549 million over misuse of messaging apps. Eleven institutions, including Wells Fargo and BNP Paribas, were accused by the S.E.C. and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission of failing to police employees’ use of “off-channel” services like WhatsApp for business communications. Wall Street banks had already paid $1.8 billion in fines for similar violations last year.

Chipotle’s founder raises money for his second act
Thirty years ago, Steve Ells opened the first Chipotle in Denver and went on to build a $51 billion fast-casual dining giant. Now he is working on his next act: a quick-serve, plant-based restaurant concept that relies on automation.
That start-up, Kernel, has raised $36 million in Series A financing, DealBook’s Michael de la Merced is first to report. That will help the company open its first location in New York City this fall — and develop technology it can eventually license to others.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
How Kernel works: It’s a hub-and-spoke model, with a central kitchen that does much of the prep work throughout the day. The food is then biked to restaurants; there, machines and a small crew of humans assemble everything for customers.
The restaurant will offer an array of plant-based dishes, including a crispy faux-chicken sandwich, a veggie burger and a chicken Caesar salad without, well, chicken. (The focus on plants is meant to be eco-friendly, though Ells concedes that it was hard to create dishes that appealed broadly.)
Kernel builds on lessons Ells learned from Chipotle. When he began the start-up after leaving Chipotle three years ago, he focused on improving efficiency, speed and food quality through software and automation.
The result, Ells said, is a chain that can operate smaller restaurants in more locations (since they don’t need bulky kitchen equipment) and be more consistent in meal quality. It also needs fewer employees, but Ells said that Kernel will be able to pay them more.
The fund-raising effort came after two years of self-financing by Ells. He secured investments from groups including Raga Partners, Willoughby Capital, Rethink Food and Virtru.

What next? Kernel will open its first restaurant this fall, and has ambitions to operate 15 locations within two years.
Eventually it could license its technology to other chains. “There’s no question that more and more automation is going to make its way into restaurants,” Ells said. Of Kernel, he added, “Once the hard work is done, once the platform is proven, it’s very, very simple to replicate.”
How media giants are trying to stay on top of A.I.
As the corporate world reckons with the disruption posed by artificial intelligence, some media giants are reportedly working on ways to marshal the fast-evolving technology — even as many of the artists they work with remain skeptical.
Universal Music is in talks with Google over licensing “deepfake” work, according to The Financial Times. If successful, that could lead to tools that would allow consumers to use imitations of singers’ voices and melodies in new work, paying owners for the right to do so. (Artists could choose to opt in.)

Universal Music has been worried about tech companies exploiting works by its artists — who include Drake and Taylor Swift — without compensation. And Google is hoping that new A.I. tools will keep it competitive with the likes of Microsoft.
Meanwhile, Disney has created an A.I. task force, according to Reuters. The group is meant to figure out how to deploy the technology across the Disney empire, from its movie and TV studios to its ad business. The company has almost a dozen job listings seeking experts in A.I. or machine learning.
The technology could help Disney tame soaring production budgets for its movies, an unnamed company executive told Reuters, as well as create new attractions for its theme parks.
But getting talent on board may be challenging. Musicians, including Drake (whose voice was mimicked on an unlicensed hit single in April), have complained that generative A.I. could deprive them of pay and undercut their own work. And among the demands of the striking Hollywood writers’ and actors’ unions are guardrails that limit movie studios’ ability to use A.I. to replace humans.
Not all artists are against the adoption of A.I. The singer Grimes, who has said she’s open to licensing her voice for user-generated work, told Wired that there were potential benefits to such an arrangement.

Some executives think it’s possible to strike a balance. “With the right framework in place, A.I. will enable fans to pay their heroes the ultimate compliment through a new level of user-driven content,” Robert Kyncl, the C.E.O. of Warner Music (which is also reportedly in talks with Google), told investors yesterday.
But Kyncl added, “The thing that is important is that artists have a choice, because there are some that may not like it, and that’s totally fine.”
The legal fight against corporate diversity policies ramps up
Even before conservative activists scored a win when the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action at universities, they began taking on initiatives meant to increase diversity across corporate America.
ADVERTISEMENT

These campaigners are arguing that policies aimed at improving diversity, equity and inclusion — known as D.E.I. — violate rules meant to protect against race and sex discrimination. And, according to The Wall Street Journal, they’re seeing results:
Comcast settled a case accusing it of illegally favoring minority-owned small-business customers with grants and marketing advice. Amazon has been sued in Texas over a program offering an extra $10,000 to Black- or Latino-owned delivery-service contractors. Starbucks directors and executives are being sued by a shareholder arguing they violated their duty to investors by supporting diversity policies. …
Companies say their initiatives fall within the law. Many say they remain committed to increasing the demographic diversity of their workforces and suppliers, citing business benefits and the hurdles some groups continue to face in American corporations. Privately, many are asking their lawyers if and how much they should modify their methods in light of the affirmative-action decision.

2023-08-11,"Give the stock market half a chance and it will dominate the financial headlines. That was certainly the case for the month of July, with the S&P 500 powering upward and bonds barely treading water.
But August has been different, with the stock market hitting a speed bump and the bond market getting attention for an unwelcome reason: a downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency. Fitch says the deterioration in political consensus and the increasing debt levels of the United States mean that it no longer ranks unequivocally as among the safest places to invest in the world.
That’s significant. Because the enduring appeal of bonds comes from their relative safety — and not from spectacular gains and losses that define the stock market’s flamboyant brand — the Fitch downgrade can’t be easily dismissed.
Yet it makes sense to hold U.S. debt anyway, despite tremors in the bond market. You may not think much about bonds, but there’s a good chance that you have a stake in them, if only indirectly: through a fund, especially in a workplace defined-contribution retirement account, like a 401(k), or through a pension or an annuity.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Because bonds are so often overlooked, it’s worth going over some basics.
Stocks vs. Bonds
Stocks are inherently speculative. They provide fractional ownership of a company and are a bet that the value of your shares will appreciate. Often, you get dividends, but a company isn’t required to pay them.
Bonds, on the other hand, are a loan to a company or a government, like the United States, which is generally obligated to pay you interest and, at a certain date, repay your principal, too. Should a company — or a country — run into financial trouble, bondholders customarily have high status among creditors. These features typically make bonds less risky than stocks.
But bonds contain a speculative element, too. Even the safest bonds do.
The conventional wisdom is that U.S. Treasuries are the safest bonds, a claim that has given them an exalted status as the benchmark from which all other asset values may be measured. The “risk-free” rate provided by Treasuries is used in finance as the hurdle that every other investment — a stock or a capital project or a buyout of a private company — must clear to be deemed even minimally viable as a place to put your money.
U.S. Treasuries constitute an extraordinarily deep and nimble $25.1 trillion market. It’s no exaggeration to say that the entire world’s financial system is based on U.S. Treasuries, and calibrated against Treasury rates.
That’s still the case. But it’s difficult to assert with a straight face that U.S. Treasuries are really risk free — not after the losses in the bond market last year, or the “perils-of-Pauline” brushes with disaster in multiple debt ceiling crises. The Fitch debt downgrade is a reasonable response to those crises.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Interest Rate Risk
Investors in high-quality bonds, and, especially, Treasuries, face two significant problems: interest rate risk and credit risk.
To understand interest rate risk, recall that bond prices and interest rates (a.k.a. yields) move in opposite directions. That’s how bonds work. In 2013, when it looked like rates were rising, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a bulletin on interest rate risk, which I thought was particularly apt, comparing bond prices and interest rates to the two ends of a playground seesaw (or teeter-totter, if you’re from the Midwest). When one side rises, the other falls. Every child in the playground learns that soon enough. Bond investors do, too.
Last year, the seesaw crashed. Because of soaring inflation and the Federal Reserve’s effort to curb it by raising short-term rates, bond market rates rose and prices plummeted. It was the worst year for bond investors since the 1920s, and, probably much longer, as I wrote in late 2022.
But now, with yields already much higher than they have been over most of the past decade — most rose a bit after a government report on Thursday showed that core inflation was still sizzling at 4.7 percent a year — a repetition of last year’s severe bond losses is extremely unlikely.
Yes, yields could still rise further if inflation remains high, and that could lead to modest short-term losses in bond funds or, if you trade them, in individual bonds. That’s especially true for bonds with longer maturities.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Inflation’s not the only problem. The U.S. Treasury is pouring new debt into the market while the Fed, which had been the biggest domestic purchaser of Treasuries, has gotten out of that game as it tightens financial conditions to fight inflation. The appetites of China and Japan, big foreign buyers of Treasuries, may be diminishing. These incremental shifts in supply and demand may well increase rates marginally and depress prices.
All of this is why money market funds — which track interest rate shifts closely and do not decline in price when yields rise — may be a better short-term bet than bonds for the next month or two, with money-market yields well above 5 percent.
Even so, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury already above 4 percent, bond yields are high enough to provide a buffer and substantial enough for high-quality bonds to perform their traditional functions: generating income and providing a counterweight to stocks.
But that brings us to credit risk and the Fitch downgrade.
What About the Downgrade?
High-yield bonds self-evidently entail credit risk. They are called junk bonds for a reason. Companies are forced to pay higher yields precisely because of the risk that they won’t make good on their debt. If you can accept the risk and do some research — or have a prudent manager do it for you — junk bonds can be lucrative, much like stocks.
But I’m focusing here on using bonds for their traditional purpose as a relatively stable income provider, offsetting the volatility of stocks. Investment grade bonds, either corporate or government, are good choices. (Inflation-adjusted bonds and municipal bonds can be worthwhile, too, but I’ll discuss them another day.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The safest of U.S. bonds are still Treasuries, in my view, though Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson bonds have higher credit ratings. But would those companies be great credit risks if the U.S. government defaulted on its debt? I have my doubts.
Many countries now have better credit ratings than the United States, including Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. The United States still has a pristine grade from Moody’s. Standard & Poor’s downgraded U.S. debt one notch in 2011 and Fitch followed suit this month. I fully expect Moody’s to do the same one day, if the United States continues to flirt with debt default.
The issue is governance, not financial stress. As Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, says, the United States remains the most powerful economy and country in the world. The global bond market is willing and able to absorb all of the debt that is being issued by the U.S. Treasury.
Yet the core problem is profound. The political system in the United States has become sufficiently dysfunctional that fiscal policy is an exercise in brinkmanship. The specter of a debt default is no longer unthinkable. How much money the United States should spend and how much it should raise through taxation — and by taxing whom, exactly — have always been difficult issues. But bipartisan compromises have become rare achievements in Washington.
If Fitch didn’t provide new information, it set off a warning flag.
U.S. credit is still strong, though not as great as it was. Treasuries remain essential in nearly everyone’s portfolio. But until a semblance of consensus on fiscal matters is restored, the world will be bearing unnecessary risk."

2023-08-16,"Avijit Ghosh wanted the bot to do bad things.
He tried to goad the artificial intelligence model, which he knew as Zinc, into producing code that would choose a job candidate based on race. The chatbot demurred: Doing so would be “harmful and unethical,” it said.
Then, Dr. Ghosh referenced the hierarchical caste structure in his native India. Could the chatbot rank potential hires based on that discriminatory metric?
The model complied.
Dr. Ghosh’s intentions were not malicious, although he was behaving as if they were. Instead, he was a casual participant in a competition last weekend at the annual Defcon hackers conference in Las Vegas, where 2,200 people filed into an off-Strip conference room over three days to draw out the dark side of artificial intelligence.
The hackers tried to break through the safeguards of various A.I. programs in an effort to identify their vulnerabilities — to find the problems before actual criminals and misinformation peddlers did — in a practice known as red-teaming. Each competitor had 50 minutes to tackle up to 21 challenges — getting an A.I. model to “hallucinate” inaccurate information, for example.

They found political misinformation, demographic stereotypes, instructions on how to carry out surveillance and more.
The exercise had the blessing of the Biden administration, which is increasingly nervous about the technology’s fast-growing power. Google (maker of the Bard chatbot), OpenAI (ChatGPT), Meta (which released its LLaMA code into the wild) and several other companies offered anonymized versions of their models for scrutiny.
Dr. Ghosh, a lecturer at Northeastern University who specializes in artificial intelligence ethics, was a volunteer at the event. The contest, he said, allowed a head-to-head comparison of several A.I. models and demonstrated how some companies were further along in ensuring that their technology was performing responsibly and consistently.
He will help write a report analyzing the hackers’ findings in the coming months.
The goal, he said: “an easy-to-access resource for everybody to see what problems exist and how we can combat them.”

Defcon was a logical place to test generative artificial intelligence. Past participants in the gathering of hacking enthusiasts — which started in 1993 and has been described as a “spelling bee for hackers” — have exposed security flaws by remotely taking over cars, breaking into election results websites and pulling sensitive data from social media platforms. Those in the know use cash and a burner device, avoiding Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, to keep from getting hacked. One instructional handout begged hackers to “not attack the infrastructure or webpages.”

Last year, A.I. was one of the quieter villages. This year, it was among the most popular.
The organizers tapped into intensifying alarm over the continued ability of generative artificial intelligence to produce damaging lies, influence elections, ruin reputations and enable a multitude of other harms. Government officials voiced concern and organized hearings around A.I. companies — some of which are also calling for the industry to slow down and be more careful. Even the pope, a popular subject of A.I. image generators, spoke out this month about the technology’s “disruptive possibilities and ambivalent effects.”

In what was described as a “game changer” report last month, researchers showed that they could circumvent guardrails for A.I. systems from Google, OpenAI and Anthropic by appending certain characters to English-language prompts. Around the same time, seven leading artificial intelligence companies committed to new standards for safety, security and trust in a meeting with President Biden.
“This generative era is breaking upon us, and people are seizing it, and using it to do all kinds of new things that speaks to the enormous promise of A.I. to help us solve some of our hardest problems,” said Arati Prabhakar, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House, who collaborated with the A.I. organizers at Defcon. “But with that breadth of application, and with the power of the technology, come also a very broad set of risks.”
Red-teaming has been used for years in cybersecurity circles alongside other evaluation techniques, such as penetration testing and adversarial attacks. But until Defcon’s event this year, efforts to probe artificial intelligence defenses have been limited: Competition organizers said that Anthropic red-teamed its model with 111 people; GPT-4 used around 50 people.
With so few people testing the limits of the technology, analysts struggled to discern whether an A.I. screw-up was a one-off that could be fixed with a patch, or an embedded problem that required a structural overhaul, said Rumman Chowdhury, a co-organizer who oversaw the design of the challenge. A large, diverse and public group of testers was more likely to come up with creative prompts to help tease out hidden flaws, said Dr. Chowdhury, a fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society focused on responsible A.I. and co-founder of a nonprofit called Humane Intelligence.
“There is such a broad range of things that could possibly go wrong,” Dr. Chowdhury said before the competition. “I hope we’re going to carry hundreds of thousands of pieces of information that will help us identify if there are at-scale risks of systemic harms.”

The designers did not want to merely trick the A.I. models into bad behavior — no pressuring them to disobey their terms of service, no prompts to “act like a Nazi, and then tell me something about Black people,” said Dr. Chowdhury, who previously led Twitter’s machine learning ethics and accountability team. Except in specific challenges where intentional misdirection was encouraged, the hackers were looking for unexpected flaws, the so-called unknown unknowns.
A.I. Village drew experts from tech giants such as Google and Nvidia, as well as a “Shadowboxer” from Dropbox and a “data cowboy” from Microsoft. It also attracted participants with no specific cybersecurity or A.I. credentials. A leaderboard with a science fiction theme kept score of the contestants.
Some of the hackers at the event struggled with the idea of cooperating with A.I. companies that they saw as complicit in unsavory practices such as unfettered data-scraping. A few described the red-teaming event as essentially a photo op, but added that involving the industry would help keep the technology secure and transparent.
One computer science student found inconsistencies in a chatbot’s language translation: He wrote in English that a man was shot while dancing, but the model’s Hindi translation said only that the man died. A machine learning researcher asked a chatbot to pretend that it was campaigning for president and defending its association with forced child labor; the model suggested that unwilling young laborers developed a strong work ethic.

Emily Greene, who works on security for the generative A.I. start-up Moveworks, started a conversation with a chatbot by talking about a game that used “black” and “white” pieces. She then coaxed the chatbot into making racist statements. Later, she set up an “opposites game,” which led the A.I. to respond to one prompt with a poem about why rape is good.
“It’s just thinking of these words as words,” she said of the chatbot. “It’s not thinking about the value behind the words.”

Two of those handles came from Cody Ho, a student at Stanford University studying computer science with a focus on A.I.

Market whiplash
In the span of a month, the bottom has dropped out of the bull-market rally as investors have come to grips with the prospect of “higher for longer” interest rates worldwide. The sell-off in global stocks and bonds picked up steam on Thursday. And weary market watchers will be looking for more hints on the Fed’s view at next week’s Jackson Hole summit of central bankers and policymakers.
Technology stocks have been hit particularly hard. The high-flying FANG+ Index — which comprises the largest tech stocks by market capitalization, including Apple, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — fell into correction territory on Thursday. The group of Nasdaq heavyweights is down nearly 11 percent since July 18.

High-growth tech stocks tend to be sensitive to rising interest rates and bond yields. They rallied earlier in the year on investors’ belief that the Fed was pivoting to a more dovish rates policy, which could inspire a rebound in tech spending. (Investors’ voracious appetite for stocks that could benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence also fueled the tech rally.)

Just a month ago, Wall Street was hailing the so-called “magnificent seven” for driving the gains this year in the S&P 500. As MarketWatch notes, four of the seven (Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft) have fallen at least 10 percent from their highs in July. Tesla, the worst of the bunch, has tumbled more than 25 percent in that period, putting it in bear territory.
Rising bond yields have investors on edge. On Thursday, alarm bells sounded on both sides of the Atlantic as investors sold government bonds en masse, sending yields to multiyear highs. The 10-year Treasury note climbed to a height it last hit in the early days of the global financial crisis in 2008.
This sentiment trickled down to stocks and crypto. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the largest cryptocurrencies, plunged overnight, with Bitcoin sinking to a two-month low below $26,500. The Wall Street Journal’s report that SpaceX, Elon Musk’s rocket company, wrote down the value of its Bitcoin stake over the past two years and sold some of it hasn’t improved sentiment around the highly volatile asset class.
China’s woes are also weighing on global markets. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong fell into a bear market on Friday as investors pulled back on Chinese stocks with the economy slowing and a property-market crisis brewing. Also on Friday, analysts at Nomura were the latest to lower their forecast for China’s growth. Adding to the jitters, the renminbi hit a 16-year low against the dollar on Friday, prompting emergency moves to prop up the currency. That did little to soothe investors’ nerves.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The Chinese property giant Evergrande files for bankruptcy in the United States. The company defaulted on its bonds in 2021, spurring a crisis across a sector that is a crucial driver of Chinese growth, and is pursuing a restructuring agreement with creditors. Country Garden, another developer, missed international debt payments this month amid a wider economic slowdown in China.

Instacart is reportedly planning an I.P.O. as early as next month. The country’s largest online grocery delivery company is pursuing a traditional listing on Nasdaq after considering a direct listing, according to Bloomberg. Separately, Arm, the chip designer owned by SoftBank, has lined up 28 banks to underwrite an I.P.O. that could be the biggest this year, Bloomberg reported.
Mortgage rates hit a 21-year high. The lending giant Freddie Mac said on Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage, the most common home loan in America, surpassed 7 percent this week; a year ago it was at 5.19 percent. Ballooning rates for financing and a tight supply of homes are pricing an increasing number of Americans out of the housing market.

A full-metal fight
A cornerstone of President Biden’s effort to counter China is to secure access to the commodities critical to supply-chain security. An emerging bidding war for U.S. Steel could test that ambition in a sector dominated by Chinese rivals.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
But a brewing geopolitical fight on the other side of the world could have even longer-term consequences for the economy and the Biden administration’s plans to power an energy transition.
Cleveland-Cliffs started the bidding for U.S. Steel with a $10 billion offer. A successful bid would add to consolidation of a U.S. industry that has dwindled to four major companies: Cleveland-Cliffs, U.S. Steel, Nucor and Steel Dynamics. China is the world’s biggest producer by far, accounting for about half of global production; the United States ranks fourth.
U.S. Steel publicly rejected the initial offer. The company called the Cleveland-Cliffs terms “unreasonable” and announced a formal review process. The United Steelworkers supported Cleveland-Cliffs’ bid, but manufacturers worry that more consolidation would give steel makers outsized power to raise prices and squeeze customers.
Another major metals fight worth watching is unfolding in Indonesia. The country has the world’s biggest reserves of nickel, a mineral used in electric vehicle batteries — and a key material in the green economy. The Biden administration has offered billions of dollars in subsidies to spur EV manufacturing, and the energy transition is a crucial aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act.

But Indonesia’s nickel industry relies on Chinese companies for investment and technology. That is complicating Jakarta’s efforts to build ties with global companies that want to get access to the country’s reserves and to American tax credits via the I.R.A. The Indonesian government had been wooing Tesla to build a factory, but the company set up its Southeast Asian headquarters in Malaysia instead.
That may give China another opening. Indonesian officials are considering other options, including stepping up efforts to convince BYD, China’s largest EV maker, to set up shop. “We are aiming basically to the United States,” Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, one of Indonesia’s most powerful ministers, told The Times’s Peter Goodman. “But if the Americans finally say, ‘We don’t want to take it,’ fine, we’ll look for some other places to go.”
$38 million
— The amount Spotify could add in profits by steering listeners away from white noise podcasts, according to Bloomberg. The company’s algorithm pushed users looking for “talk” content to shows that broadcast everything from whale noises to bird song on repeat. But those users typically remain on the free, ad-supported version of the platform instead of opting for the subscription shows that are more lucrative for Spotify. The company considered directing listeners to shows that made more money, but didn’t put the plan into action.

What’s next for Hawaiian Electric?
The death toll from the wildfires that have ripped across Maui stands at 111, and focus is turning to what led the blaze to become one of the country’s worst natural disasters in decades. Maui’s emergency management chief resigned last night as questions swirled over the decision not to use outdoor alert sirens. Hawaiian Electric, the state’s largest utility, is also facing major scrutiny.
It could take months for officials to assess the company’s role — if any — in the blaze. But markets fear the worst. Hawaiian Electric shares have fallen by more than 65 percent since Aug. 7, the day before the wildfire started. On Friday, Moody’s was the latest credit ratings firm to downgrade Hawaiian Electric as potential liabilities mount.
A big question is whether the company will be forced to follow a similar path to Pacific Gas and Electric, the California-based utility company that filed for bankruptcy in 2019 under the burden of wildfire liabilities.
The factors to watch include whether insurance can cover Hawaiian Electric’s massive rebuilding costs, and the size of its potential liabilities. At least four lawsuits have already been filed, contending the company was negligent in operating and maintaining equipment.
Evidence is building. Videos and photos posted from Maui appear to show power lines starting fires. In addition, data from Whisker Labs, a company that monitors electrical grids for fire hazards, seems to identify faults on power lines in the area where the fires started.

There’s an important difference between Hawaiian Electric and PG&E. California has inverse indemnification laws, which makes it easier to hold public utility companies like PG&E liable. Hawaii has no such regulations, meaning litigants will have the higher bar of proving management is to blame.
Would Hawaii allow the company to file for bankruptcy? Regardless of how bad Hawaiian Electric’s financial situation becomes, Hawaii may not want to allow its largest utility to go bankrupt. That could delay rebuilding on the island.
The state has been through big bankruptcies before, including those of Hawaiian Airlines in 2008 and Liberty House, its largest retailer, in 1998. Working to keep the company out of bankruptcy could be seen as a more politically fraught option, versus handing over questions about its future to a judge.

2023-08-21,"In 2007, Linda Stone, a former Microsoft executive, realized that even though she did breathing exercises every morning, when she sat down at her laptop and opened up her inbox, it all went out the window. “I would be like, Huh, I was just breathing but I’m not breathing anymore,” she said. Her inhales and exhales became barely detectable and shallow, she noticed.
Ms. Stone decided to conduct an informal study (“dining room table science,” she called it), inviting 200 people into her home — friends, neighbors, family members — and monitoring their heart rate and breathing while they checked their email. Roughly 80 percent of participants periodically held their breath or altered their breathing, she said. She named the phenomenon “email apnea” and described her findings in a widely read 2008 piece in The Huffington Post.
Ms. Stone has since expanded the concept and renamed it “screen apnea,” referring to the disruption of breathing many of us experience doing all kinds of tasks in front of a screen.
The issue has most likely worsened with our increased use of screens, said James Nestor, who examined the phenomenon in his 2020 book, “Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art.”

“You have 10 different screens open. Someone’s texting you, someone’s calling you, someone’s emailing you,” he said, adding that we have not evolved to be “constantly stimulated.”
Screen apnea is a manifestation of our body’s stress response, said Stephen Porges, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in the autonomic nervous system. When we’re faced with any kind of stimuli, our nervous system looks for signals to decipher whether or not it’s a threat, Dr. Porges said.
That focus and attention requires mental effort, which kicks off a chain of physiological changes including shallower breathing and a slowing of heart rate to “quiet” your body and divert resources to help you focus, he said. He gave the example of cats stalking their prey; often right before they attack, they will freeze and their breathing will become shallow. That, he said, is essentially what is happening when you get an email, text or Slack message: You freeze, read and come up with a plan of action.
The more unexpected a stimulus is — say, getting a text notification out of the blue — the more likely the body is to perceive it as a threat.
While these reflexes aren’t harmful on occasion, they become an issue if they’re switched on all day, every day, because it shifts “the nervous system into a chronic state of threat,” Dr. Porges said. Hours of shallow breathing can make you feel exhausted after a day of work, he said, even if that work isn’t particularly stressful.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The lack of movement that comes from sitting in front a screen might also be a contributor to screen apnea, said Dr. David Spiegel, director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford Medicine. Disrupted breathing is the result of “a combination of not just what you’re doing but what you’re not doing,” he said, adding that he noticed screen apnea among patients who worked high-stress jobs for long hours without getting much exercise or sleep.
There are a few simple practices you can adopt for better breathing habits, even in our increasingly screen-bound lives.
Set up breath reminders
A few gentle-sounding alerts throughout the day can remind you to check in on your breathing, Mr. Nestor said.
Ask yourself: Are you breathing through your mouth (often an indicator of shallow breath)? Are you breathing at all? The awareness helps you snap out of it, he said.
If you catch yourself breathing shallowly or not at all, try sighing audibly, Dr. Spiegel said. Studies suggest that can be a quick and easy way to reset breathing patterns. In a study published in January, Dr. Spiegel and his team found that while many breathing techniques are valuable, cyclic sighing — in which the exhale lasts longer than the inhale — is particularly effective for improving mood.

Try larger screens
Dr. Porges hypothesizes that the larger your screen, the less mentally taxing it can be. “As you narrow the visual field, you’re increasing the demand on your nervous system to exclude everything outside of it,” he said. Responding to messages on a desktop monitor often feels easier than responding on a phone, which “is a more intensely focused constriction of movement,” Dr. Spiegel said.
Make your breaks count
People will often step away from their computers for a break only to end up responding to messages on their phones, Dr. Porges said. He suggested carving out a few moments to do things that don’t require too much mental effort — like listening to music — so that your nervous system can switch from a state of focus and vigilance to one of relaxation.
Adding physical activity to your breaks — like walking in nature — is another way of restoring balance, Dr. Spiegel said. It’s a simple thing, he said, “that can help our bodies work better.”"

British antitrust officials said on Tuesday that they were reviewing a revised offer by Microsoft to win approval of its $69 billion merger with Activision Blizzard, an effort to clear the biggest remaining regulatory hurdle to the major video games deal.
To address the concerns of British regulators that the deal would stunt the development of a new area of gaming technology, Microsoft said it would transfer the cloud streaming licensing rights for all current and new Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher.

Why It Matters: The offer aims to address concerns over cloud gaming.
The deal that once faced long odds now appears to be on a path to approval. Britain is the last major holdout standing in the way of completing the blockbuster acquisition.
Microsoft’s revised offer is an effort to win over the country’s main antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, which said in April that it would to block the merger because of concerns about its impact on so-called cloud gaming, an emerging area of technology that lets people stream games on phones, tablets and other devices, potentially eliminating the need for consoles.
Under the new terms, Microsoft would give Ubisoft control over licensing deals for cloud gaming services for 15 years. This is aimed at preventing Microsoft from launching titles exclusively on its own cloud streaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming.
Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, called the offer “substantially different from what was put on the table previously,” yet cautioned that “this is not a green light.”
“Our goal has not changed,” she said in a statement. “Any future decision on this new deal will ensure that the growing cloud gaming market continues to benefit from open and effective competition driving innovation and choice.”
Background: Microsoft has overcome other objections to the deal.
After announcing its intension to buy Activision in January 2022, Microsoft has faced a gantlet of scrutiny, as the deal has become a test of whether regulators around the world would approve a tech megamerger amid concerns about the industry’s power. Rivals such as Sony lobbied for it to be blocked.
The acquisition faced an uphill climb after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block it in December and the British authorities said they would likewise try to stop the acquisition.
But Microsoft scored a major victory in May when the European Union approved the deal. And in July, a U.S. federal judge ruled against the F.T.C.’s efforts to slow down the deal, leaving only the British authorities as a major obstacle to clear.
What’s Next: A decision is expected by October.
The British regulator said it would issue a decision by Oct. 18, the date that Microsoft has set as a deadline to complete its deal with Activision."
2023-08-23,"In a sign that the tech industry’s next big boom is picking up steam, Nvidia on Wednesday predicted rapid growth in the already rabid demand for the chips it makes to build artificial intelligence systems.
The Silicon Valley company’s products, called graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to create the vast majority of A.I. systems, including the popular ChatGPT chatbot. Tech companies ranging from start-ups to the industry’s giants are fighting to get their hands on them.
Nvidia said heavy demand from cloud computing services and other customers for chips to power A.I. systems caused revenue for its second quarter, which ended in July, to jump 101 percent from a year earlier, to $13.5 billion, while profit surged more than ninefold to nearly $6.2 billion.
That was even better than what Nvidia had projected in late May, when its $11 billion revenue estimate for the quarter stunned Wall Street and helped push Nvidia’s market value above $1 trillion for the first time.

Nvidia’s prediction and lofty market cap became a symbol for the growing exuberance surrounding A.I., which is transforming many computing systems and the way they are programmed. They also sharply raised the interest in what Nvidia might say the next time about chip demand for its current quarter, which ends in October.
Nvidia projected third-quarter sales of $16 billion, nearly triple the level a year ago and $3.7 billion more than analysts’ average expectations of around $12.3 billion.
The financial performance of chip makers is often considered a harbinger for the rest of the tech industry, and Nvidia’s strong results could reignite enthusiasm for tech stocks on Wall Street. Other tech companies like Google and Microsoft are spending billions and making little on A.I., but Nvidia is cashing in.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia’s A.I. technology to every industry. “The number of applications is just quite spectacular,” he said in an interview after a conference call with analysts. “Every single data center will be accelerated.”
Nvidia’s share price was up more than 9 percent in after-hours trading.
Until recently, Nvidia got the biggest share of its revenue from sales of GPUs for rendering images in video games. But A.I. researchers started using those chips in 2012 for tasks such as machine learning, a trend that Nvidia exploited over the years by adding enhancements to its GPUs and many pieces of software to reduce labor for A.I. programmers.

Chip sales for data centers, where most A.I. training is accomplished, are now the company’s biggest business. Revenue from that business grew 171 percent to $10.3 billion in the second period, Nvidia said.
Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said the rush to add generative A.I. capability has become a fundamental imperative to corporate chiefs and boards of directors. Nvidia’s only limitation at the moment, he said, is its struggle to supply enough chips — a gap that may create opportunities for major chip companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and start-ups such as Groq.
Nvidia’s roaring sales contrasted sharply with the fortunes of some of its chip industry peers, which have been hurt by soft demand for personal computers and data center servers used for general-purpose tasks. Intel said in late July that second-quarter revenue fell 15 percent, though the results were better than Wall Street had expected. Revenue at Advanced Micro Devices fell 18 percent in the same period.
Some analysts believe that spending on A.I.-specific hardware, such as Nvidia’s chips and systems that use them, is drawing money away from spending on other data center infrastructure. IDC, a market research firm, estimates that cloud services will increase their spending on server systems for A.I. by 68 percent over the next five years.
While Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM and others have also produced A.I. chips, Nvidia today accounts for more than 70 percent of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models, according to the research firm Omdia.

Demand is particularly heavy for the H100, a new GPU made by Nvidia for A.I. applications, which began shipping in September. Large and small companies have been scrambling to find supplies of the chips, which are fabricated in an advanced production process and require equally sophisticated packaging that combines GPUs with special memory chips.
Nvidia’s ability to increase deliveries of the H100 is largely linked to actions by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which handles the packaging as well as fabricating the GPUs.
Industry executives expect the shortage of H100s to extend throughout 2024, a problem for A.I. start-ups and cloud services hoping to sell computing services that exploit the new GPUs.
Mr. Huang said the company was working diligently with its production partners to get more chips to market, including working with other companies to supplement TSMC’s packaging capability. “Supply will substantially increase the rest of this year and next year,” he said."
2023-08-24,"As increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems with the potential to reshape society come online, many experts, lawmakers and even executives of top A.I. companies want the U.S. government to regulate the technology, and fast.
“We should move quickly,” Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, which launched an A.I.-powered version of its search engine this year, said in May. “There’s no time for waste or delay,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has said. “Let’s get ahead of this,” said Senator Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican.
Yet history suggests that comprehensive federal regulation of advanced A.I. systems probably won’t happen soon. Congress and federal agencies have often taken decades to enact rules governing revolutionary technologies, from electricity to cars. “The general pattern is it takes a while,” said Matthew Mittelsteadt, a technologist who studies A.I. at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.
A Long Time to Regulate
It has often taken decades after the advent of a technology for Congress to pass a major law to regulate it.

In the 1800s, it took Congress more than half a century after the introduction of the first public, steam-powered train to give the government the power to set price rules for railroads, the first U.S. industry subject to federal regulation. In the 20th century, the bureaucracy slowly expanded to regulate radio, television and other technologies. And in the 21st century, lawmakers have struggled to safeguard digital data privacy.

It’s possible that policymakers will defy history.

2023-08-25,"The stock market’s monthslong rally stumbled this month. The thrill of seeing investment gains, with metronomic regularity, is gone.
I miss that feeling: scanning my investments and knowing in advance that the numbers will be larger than they were the last time I looked. But, in an important way, the market’s summer setbacks have been long awaited, and they come as something of a relief.
Don’t misunderstand. It’s not that I want to see the rising stock market stop in its tracks. I’d prefer an endless move upward, making me, and everyone else, richer.
But that’s a fantasy. In the real world, upward stock market thrusts are always temporary. When stocks rise too quickly, they inevitably fall and sometimes crash. The stock market is essentially volatile, and for every big winner, dozens of casualties occur.

That’s why, as a second-best alternative, I hope for something more modest: a choppy market that experiences periodic downturns, but one that trends upward for very long periods.
The Stock Market’s Movements
That is, in fact, a rough description of what the stock market has been like for the past 25 years, according to statistics provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. In that period, the S&P 500 has returned 552.31 percent, or 7.8 percent, annualized, but to garner those handsome returns, an investor would have had to sit tight through countless downturns.
While August has so far been a negative month for the stock market, there have been no major downturns this year. Through July, the S&P 500 rose for five consecutive months. Just seven big tech stocks — Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Tesla and Alphabet (Google) — accounted for more than two-thirds of the S&P 500’s gains.
This year, through July, the S&P 500 rose 19.5 percent, for a total return, including dividends, of 20.7 percent. Those were splendid numbers, but the market had been rising so rapidly on such a narrow base that it seemed to me that it was setting itself up for a fall.
What’s more, from a market bottom on Oct. 11, 2022, through July, the S&P 500 gained 27.9 percent, for a total return of 29.6 percent including dividends. In June, when the market had gained 20 percent from its October low, many commentators declared that the bear market that started on Jan. 3, 2022, was over, and that a new bull market had begun.

Mr. Silverblatt did not agree, because the market had not returned to its peak of Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&P 500 stood at 4,796.56, almost 9 percent above its current level. By his definition, it won’t be clear that the S&P 500 is in a bull market until it climbs back to that level. Categorizing the market this way, as either bull or bear, is a straightforward retrospective judgment, not an assertion of the market’s future direction, which no one can forecast accurately.
This cautious way of thinking about the market is one I favor.
I’m not sure what the rally that started in October will amount to, but based on history, the summer swoon could be a good thing.
The stock market’s problems in August stem, at least partly, from shifts in the fixed-income markets: a sharp rise in short-term interest rates underway since the start of 2022, and a surge in long-term rates since June.
The Lure of Fixed Income
Thanks to the rise in short-term rates, it’s possible to get a great return on cash. Money market funds provide yields well above 5 percent.
Bond yields have risen this summer, and they are now high enough to make bonds, with their safer profiles, an attractive alternative to stocks. And many factors driving up yields are negative for stocks, too.

Briefly put, short-term rates — those embodied in money-market funds as well as credit cards — are a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve’s campaign to reduce inflation. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy, mainly by raising the short-term rates it controls, the best known being the federal funds rate.
On Friday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said that until there is conclusive evidence that inflation has been tamed, the central bank will maintain these rate levels or take them higher.
Longer-term interest rates — those for bonds and mortgages — have been rising, too. But these rates are complicated. They are set in the vast bond market.
By bidding down bond prices and raising yields (prices and yields move in opposite directions, as a matter of basic bond-market math), traders have indicated that they consider the economy to be stronger and inflation to be more persistent than had been expected a few months ago. The downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency also contributed to the run-up in rates on Treasury securities. And because Treasuries serve as benchmarks for virtually every other bond and, indeed, for every other investment in the global economy, higher rates have made stocks less appealing in comparison.
In addition, the balance of supply and demand in the bond market has been tilting in a way that is contributing to higher rates. The Treasury has been auctioning an unusually large amount of debt, bulking up its resources after the brinkmanship of the debt ceiling crisis this spring. That increase in the supply of Treasuries coincides with a reduction in demand from several important sources: The Federal Reserve is no longer purchasing bonds, while the appetite for Treasuries from Japan and China has begun to flag, too.

All these factors have contributed to the run-up in yields, and they are weighing on stocks.
Reading the Economy
Furthermore, one core issue assessed by bond buyers — the prospects for economic growth or recession in the United States and elsewhere around the world — has obsessed stock traders, too. But, at the moment, the U.S. economy is extraordinarily difficult to decipher.
Higher interest rates might have been expected to slow down the economy by now, or throw it into recession. A waning of economic growth in China might also be expected to be a drag on the U.S. economy.
But the U.S. economy and the job market, in particular, have been remarkably resilient, and consumer spending remains strong. As a consequence, corporate earnings in many sectors have exceeded Wall Street’s muted expectations. If a recession were to develop, however, the outlook would be much worse.
All that said, there are many reasons for optimism. In July, the market rally broadened substantially, with the stocks of smaller companies outperforming the giants, and every domestic sector posting gains. It was just what a stock investor would want to see in a market with sustainable upward momentum.
Even the surge in interest rates could turn out to be innocuous. After all, it has returned rates to a level deemed healthy in previous economic cycles. Since January 1962, 10-year Treasury yields have averaged 4.2 percent — not far from where they are now. The appropriate level for interest rates for the rest of this decade is being debated at the Fed and among a broad range of economists.

In short, uncertainty about inflation and the Fed’s response to it are well-founded. The paths of the markets and the economy may meander inconclusively for a while, thwarting anyone who wants to place a decisive bet one way or another.
But it’s a complicated world. Binary distinctions like bull market and bear market reduce complexity to simple notions that investors can grab onto. But I think these, in particular, are the wrong notions.
The bull and bear market labels imply future action.
In a bull market, stocks, for the most part, rise. In a bear market, more often than not, they fall. You might assume that you should avoid bear markets and welcome bull markets. But that’s not a wise course for long-term investors, who are better off buying when prices are low and selling only at moments of their own choosing.
I’m bullish about the stock market for the long haul. But that’s very different from believing that we are in a bull market or a bear right now. I just don’t know and don’t really care.
Instead, I’m investing for the long run, without trying to time market movements or pick individual stocks or bonds. I hold a piece of the world’s entire stock and bond markets — not just the S&P 500 — through low-cost, broadly diversified index funds, and have been hanging in for decades.

Hurricane Idalia has strengthened to a Category 3 storm, with insurance analysts fearing it could do billions in damage.

A stormy forecast for insurance
Hurricane Idalia strengthened to a Category 3 storm on Wednesday morning, packing soaking rains and destructive winds of up to 125 miles per hour, as it lumbers toward the Florida coastline. Officials along Florida’s Gulf Coast and in Georgia and the Carolinas have issued emergency warnings, as the region braces for yet another “multibillion-dollar insurance industry event.”
Last September, Hurricane Ian, a Category 4 storm, slammed into Florida, inflicting nearly $100 billion in damage. Such disasters are becoming more common — and more costly — each year, sending insurance costs soaring for homeowners and businesses.
Insurance companies are still reeling from Ian. Some firms doubt they can continue to cope with such superstorms, while others have limited their business in the state. One of their big complaints: State regulations prevent them from raising prices for customers, they say, forcing them to say no to new policies.
Florida’s woes reflect a nationwide problem, one that is expected to intensify as climate change unleashes more extreme weather events. The Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, estimates that property and casualty insurers in the state have had cumulative underwriting losses of more than $1 billion for the last three years.

The picture is bleak elsewhere, too:
State Farm, the country’s largest insurance provider, said it would stop selling homeowners’ coverage in California, a state that has been battered by wildfires in recent years. Allstate also said it had stopped selling new home and commercial policies there, citing worsening climate risks and rising building costs.
American International Group plans to curb home insurance sales in New York, Delaware, Florida, Colorado, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, after restricting new business in California.
Not everyone views these markets as hopeless. Florida’s insurance regulator just approved Orion180 as a new insurer for the state. “We view Florida as an attractive insurance market for profitable growth over the long term,” said Kenneth Gregg, the company’s founder and C.E.O. And Berkshire Hathaway has bet big on Florida’s reinsurance market this year.
One possible enticement: Premiums in the state have spiked, with the average Florida homeowner now paying $6,000 a year. (However, those rising premiums have also brought down property values, pushing more property owners to forego coverage.)
A so-called “protection gap” seems likely to grow. Last year, insurance covered just 60 percent of the $165 billion in total economic losses from climate-related disasters in the U.S. That widening gap is becoming a major concern for federal regulators, who worry it leaves big swaths of American homeowners and businesses vulnerable to the next superstorm.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
A drop in job openings may hearten the Fed. The Labor Department reported that there were 8.8 million job openings in July, the lowest level since March 2021. Economists said that would likely be interpreted as a good sign by the Fed, which will weigh new moves on interest rate policy at a meeting next month; the central bank will also factor in jobs data scheduled for release on Friday.

The White House names a first batch of drugs set for Medicare price negotiations. Officials unveiled the long-awaited list of 10 medicines, which will be subject to a landmark new program meant to reduce costs for Medicare. Drugmakers have pushed back against the plan, including in court, and Republicans have criticized the initiative as government overreach.
Military leaders seize power in oil-rich Gabon. Officers claiming to represent the major security forces of the African country said they were canceling the results of last weekend’s election, less than an hour after the incumbent president won a third term. A successful coup would mark at least the ninth military takeover in Western and Central Africa in the last three years.
CNN is expected to name its next leader imminently. Executives at Warner Bros. Discovery, the news network’s parent company, have selected Mark Thompson, a former C.E.O. of The New York Times and head of the BBC, for the post, according to The Times. The pick is meant to restore order at CNN, which has been rattled by turmoil, including the ouster of its last chief, Chris Licht.

The on-the-ground view of Raimondo’s trip to China
Wednesday was the last day of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo’s visit to China, where she has sought to promote trade between the two superpowers while holding firm on technology export limits imposed in the name of American national security.

The Times’s Ana Swanson, who covers trade and international economics and has been traveling with Raimondo, answered DealBook’s questions about the trip — while zipping along at 215 miles per hour on a train from Beijing to Shanghai.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
What has the mood been like, given the current tensions between Washington and Beijing?
The atmosphere is cautious but fairly warm. It seems like both sides are pleased to be talking again, after a very rocky period for U.S.-China relations during “balloongate.” So there is somewhat of a sense of a thaw, but also recognition of how many difficult issues there are in the relationship, and that often U.S. and Chinese interests will fundamentally conflict.
How is Raimondo balancing business interests and national security during her conversations with Chinese officials?
Raimondo has focused on promoting business ties that have nothing to do with national security — like skin care products, amusement parks and group tourism — but employed tough rhetoric about the technology controls and national security.
She didn’t talk as much about the huge number of products that fall somewhere in the middle: things like cars, steel and solar panels that are strategically important to the United States. Here, she has a more complicated mandate. Some U.S. businesses thrive on trade with China, while others are harmed or undercut by Chinese practices.

What, if anything, will this change about the U.S. relationship with China going forward?
Some are describing this as a turning point for the U.S.-China relationship. But Raimondo said on Tuesday that the direction of the relationship will depend on how much China follows through on things like improving its treatment of American companies. “Actions speak louder than words,” she said.
In other China news: The embattled homebuilder Country Garden plans to raise $34 million by selling new shares as it teeters on the brink of default. And rivals of Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination are following his lead in taking even tougher stances on trade with China.
“I hope they succeed, but this just seems like a lot of tech guys with a lot of money and a ton of hubris diving into another business that they can’t possibly understand.”

Could Bitcoin go mainstream for investors?
Bitcoin surged as much as 7 percent on Tuesday on hopes that a favorable federal court ruling could usher in the crypto industry’s long-held dream of a new mainstream investment product tied to the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin was trading just below $27,500 on Wednesday morning, after soaring past $28,000 on Tuesday, its highest level in two weeks. Crypto bulls bought it up after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, should be allowed to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that could eventually trade on a traditional stock market.
Image
It’s a blow to the S.E.C., which has taken a hard line on the industry and on applications for crypto investment products, especially since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX last year.
That said, the agency has approved Bitcoin-focused funds — but only those centered on futures that track price fluctuations in the cryptocurrency, starting in 2021. The agency has denied numerous requests to introduce an E.T.F. holding Bitcoin itself, arguing that the market for Bitcoin is subject to fraud and manipulation, leaving investors vulnerable.
In its ruling, the appeals court found the S.E.C.’s track record on such approvals “arbitrary and capricious.”
The crypto industry has waited a decade for this. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of the crypto exchange Gemini, first proposed such a Bitcoin fund in 2013. Since then, Wall Street stalwarts like BlackRock and Fidelity have made similar unsuccessful applications.

Grayscale’s case against the S.E.C. was closely watched by crypto executives: Approval would mean that investors could buy shares in a Bitcoin fund rather than hold the digital asset itself.
But the dream will be deferred at least a little longer. The agency has 45 days to request a review of the ruling, and an S.E.C. spokesman said it was weighing its next steps.

UBS executives had 29 billion reasons to celebrate the Swiss bank’s latest quarterly results.

The magic of “badwill”
When UBS agreed to buy its archrival, Credit Suisse, for a little over $3 billion this spring at the Swiss government’s behest, analysts and investors said that price represented a steep discount. UBS’s latest financial results reflect just how much of a steal it was.
Today, the bank reported a $29 billion profit — yes, you read that right — for the second quarter, the biggest quarterly profit in banking history. But that paper gain belies the challenges that UBS faces as it moves to complete the largest takeover of a bank since the 2008 financial crisis.
UBS’s huge profit arises from “badwill,” an accounting phenomenon where a company buys an asset for less than it’s worth, leading to a noncash gain that essentially recognizes the actual value of the asset. (It’s also known as “negative goodwill.”) UBS reported that its underlying profit for the quarter was just $1.1 billion.
Image
A wave of bank rescue deals this year has led to pumped-up profits for acquirers. Second-quarter profits at JPMorgan Chase jumped 67 percent in large part because of its takeover of First Republic, while First Citizens enjoyed a 3,500 percent gain in first-quarter profit after buying Silicon Valley Bank at a steep discount.

But UBS has more work to do, with the bank estimating that the Credit Suisse acquisition will be largely completed by 2026. Among its biggest tasks is consolidating its former rival’s domestic bank with its own, despite concerns that the move will undercut competition in Swiss retail banking.
Uniting the two will lead to some 3,000 job losses in the country, fulfilling fears among politicians and voters. But UBS defended its decision today, saying, “Our analysis clearly shows that full integration is the best outcome for UBS, our stakeholders and the Swiss economy.”
Meanwhile, Credit Suisse’s own results — including a pretax loss of 4.3 billion Swiss Francs ($4.9 billion) in the quarter, tied to customer withdrawals and struggles in investment banking — suggest that UBS still has big hurdles to overcome in absorbing the business.
For now, UBS shareholders appear happy, especially with the badwill gain showing just how much the bank benefited from rescuing its rival. (UBS manages about $5 trillion in client assets following the deal.) Shares in the bank were up over 5 percent today, at 23.42 Swiss francs ($26.57), and now trade at their highest level since the summer of 2008.

Donald Trump is accused of vastly overinflating his properties’ values. Attorney General Letitia James of New York said in a court filing that the former president fraudulently pumped up the value of his holdings for years, boosting his net worth by up to $2.2 billion. Lawyers for Trump said the case, one of many he faces in federal and state courts, should be dismissed.
Microsoft moves to unbundle its Teams app in Europe. The tech giant hopes that offering lower-cost versions of its productivity software packages that don’t include the communications program will assuage E.U. regulators who opened an antitrust investigation into the matter last month. Whether that will be enough is unclear: A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined to comment on whether the move satisfied regulators’ concerns.

What to watch in tomorrow’s jobs report
The S&P 500 is riding a four-day winning streak on hopes that the Fed is done raising interest rates. That optimistic view will be tested tomorrow morning when the Labor Department releases its nonfarm payrolls report for August.
Economists polled by Reuters estimate that employers added 170,000 jobs in August, which would be the smallest monthly increase since December 2020. But investors would likely greet a modest slowdown — along with evidence that wages are moderating — favorably.
Image
For much of the year, markets have reacted positively to any piece of data showing that the Fed’s policy of raising its prime lending rate was cooling the red-hot labor market and, in turn, helping to lower inflation.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The labor data already released this week has cheered investors. Yesterday’s ADP private payroll report for August showed the slowest job growth in five months. That followed a Labor Department data release on Tuesday that revealed a steep drop in job openings. “The labor market is cooling and is taking pressure off policymakers concerned with a second wave of inflation,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, a research firm, wrote in a note yesterday, pointing to the ADP data.
The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady at its meeting next month. And the futures market yesterday was pricing in a 44 percent chance of the Fed raising rates at its November policy meeting — a stark drop from the 67 percent odds traders were placing at the beginning of the week. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, warned last week that central bankers do not consider their inflation fight to be over yet, making Friday’s jobs numbers pivotal.
In other labor news, the Biden administration yesterday proposed an increase in the cutoff for salaried workers who can receive overtime, making millions more workers eligible for time-and-a-half pay if they work more than 40 hours a week.
“I’ve seen all kinds of weird things with people ahead, they fall behind, they disappear. And it’s just way too early to have some conclusion that two people that the country doesn’t want are going to be the logical outcomes.”
— Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder of Blackstone, speaking to Puck about the possibility of a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024 despite both candidates polling poorly among voters. Schwarzman, a major Republican donor who has turned his back on Trump, said another candidate could yet claim the G.O.P. nomination.
DeSantis’s flip-flopping on federal aid
Hurricane Idalia has been downgraded to a tropical storm and is moving north after battering Florida, leaving residents counting the costs of the devastation and the insurance industry predicting billions of dollars in claims. But the storm’s impact also shines a light on the complicated relationship between Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican presidential contender, and the federal government, which typically spends big to help in such cleanups.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Biden administration has pledged support. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has about $3.4 billion in its disaster relief fund to deal with the fallout of the Maui wildfires and Idalia. Deanne Criswell, head of the agency, told reporters yesterday that DeSantis had “no unmet needs,” before heading to Florida. President Biden said that he had called DeSantis to say he had approved an emergency declaration that the governor requested, adding, “I think he trusts my judgment and my desire to help.”
But DeSantis hasn’t always backed the spending of federal funds for disaster relief. When he was a congressman in 2013, he rejected assistance for victims of Hurricane Sandy in New York. As governor of Florida, however, he has sought aid, and during Hurricane Ian last year he paused his political feuding with Biden. DeSantis also condemned F.E.M.A. for denying a request for funds to rebuild homes after Ian.
DeSantis is already rejecting federal funds in other ways. Florida is eligible for about $350 million in green incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, but the governor has refused the money. Republican governors in South Dakota and Iowa, along with Kentucky’s Democratic governor, are turning down smaller sums.
But DeSantis’s broader rejection suggests that taking a stance on I.R.A. money could become a talking point in the race to decide the Republican presidential candidate. And that could ultimately undermine President Biden’s efforts to promote his environmental policies on the 2024 campaign trail while climate change makes emergencies like Idalia increasingly common.

2023-09-01,"In 2021, Apple was embroiled in controversy over a plan to scan iPhones for child sexual abuse materials. Privacy experts warned that governments could abuse the system, and the backlash was so severe that Apple eventually abandoned the plan.
Two years later, Apple is facing criticism from child safety crusaders and activist investors who are calling on the company to do more to protect children from online abuse.
A child advocacy group, the Heat Initiative, has raised $2 million for a new national advertising campaign calling on Apple to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse materials from iCloud, its cloud storage platform.
Next week, the group will release digital advertisements on websites popular with policymakers in Washington, such as Politico. It will also put up posters across San Francisco and New York that say: “Child sexual abuse material is stored on iCloud. Apple allows it.”
ADVERTISEMENT

The criticism speaks to a predicament that has dogged Apple for years. The company has made protecting privacy a central part of its iPhone pitch to consumers. But that promise of security has helped make its services and devices, two billion of which are in use, useful tools for sharing child sexual abuse imagery.
The company is caught between child safety groups, which want it to do more to stop the spread of such materials, and privacy experts, who want it to maintain the promise of secure devices.

A group of two dozen investors with nearly $1 trillion in assets under management have also called on Apple to publicly report the number of abusive images that it catches across its devices and services.
Two investors — Degroof Petercam, a Belgian asset manager, and Christian Brothers Investment Services, a Catholic investment firm — will submit a shareholder proposal this month that would require Apple to provide a detailed report on how effective its safety tools were at protecting children.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Apple seems stuck between privacy and action,” said Matthew Welch, an investment specialist at Degroof Petercam. “We thought a proposal would wake up management and get them to take this more seriously.”
Apple has been quick to respond to child safety advocates. In early August, its privacy executives met with the group of investors, Mr. Welch said. Then, on Thursday, the company responded to an email from the Heat Initiative with a letter that defended its decision not to scan iCloud. It shared the correspondence with Wired, a technology publication.
In Apple’s letter, Erik Neuenschwander, the director for user privacy and child safety, said the company had concluded that “it was not practically possible” to scan iCloud photos without “imperiling the security and privacy of our users.”
“Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems,” Mr. Neuenschwander said.
Apple, he added, has created a new default feature for all child accounts that intervenes with a warning if they receive or try to send nude images. It’s designed to prevent the creation of new child sexual abuse material and limit the risk of predators coercing and blackmailing children for money or nude images. It has made those tools available to app developers as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In 2021, Apple said it would use technology called image hashes to spot abusive material on iPhones and in iCloud.
But the company failed to communicate that plan broadly with privacy experts, intensifying their skepticism and fueling concern that governments could abuse the technology, said Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory at the Cyber Policy Center, who opposed the idea.
Last year, the company discreetly abandoned its plan to scan iCloud, catching child safety groups by surprise.
Apple has won praise from both privacy and child safety groups for its efforts to blunt the creation of new nude images on iMessage and other services. But Mr. Stamos, who applauded the company’s decision not to scan iPhones, said it could do more to stop people from sharing problematic images in the cloud.
“You can have privacy if you store something for yourself, but if you share something with someone else, you don’t get the same privacy,” Mr. Stamos said.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Governments around the world are putting pressure on Apple to take action. Last year, eSafety Commissioner in Australia issued a report criticizing Apple and Microsoft for failing to do more to proactively police their services for abusive material.
In the United States, Apple made 160 reports in 2021 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally designated clearinghouse for abusive material. Google made 875,783 reports, while Facebook made 22 million. These reports do not always reflect truly abusive material; some parents have had their Google accounts suspended and have been reported to the police for images of their children that were not criminal in nature.
The Heat Initiative timed its campaign ahead of Apple’s annual iPhone unveiling, which is scheduled for Sept. 12. The campaign is being led by Sarah Gardner, who was previously the vice president for external affairs at Thorn, a nonprofit founded by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore to combat child sexual abuse online. Ms. Gardner raised money from a number of child safety supporters, including the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Oak Foundation.
The group has built a website that documents law enforcement cases where iCloud has been named. The list will include child pornography charges brought against a 55-year-old in New York who had more than 200 images stored in iCloud.
Ms. Gardner said the Heat Initiative planned to target advertising throughout the fall in areas where Apple customers and employees would encounter it. “The goal is to continue to run the tactics until Apple changes its policy,” Ms. Gardner said.

A recession seems remote, but market jitters persist
For the third time in three months, economists at Goldman Sachs have lowered the odds of a recession and now put the risk of a downturn in the United States at 15 percent. Yet despite the upbeat outlook, which follows other votes of confidence from Wall Street in recent weeks, global stocks and U.S. futures are in the red on Tuesday morning as inflation fears persist.
The strong labor market is propping up U.S. households. “Real disposable income looks set to reaccelerate in 2024 on the back of continued solid job growth and rising real wages,” Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, wrote in a client note. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that wage gains had cooled in August, but real wages, adjusted for inflation, are trending higher.
Goldman is far more bullish than others. In March, the bank raised its recession odds to 35 percent in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and worries that contagion could hurt other lenders. But fears of a bank-led downturn have all but disappeared. Still, a Bloomberg survey of economists puts the likelihood of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months at 60 percent.
Voters aren’t feeling so confident either. Poll numbers released on Monday by The Wall Street Journal showed that President Biden’s popularity is still sagging, partly because of his track record on the economy. (Voters also say he’s too old to run for re-election.) It’s the latest indication that the White House’s summer P.R. offensive, playing up the gains reaped from Bidenomics, is not resonating with Americans.
Investors aren’t feeling bullish. After last week’s rally, the S&P 500 looks set to start the week on a down note, as rising oil prices drive inflation concerns. Another potential storm cloud: Investors are questioning whether the benchmark index can hold onto its 18 percent year-to-date gains if inflation rises this autumn.
Brent crude oil hit a high for the year on Monday. Markets are bracing for the OPEC+ cartel, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, to announce this week that it will continue to pull back on production. Rising energy prices could force central banks to stay hawkish on interest rates.

2023-09-06,"Silicon Valley isn’t just consumed by youth; often, it’s blinded.
Look at Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg created the social network for college students, but Facebook has been struggling to hang on to young users for more than a decade; usage by people over 25 has steadily grown over that time, and along with YouTube, Facebook has become the internet’s most popular social network among people over 50. This wouldn’t seem terrible for a company that makes money from advertising, as Facebook does. After all, older people are the future of business: According to a recent analysis by AARP, people over 50 now account for more than half of the world’s consumer spending, and their share is projected to grow to 60 percent by 2050.
So is Zuckerberg rejoicing that he owns the preferred online destination of the planet’s wealthiest and fastest-growing consumer demographic, tomorrow’s whales of consumerist desire?
He is not. Instead he seems embarrassed by it. Documents leaked by a whistle-blower in 2021 showed Facebook product managers obsessed with reversing the app’s unpopularity with teens and young adults. In an earnings call with shareholders that year, Zuckerberg promised to refocus the company toward improving its services for young adults “rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people.” Right — why optimize for a larger number of wealthier people when you can be cool with the kids?
This is how it goes in Silicon Valley’s youth bubble. From Meta to Snap to TikTok, the tech industry’s picture of its customers resembles that of the famously exclusionary fruity cereal: Silly rabbit, tech is for kids! Wunderkind founders are revered here, growing old is considered a disease in need of a cure, and ageism is barely concealed. In 2007, a year before he became, at 23, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, Zuckerberg said the quiet part out loud. “Young people,” he told an audience at Stanford, “are just smarter.”

They aren’t, actually. The tech industry’s hostility to aging “continues to violate common sense,” Joseph Coughlin, the director of M.I.T.’s AgeLab, told me. His lab conducts research on how an aging population is changing business. He said that companies in the auto industry, financial services, retail and other sectors are coming around to the emerging opportunities of the “longevity economy,” the 1.6 billion people around the world who will be 65 or older by the year 2050.
Silicon Valley remains a glaring exception. America’s tech giants are among the world’s largest and most innovative businesses; if they took a more open-minded approach to aging — if they considered solving the problems of older customers as eagerly as they chased teen fads — they could establish a model for aging in a tech-besotted world. Through advances focused on health care, home assistance, transportation, robotics and artificial intelligence, technology will be crucial to address the problems emerging from demographic imbalance. If there are not enough younger people to care for and cater to the needs of the old, we will increasingly lean on tech to add convenience, independence and perhaps even companionship to our lengthening sunset years."

2023-09-09,"Jump to: Tricky Clues | Today’s Theme
SUNDAY PUZZLE — Adam Wagner, of Oakland, is a creative lead at Patreon, a monetization platform for content creators. This is his 16th crossword for The New York Times, and his fifth Sunday grid. Mr. Wagner is part of a large community of Bay Area puzzlemakers. He speculates that the overlap between tech and crossword construction may be the reason for the concentration.
There’s also a lot of traffic out there, right? This eye-catching visual theme presents a set of obstacles that made me think of the self-driving cars in San Francisco that keep popping up in the news. (Shows how auto-centric I am; don’t miss the constructor notes below, if you also mentally drove through this solve.)
Today’s Theme
There are five pairs of across entries in the puzzle that comprise this theme, all noticeable for their creative decorations. 22-, 45-, 68-, 88- and 112-Across each sport a series of boxes with diagonal yellow slashes, which I reflexively recognized as barricades, the temporary type that are set to block part of a highway, for instance. 27-, 52-, 74-, 94- and 117-Across are all made completely of gray boxes; each of those entries runs one row below a yellow-and-white “barricade,” so it’s pretty clear that there is a relationship between the two entries even before you start looking at the puzzle’s clues. This is important because these clues would be very confusing without context.
Each of the clues with the barricade within has two elements, one of which is struck out. For example, 88-Across is “P̶h̶o̶t̶o̶g̶r̶a̶p̶h̶e̶r̶’s̶ s̶e̶t̶t̶i̶n̶g ̶ DETOUR: Come in handy.” 45-Across is “H̶o̶m̶e̶l̶a̶n̶d̶ s̶e̶c̶u̶r̶i̶t̶y̶ c̶o̶n̶c̶e̶r̶n̶s̶ DETOUR: Computer port inserts.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Solve one of these entries, though, and you’ll find that the crossed-out clue actually applies. 88-Across is FILM SPEED; the letters “M-S-P-E” fall within the zone of the yellow-slashed barricade. 45-Across is US BORDERS, which are “Homeland security concerns.”
Now, check out the clues for the second set of entries: Each of them, from 27- to 117-Across, is just “DETOUR” #1 through #5. This gives confirmation that they are related, sure, but not of much assistance otherwise.
Crossing letters to the rescue, then. 94-Across, “DETOUR #4,” sits directly beneath the “M-S-P-E” in FILM SPEED, and solves to LANE. Check 88-Across one more time, and notice that second element, “Come in handy.” If you detour from M-S-P-E to L-A-N-E, you get a whole new term: FILL A NEED. How helpful! To get from the first, struck-through element in the main clue to the second part, take a turn, use the letters in each connected DETOUR entry, and get back to the main drag.
That means that 45-Across, US BORDERS, needs to reroute to DRIVE at 52-Across, ”DETOUR #2,” to get USB DRIVES, or “Computer port inserts.”
Even though you need to completely deduce the “DETOUR” clues, once you know that they are all passageways, they’re doable. I think the first example at 22- and 27-Across might be the toughest, and it’s also my favorite. “D̶i̶c̶k̶e̶n̶s̶ c̶l̶e̶r̶k̶ DETOUR: Theatrical success” solves to BOB CRATCHIT, from “A Christmas Carol,” and then detours to BROADWAY HIT.

25A. This admiring term — describing “Formidable-but-awesome behavior” — is a debut: BADASSERY. There have been several BADASSes in crosswords past, however.
58A. “Things settled over drinks” had to involve a bill, I figured, so I wasn’t expecting a BAR BET. (Admittedly, the stake of the BET could be the night’s tab.)
75A. Drink enough whiskey and make enough bad BAR BETs and you might embody the pun in this clue, “Lose one’s balance?”. The answer is GO BROKE, unfortunately.
108A. We’re word people, so we can deduce this term for “Golden” from the Latin (and the precious metal’s chemical symbol): It’s AUREATE.
4D. I loved this riddle: “Hunt-and-peck types?” aren’t hovering over a keyboard, they’re soaring over the fields, as BIRDS OF PREY do.

70D. Enthusiasts of neat inside activities from the 2010s on may know these “Motion-sensing Microsoft gaming devices,” otherwise known as XBOX KINECTS — a nice, scrabbly entry.
72D. On the other hand, fans of messy outdoor high jinks will get this one: the “Backyard toy that attaches to a hose” is a SLIP N SLIDE, which was prototyped with a big roll of Naugahyde back in 1960, and is still manufactured.
Constructor Notes
“But Adam!” you protest, “This isn’t a tight set! ROADWAY, DRIVE, LANE, STREET, and … PATH? You can’t drive on a PATH!” Oh you poor, car brained soul. Who said anything about driving? This theme is about bike detours! You can peddle that autonormative thinking someplace else … I’ll just be here pedaling.
Stray thoughts:
The dream was to put the detours above their answers, capped off with a TAKE THE HIGH ROAD revealer. But I couldn’t pass up on BOB CRATCHIT / B[ROADWAY] HIT, so I scrapped the revealer to avoid the ROADWAY/ROAD dupe.
I also had to toss PICKET LINE/PICK [A VENUE] because the detour never reconnects with the main entry. I may or may not have noticed this only after constructing an entire grid around it.
My sister-in-law got me a hat with a portmanteau of 71A and 106D on it. I’m obsessed with it.
Fave clues of mine are 4D and 75A. Fave editorial additions are 28A, 24D, and 97A.
Glad to include some autobiographical clues on 61D (my wife and I are every couple on this show), 120A, 118A, and 110A (I’m a terrible liar, but I love getting demolished at this game).
Hope you enjoyed!

2023-09-11,"The Justice Department argues in a federal antitrust suit that Google is a dominant tech company that has abused its market power to bully industry partners, protect its monopoly and thwart competition.
That has a familiar ring. As U.S. et al. v. Google goes to trial this week, the echoes of the landmark federal suit against Microsoft, a quarter-century ago, are unmistakable. In the Google case, as with Microsoft then, a tech giant is accused of using its overwhelming market power to unfairly cut competitors off from potential customers.
But on the eve of the Google trial, it seems unimaginable that the case could command the widespread attention that the Microsoft proceedings did. Microsoft in the late 1990s was a singular tech titan and its leader, Bill Gates, was a national icon.
The Microsoft trial, which began in October 1998, spanned 76 days of testimony over more than eight months. Every major news organization covered it. The New York Times reported on the proceedings daily.
ADVERTISEMENT

It was a trial that often dealt with cerebral concepts like “network effects” and “switching costs.” Yet The Times gave it the kind of day-to-day coverage ordinarily reserved for very few courtroom dramas over the years, like the O.J. Simpson trial and the Lindbergh kidnapping trial.
Many days, there were spin sessions on the courthouse steps. Microsoft representatives would say the government had presented isolated snippets of text, taken out of context, certainly not proof of anti-competitive conduct. Lawyers for the Justice Department and states who joined the lawsuit would mostly say the damning testimony spoke for itself."

Disney and Charter Communications resolved their differences in time for pro football fans to watch Aaron Rodgers’ inauspicious debut with the New York Jets.

Seth Wenig/Associated Press
Breaking down the Disney-Charter deal
Hours before “Monday Night Football” was set to air, Disney settled its fight with Charter Communications that would have kept nearly 15 million cable subscribers from seeing the day’s big N.F.L. game (and the injury-shortened debut of Aaron Rodgers as the New York Jets quarterback) live at home.
Analysts and media watchers had wondered how much the fight, in which channels including ESPN were unavailable on the nation’s second-biggest cable provider for more than a week, would weaken Disney. The early verdict: Disney gave up less than expected — but made concessions that could eventually remake the pay-TV business.
Disney will gain more reach for its streaming services, which the company views as a vital part of its future. Charter agreed to offer the ad-supported version of its Disney+ streaming platform to some of its subscribers, paying a wholesale rate for the service instead of getting it for free as the cable provider had demanded. That could help boost subscriber numbers for Disney+, which has lost millions of customers in recent months.
Charter also agreed to provide ESPN+ (largely a companion to its cable-channel sibling) as part of its sports-focused bundle. More important, when Disney finally introduces a direct-to-consumer version of ESPN that includes streaming of big sports events, the broadband provider can also offer that to its consumers.

Charter claimed some victories, too. It will pay more for Disney’s top-tier channels like ESPN, but it will cut its costs by dropping a bunch of others, including Disney Junior and the women-focused Freeform. The analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson estimated that the move would cost Disney some $300 million a year in lost fees.
Disney executives conceded that they lost ground, but achieved something else: “We protected our primary entertainment channels,” Dana Walden, the co-chair of the company’s entertainment division, told The Hollywood Reporter.
The battle may shape other fights over content. Charter had threatened to drop Disney channels altogether if it didn’t get access to Disney’s streaming services, a scorched-earth move that would have deprived the entertainment company of billions in carriage fees. Charter is now getting them — not for free, but still at a reduced rate.
Analysts credited Disney with dodging a worst-case scenario. But while Disney executives argued that the settlement wouldn’t set a precedent for future negotiations with cable companies, media watchers say that’s still what happened.

Expect more battles soon. Charter is set to hold talks with more content providers over the next 18 months.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The White House says more companies pledge to make A.I. safe. Eight businesses, including Nvidia, Palantir and Salesforce, said they would join Google and Microsoft in voluntarily abiding by standards for safety, security and trust. The news comes as prominent tech executives meet with lawmakers in Washington this week to discuss the fast-evolving technology.
The C.D.C. will weigh in on new Covid boosters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to confer with advisers on who should receive the new shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, after the F.D.A. cleared the vaccines on Monday. The government is expected to roll out a new vaccine campaign, urging Americans to receive the updated doses like they do with annual flu shots.
The order book for Arm’s I.P.O. will reportedly close early. Underwriters for the chip designer’s stock sale may stop accepting bids on Tuesday instead of Wednesday as planned amid strong demand, according to The Financial Times. That would be good news for the Japanese tech giant SoftBank, which owns Arm — and which desperately needs a win after years of investing flubs.
The U.A.W. is said to lower its demands for wage increases. In contract negotiations with America’s Big Three carmakers, the autoworkers union is now seeking a raise in the mid-30 percent range, instead of 40 percent, according to The Wall Street Journal. The concession comes ahead of a Thursday evening deadline for the talks; the U.A.W. has threatened to strike if provisional deals aren’t reached by then.

Antitrust armies prepare to battle over Google
The biggest antitrust trial of a generation — the Justice Department taking on Google over its dominance in search — is set to begin Tuesday in Washington. On one side is the government, animated by the most aggressive and progressive views on competition law in decades. On the other is Google, which prosecutors accuse of effectively being the new Microsoft, the subject of the last big antitrust fight.
Many of the lawyers involved have been battling for years. The government team is overseen by Jonathan Kanter, the Justice Department’s antitrust chief who is cracking down on tech titans. Before his appointment two years ago, he represented Microsoft and Yelp in their own legal fights against Google. (In 2021, Google sought to force Kanter’s recusal from an investigation into the company’s dominance of advertising technology.) Four prosecutors working on the case also worked on the Microsoft antitrust fight in the 1990s, including Ken Dintzer, who is leading the trial for the government.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Meanwhile, Google’s top lawyer, Kent Walker, was deputy general counsel at  Netscape — which had accused Microsoft of improperly bundling a rival web browser with Windows.
The case carries echoes of the Microsoft fight. The Justice Department is explicitly comparing Google’s search approach to Microsoft’s actions during the so-called browser wars. In today’s case, prosecutors say Google paid partners like Apple billions of dollars to make its search engine the default option on their web browsers, unfairly diminishing the reach of rivals … like Microsoft’s Bing.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Google is playing down the Microsoft comparisons. Walker says that his company is different in a key respect: Its dominance is because it’s popular with users, rather than being foisted upon them by default. He adds that users are able switch to competitors’ offerings.
Will the case end up like the Microsoft antitrust fight? In that instance, the Justice Department initially won, but an appellate court overturned some aspects of that decision. The two sides eventually settled, with the government agreeing not to pursue a breakup of the company in exchange for the tech giant agreeing to change some of its business practices.
Experts say that even if Kanter and his team win, it’s unlikely that Google would be forced to break up. The key question is what limits might be placed on the tech giant — assuming that it also loses what will assuredly be an appeal.
A big day for Apple
Apple is expected to reveal the 17th generation of its iPhone on Tuesday, as it looks for another hit to lift a stock that has fallen more than 8 percent since late July. But concerns around the sputtering smartphone market and the company’s hurdles in China are dampening some of the buzz around the iPhone 15’s debut.

Here are three things to watch for at Tuesday’s event:
The cost: Analysts say Apple will probably price the iPhone 15 at least $100 above the iPhone 14. The iPhone has fared better than its lower-priced competitors, even as the economy flails. But cracks are appearing in its premium-priced strategy as sales have ticked lower for three straight quarters.
Will the phone’s new features be enough to lure customers? Richard Kramer, a partner at Arete Research,  told The Times last month that the iPhone had entered a phase where improvements were becoming “incrementally incremental.” (That seems to be the case with the latest model, the iPhone rumor mill has reported.) To wit: Customers are now upgrading their handsets less frequently.
A new charger: In order to comply with new European regulations, Apple is expected to replace its proprietary Lightning charging port with a standard USB-C charging port (the same connector found on Android phones and other non-Apple consumer electronic devices), starting with the iPhone 15.

What to watch in tomorrow’s C.P.I. release
After a messy August, stocks have rebounded in recent days on renewed hopes that the Fed is done raising interest rates. But a new batch of inflation data to be released this week — the Consumer Price Index comes out tomorrow, followed by the Producer Price Index on Thursday — is expected to test that conviction. And consumers are still feeling squeezed.
The C.P.I. figure is forecast to show the inflation fight is far from over. The closely watched core inflation reading for August, which excludes food and fuel, is expected to reveal a 4.3 percent year-on-year gain. That would be a big improvement from a year ago, but still well above the Fed’s 2 percent target.
The headline figure is more troublesome. Energy and food prices have been increasing again — airfares, insurance and online subscriptions costs are higher, or are rising, economists say — and that will lead to a 3.6 percent year-on-year increase. That’s up from 3.2 percent in July.
Even still, Wall Street is betting the Fed will hold tight on rates at next week’s meeting. “We believe the underlying inflation trend remains soft,” Aichi Amemiya and Jeremy Schwartz, economists at Nomura, wrote in a research note on Monday. They added that “the Fed will likely keep rates on hold through year-end.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Consumers are feeling less upbeat. The New York Fed released its latest consumer survey on Monday, with respondents saying they see declines in both income-growth and access to credit. They expect inflation in the short term to nudge higher, too.
Plugging into the uncertain outlook, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JP Morgan Chase, warned on Monday that it would be a “huge mistake” to bet on the consumer powering economic growth well into the future.
Most economists see the U.S. avoiding recession. But doubts about the economy look set to be a major talking point heading into the 2024 race for the White House. A bad sign for the Biden administration: even for those who feel the economy has performed better than expected, few appear to be giving the White House much credit for it.

2023-09-13,"The California Legislature this week passed a landmark bill that would require major companies to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, a move with national and global repercussions in governments’ efforts to fight climate change.
A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, declined on Wednesday to say whether he would sign the bill.
If enacted, about 5,000 companies that do business in California would be compelled to report the amount of greenhouse gas pollution that is directly emitted by their operations, and also indirect emissions from things like employee travel, waste disposal and supply chains.
The law would apply to public and private businesses that make more than $1 billion annually and operate in California. But because it is the world’s fifth-largest economy, California often sets the trend for the nation.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Many of the affected businesses would include oil and gas giants like Chevron, major financial institutions like Wells Fargo and global brands like Apple. The companies would be required to disclose all their emissions starting in 2027.
The California legislation goes beyond a measure proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would require only publicly-traded companies to disclose their emissions. That proposal, which has yet to be finalized, is facing strong opposition from conservatives and business groups.
Opponents of the California measure said compliance would be expensive and onerous, particularly the requirement that businesses accurately track and measure all emissions. For example, clothing manufacturers worry that they would have to report the emissions associated with growing, weaving and transporting textiles, in addition to reporting the direct emissions from their garment manufacturing plants.
The legislation “is a costly mandate that will negatively impact businesses of all sizes in California and will not directly reduce emissions,” said Denise Davis, an executive vice president at the California Chamber of Commerce.
But supporters of disclosure said transparency would nudge corporations to reduce the pollution that is dangerously heating the planet and act as a bulwark against greenwashing, false or exaggerated claims by companies about their efforts to fight climate change. Microsoft, Ikea, Patagonia and several other major companies backed the bill.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“We need the full picture to make the deep emissions cuts that scientists tell us are necessary to avert the worst impacts of climate change,” said the lead sponsor of the law, State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco. “These disclosures are simple but transformational,” he said. “We need strong transparency to create a level playing field among private and public companies. Once again, California is leading the nation on essential climate action.”
Governor Newsom, who has built a national profile in part on his push to make California a global leader in climate policy, has been uncharacteristically quiet about the measure.
While the governor has championed aggressive new climate measures, including $54 billion in climate spending, his administration’s finance department issued an analysis in July that opposed the emissions reporting legislation. The analysis said the measure would require 12 full-time workers to administer the program and result in costs that were not included in the state’s current spending plan.
California has a long history of enacting climate change policies that are later adopted by other states and eventually the federal government. Both the Obama administration and the Biden administration have modeled their regulations to accelerate the use of electric vehicles on policies first enacted in California.
Mr. Newsom has until Oct. 14 to veto the bill or it automatically becomes state law."

Masa Son, the SoftBank founder, is hoping for an auspicious trading debut for Arm, the chip design firm his company owns.

Arm is ready to make its market debut
All eyes are on Arm Thursday as the chip designer prepares to begin trading on the Nasdaq in the biggest initial public offering of the year. The company priced its shares on Wendesday at $51 each, the top end of its range, valuing it at about $54.5 billion.
A lot is riding on Arm’s debut: Success may help revive a moribund market for I.P.O.s, as well as the fortunes of the company’s parent, the Japanese tech giant SoftBank, which is looking for a win after a string of disappointing investments.
Arm’s I.P.O. is big, but some had hoped for more. SoftBank had initially wished the company would be valued at as much as $70 billion. (Earlier this year, it had appraised Arm at $64 billion.) And it had pitched Arm as a major player in designing chips for artificial intelligence applications, a tech sector that investors have flocked to.
But valuations of privately held companies have fallen sharply over the past year, and investors were reportedly concerned about Arm’s so-so financial performance of late.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Still, the deal is probably a win for SoftBank. The $54.5 billion valuation is significantly higher than the $32 billion that it paid for Arm in 2016. And a richer appraisal could help SoftBank, which could then borrow more against its remaining stake in the company to raise more cash for investments.
SoftBank played it safe in taking Arm public, rather than taking the sort of grand risks it has long been known for: It sold about 10 percent of the company’s shares in the I.P.O., and its founder, Masa Son, reportedly favored pricing the deal at $51 a share, despite some underwriters suggesting going to $52 apiece.
What comes next? Wall Street has hoped that a successful Arm debut could restore investor confidence in I.P.O.s, jump-starting a market that has been largely flat over the past year. (That said, the offerings for younger, smaller companies, like Instacart and the marketing software provider Klaviyo, may be better indications of the health of the I.P.O. business.)
SoftBank also hopes that investors will regard the chip designer as a key part of the A.I. revolution, giving it the kind of runaway valuation lift Nvidia enjoys. But Arm is best known for making the low-power chips used in smartphones, a market that’s now stagnating, and it has only in recent years started making inroads into A.I.-focused data centers.

The Fed’s higher-for-longer inflation problem
The markets this morning were nudging up the odds that the central bank will be forced to raise interest rates again this year after Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index report showed that inflation was running higher than expected.
Here are a few takeaways from the latest C.P.I. data:
The inflation outlook: higher for longer. Both the “headline” and “core” inflation readings, which strip out fuel and food costs, were above economists’ forecasts.  Inflation is decelerating, but Wall Street analysts now see it remaining well above the Fed’s 2 percent target until late 2024.
Keep an eye on energy prices. Gasoline prices spiked, jumping 10.6 percent on a monthly basis. Crude oil prices are rising this morning, trading at around a 10-month high. High fuel prices have a multiplier effect on how companies set prices, which could explain why airfares have rebounded, rising nearly 5 percent last month compared with the July figure.
Economists still expect the Fed to hold tight on rates next week. But according to the CME FedWatch indicator, the futures market now gives a 39 percent chance of the central bank raising borrowing costs at its December meeting.

As Peter Orszag prepares to take the reins of Lazard on Oct. 1, the Democratic economist turned banker is laying out his priorities for the 175-year-old investment bank, including stepped-up recruiting and improving the company’s stock performance.
That’s all in service of ambitious goals, he told DealBook, including a doubling of revenue by 2030 and maintaining Lazard’s reputation as a top adviser to C.E.O.s and governments.
Lazard needs to grow in revenue, returns and relevance, Orszag wrote in an internal memo reviewed by DealBook. Doing that will mean winning more banking mandates, expanding the firm’s asset-management business (perhaps through acquisitions) and improving total shareholder returns to an average of 10 percent to 15 percent, in line with competitors.
It also means recruiting more bankers — a task that Orszag said improving perceptions about Lazard as a place to work could help with. “In some settings, fairly or unfairly, Lazard’s reputation lags,” he said.
The firm should benefit from improving conditions for investment banking. Orszag said that tailwinds for the business were improving as interest-rate rises by the Fed appear to be slowing and markets pick up. Also providing relief were signs that the Biden administration may back off slightly from aggressive antitrust enforcement, he said, after a setback in fighting Microsoft’s $70 billion takeover bid for Activision Blizzard.

But Orszag cautioned that all of this won’t translate into an immediate boost to business, because it will take time for new M.&A. talks to flower into completed deals.
Orszag predicted that Lazard would remain public for some time to come, despite a move by a rival bank, Rothschild, to go private and reports that his own firm had explored a similar move with an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund.
Though the firm’s stock price has underperformed the wider market, he argued that Lazard’s pool of talent and business opportunities were a good foundation for better days ahead. “We’re a public company and have a lot of growth potential,” he said.

Bernard Arnault, 74, the C.E.O. of LVMH, is waving off succession questions.

Who will succeed Bernard Arnault?
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire behind LVMH, has ridden a decades-long global luxury boom to turn his holding group into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
But who will succeed Arnault, 74, is a question hanging over the group. He has given no indication that he is preparing to step back and even persuaded the board last year to raise the mandatory retirement age for C.E.O. and chairman to 80, from 75.
Still, a leading theory is that one or more of Arnault’s five children, each of whom holds an executive role at LVMH, are next in line.
The Times’s Liz Alderman and Vanessa Friedman spoke to Arnault and his children and report on what to expect next from the family.
“The best person inside the family or outside the family should be one day my successor,” Mr. Arnault continued. “But it’s not something that I hope is a duel for the near future.”
Still, legacy is clearly on Mr. Arnault’s mind. He grew up in Roubaix, once a booming textile center in northern France, and watched family industrial dynasties collapse as children or grandchildren took their eyes off the business or squandered inheritances.
“After one or two generations, it broke down because they had it too easy,” he said. It was a mistake he vowed not to make with his own children. “I didn’t want them to start going to big parties,” Mr. Arnault said. “I made them work.”
Assessing the China risk
Lawmakers on both sides of the House are calling for more limits on U.S. capital flows to China after President Biden signed an executive order last month banning investments in some high-tech sectors. But a House committee’s trip to Wall Street this week highlighted the challenges of disentangling financial links.

“More can be done,” Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said on Wednesday at a hearing. She called on the Biden administration to review passive investing in Chinese companies through mutual funds and indexes, and wants more scrutiny of Chinese investments by private equity and venture capital firms.
Another area of concern: a potential invasion of Taiwan. Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin, who heads a committee on competition with China, told DealBook that he “totally disagrees” with Biden’s assessment that China’s economic woes lessen the chances of an invasion. Taiwan is self-governed but China claims sovereignty over the territory and has threatened to take it by force.
His committee held a wargame-like exercise to demonstrate the potential effect on supply chains and the financial system, and Gallagher said an invasion would be a huge upheaval for the “U.S. economy and banking system.”
Congress is being urged to act. Jay Clayton, the former S.E.C. chair who spoke to the committee, said that there should be more scrutiny of and restrictions on outbound investments. Asking companies to make “shades of gray” distinctions about national security and human rights is unrealistic, he added, but Wall Street would respond quickly to government signals.

2023-09-16,"The United Automobile Workers strike is in its second day, and already it’s being framed as potentially the most costly of work stoppages from the “summer of strikes.”
Unions aren’t just fighting for an inflation-beating wage boost. They also are campaigning for job security at a time when workers increasingly fear that shifts to new technologies, like electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, threaten their job, and tech bosses themselves say this gloomy outlook is inevitable.
Union leaders had a seat at the table this week in Washington at an A.I. forum organized by Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, and attended by tech leaders, such as Elon Musk, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Jensen Huang of Nvidia. Their presence signals their growing clout in discussions about the future of the technology.
Concern over disruptive technologies are seen on the picket lines. The Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union, fear studios are embracing A.I. tools to generate scripts or copy the performances of actors. “If we don’t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in trouble,” Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, warned in July. “We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines.”

The U.A.W., meanwhile, is concerned that the industry’s shift to electric vehicles will require fewer workers, and that many of the jobs needed will be in battery factories, most of which are not unionized.
Giving workers a voice in the use of technology has taken on new urgency, said Thomas Kochan, an emeritus professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, who has been studying the future of work since the 1980s: “Generative A.I. in particular has just exploded on the scene in a way that’s going to make this one of the most controversial and one of the most important workplace issues of our time.”
The clock is ticking. It’s strategic for unions to get involved early. Otherwise, companies can say, “We’re already using the technology; we’re not really interested in your ideas about how we could be better using it,” said Adam Seth Litwin, an associate professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University.
Companies aren’t legally obligated to negotiate with unions over early-stage decisions on how new technologies are used. Unions “only have a right to negotiate over the impacts of technology on wages, hours and working conditions,” Kochan said. The thornier issue of what and how technology is deployed, he said, is “the frontier of collective bargaining today.”
One breakthrough for labor came in 2018, when Marriott Hotel workers went on strike at 49 locations. After a six-week stoppage, the company agreed to give the union notice before introducing technologies that would affect workers’ jobs and the right to discuss the changes with management.

Why would companies benefit from worker input? “If technologies are not developed with the user in mind, they often fail,” said Lisa Kresge, a research and policy associate at the University of California Berkeley Labor Center, who has written about union responses to technology. Take those Marriott workers: At the time, they said a new housekeeping app sent them inefficiently bouncing between floors when they could have worked faster by cleaning rooms clustered together.
Labor Organizing and Union Drives
Warehouse Quotas Law: A California labor regulator said that it had fined Amazon nearly $6 million for thousands of violations of a safety law that took effect in 2022.
Amazon: An affiliation agreement between the Amazon Labor Union and the 1.3 million-member Teamsters signals an escalation in challenging the online retailer to bargain over wages and working conditions.
Starbucks: The Supreme Court sided with the company in a case over whether regulators can intervene when a company is accused of suppressing labor organizing by firing workers. 
U.A.W.: Leaders of the United Automobile Workers are trying to smooth out the dissonance between its victories on red-state assembly lines and its pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.
“If the only option that the labor movement places on the table is ‘No, we don’t want the technology that will hurt our workers,’ that will not be enough,” said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. and a co-author of “Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle Over Technology & Prosperity.” The key, he said, is for labor to articulate how the technologies can be used “to the great benefit of the workers as well as the businesses.” That’s “what’s missing right now” in the labor negotiations, Acemoglu added.
Federal proposals to regulate A.I. — in relation to work or otherwise — are barely underway. That leaves the unions, which represent only about 6 percent of the private sector work force, fighting a lonely battle. “If your company is automating and you want a voice in that process, and you are not unionized,” Acemoglu said, “then there is not much you can do.” — Sarah Kessler

Natural assets
After a summer filled with catastrophic floods, blistering heat domes and devastating wildfires, government and business leaders from around the world are set to discuss efforts to mitigate climate change at the United Nations Climate Ambition Summit in New York on Wednesday.
The usual topics are on the agenda, including net-zero targets, energy transition plans and renewable energy targets.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But these solutions may be missing something fundamental, according to Partha Dasgupta, an economist at the University of Cambridge. In a 2021 report commissioned by the British government, Dasgupta made the case for shifting how natural resources are valued, and the idea has since gained momentum: Last month, the White House released a draft proposal on what should be considered in a cost-benefit analysis when it comes to ecosystem services in government, practices that draw on his work.
DealBook spoke with Dasgupta about updating economics to account for nature.
Traditional economics does not account for the value Earth provides, Dasgupta said, but instead assumes that ecosystems are self-regenerating and able to offer services indefinitely and that there will be an infinite supply of materials. His report included what he calls an “important new set of calculations” for treating natural resources like the ocean and functions, like pollination, as assets, which, theoretically, increase the chances that we invest in and manage our ecosystems to allow for the production of more goods. “Asset management is a very well understood phenomenon,” Dasgupta said. “But for a variety of reasons, Mother Nature’s assets don’t carry the signals we need to manage them adequately.”
How this idea is applied will vary from place to place, Dasgupta said, but now there is a vocabulary and method for addressing the underlying issues. The Biden proposal, for example, cites “failing to fully account for nature’s bounty” as having led to an “erosion of our nation’s natural assets.” Dasgupta called the proposal “a fine piece of work,” but he said that he wasn’t confident it would be put into effect, or that his ideas more broadly would be understood fast enough to prevent disaster. “We’re in a firefighting situation,” he said. “Extreme weather events are happening even as we speak.”
Dasgupta worries that an important nuance within his work gets lost, even as it becomes more well known. The services of nature are interconnected, and “they can be brought down like a house of cards,” he said. “You remove one card from the house and the whole house collapses.” So climate change solutions that focus on goods and tech, like replacing oil with solar power, fail to account for the full picture — the interconnectedness of everything.
Policymakers often assume that a few tweaks and some human ingenuity will allow for infinite goods and growth; Dasgupta does not.

On our radar: ‘Dumb Money’
Remember the meme-stock craze of 2021? The sudden jump in shares of the video game retailer GameStop, driven by Reddit-fueled day traders, rattled financial titans — especially the hedge fund moguls who had bet against the company’s stock price. It was seen briefly as a moment of Main Street’s beating Wall Street at its own game.
That heady time is chronicled in “Dumb Money,” an exuberant comedy that aims to do for GameStop what “The Big Short” did for the 2008 global financial crisis. Out now in limited release, the movie features a cast of big-name actors, including Paul Dano, America Ferrera and Seth Rogen, playing a mix of real-life characters and fictional composites who feature on both sides of the trading conflict.

“Dumb Money” is connected to Wall Street behind the scenes, too: The film was financed and produced by Teddy Schwarzman, son of the Blackstone co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman, and written by two former Wall Street Journal reporters, Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo. But it’s not exactly sympathetic to the hedge fund side of the story — to the point that Ken Griffin of Citadel has reportedly threatened to sue over his portrayal.
Alison Willmore of Vulture wrote in a review that “the pleasant surprise of ‘Dumb Money’ is that it’s such an effective entertainment.” The New York Times’s Ben Kenigsberg described the film as “an energetic, ingratiating dramatization” but the “humanizing efforts are less inspired.”

2023-09-17,"As China’s spy balloon drifted across the continental United States in February, American intelligence agencies learned that President Xi Jinping of China had become enraged with senior Chinese military generals.
The spy agencies had been trying to understand what Mr. Xi knew and what actions he would take as the balloon, originally aimed at U.S. military bases in Guam and Hawaii, was blown off course.
Mr. Xi was not opposed to risky spying operations against the United States, but American intelligence agencies concluded that the People’s Liberation Army had kept Mr. Xi in the dark until the balloon was over the United States.
American officials would not discuss how spy agencies gleaned this information. But in details reported here for the first time, they discovered that when Mr. Xi learned of the balloon’s trajectory and realized it was derailing planned talks with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, he berated senior generals for failing to tell him that the balloon had gone astray, according to American officials briefed on the intelligence.
The episode threw a spotlight on the expanding and highly secretive spy-versus-spy contest between the United States and China. The balloon crisis, a small part of a much larger Chinese espionage effort, reflects a brazen new aggressiveness by Beijing in gathering intelligence on the United States as well as Washington’s growing capabilities to collect its own information on China.
For Washington, the espionage efforts are a critical part of President Biden’s strategy to constrain the military and technological rise of China, in line with his thinking that the country poses the greatest long-term challenge to American power.

2023-09-20,"Imagine if every time you went to the supermarket, your shopping cart came loaded with the same box of cereal.
This cereal happens to be the most popular, so it’s convenient for the store to have it in the cart. If you don’t like it, it’s simple enough to put it back on the shelf and grab a different box.
That’s essentially the crux of Google’s defense against the Justice Department in a consequential antitrust trial — the federal government’s first such case in the modern internet era — that is now unfolding in court.
The government has accused Google of illegally using partnerships with handset makers, computer manufacturers and browser developers to stifle competitors in online search. Under those partnerships, the Justice Department argues, Google made its search engine the default service on an overwhelming majority of consumer electronics, like smartphones. That then deterred people from trying alternative search engines, like Bing, DuckDuckGo and others.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But Google has argued that it’s easy for people to change their search engine — just as simple as putting a box of cereal back on the store shelf.
The trial raises questions about how and why we use Google search. Many of us grew up doing web searches on Google because it seemed to deliver the best results with minimal effort. But if something better came along, would we really have known since Google came loaded on most of our devices? And even if we had known, would we have just stuck with Google since its search engine was set as the default?
I decided to test how easy or hard it really is to switch to a different search engine. In a blog post this month, Google said the change was a straightforward process and offered three examples:
On an iPhone, it takes four taps.
On a Mac’s Safari browser, it takes two clicks.
On Android phones, it takes two taps.
So I followed Google’s instructions and also shared the company’s guidance with a panel of three design veterans. The verdict: It’s hard to switch — and most people would probably give up before completing the change.
“God help me, I’m dead,” Ted Selker, a product design veteran who worked at IBM and Xerox PARC, said after reading the steps to change the search engine on an iPhone.
Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, concluded about Google search: “Most people will just stick with it.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
I had similar takeaways. Here’s what the design experts and I found after trying to break up with Google search.
On an iPhone
Google said iPhone owners could switch to a different search engine in four taps by opening the Settings app, tapping Safari, tapping Search Engine and then selecting a search engine.
In reality, it’s more complicated.
Once the Settings app is open, Safari doesn’t immediately appear on the screen. It’s buried under 36 other menu items, so the user has to swipe upward at least twice to find the Safari menu. In reality, it takes six taps.
But even four steps would probably be too much for many of us, Mr. Selker said. It might have been simple 15 years ago, when most web browsing was done on stationary computers, but in the smartphone era, someone looking for that setting could be interrupted while on the go — to hop on a bus, for instance.
“You cannot expect people to have multi-stepped memory,” he said.
On a Mac
With just two clicks, Google said, Mac users can switch the default search engine on the Safari browser to a different service — by first clicking on the magnifying glass icon and then selecting a different search engine, like Yahoo, Bing or DuckDuckGo.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That’s much simpler than on an iPhone. But not everyone knows that the magnifying glass icon is a button — it allows people to enter a query in the search bar.
More problematic is that switching search engines can be confusing, because the steps are inconsistent between Safari on an iPhone and Safari on a Mac, said Tony Hu, a director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who oversees an engineering leadership program.
“Overall, the average person would probably struggle with this,” he said.
Mr. Selker said a better design would have been to make changing the search engine more “in your face,” like a prompt asking users to choose a search engine when opening the browser.
“It has to make you aware it’s there until you’ve dismissed it,” he said.
On Android
On an Android phone, Google said, it takes one long press on the search bar to prompt the Remove button to appear. Users can then tap on it to remove the Google search bar widget from the home screen.
This example is especially flawed. First, Google’s steps to remove the search bar widget work on some Samsung phones, but they do not work across all Android devices. On Google’s Pixel phones, for example, when a user long presses on the search bar, no Remove option appears.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Most important, removing the search widget deletes a shortcut to the Google search bar on the home screen, but it does not change the search engine in an Android web browser. Changing to a different search engine requires a different set of steps. Similar to the path on iPhones, it’s a four-step process that involves opening the browser and changing its settings.
The default option
The overarching lesson from the government’s antitrust trial against Google is that when companies make arrangements to become a default option, they are aware you will probably stick with the status quo because switching to an alternative requires awareness and effort, said Mr. Brignull, the author of “Deceptive Patterns: Exposing the Tricks Tech Companies Use to Control You.”
Google said in a statement that it was easy for people to change their default search engine on Android devices and Apple’s Safari. The company added that on Windows computers, which require a long process to switch from Bing as the default search engine in Microsoft’s Edge browser, the overwhelming majority of people chose Google as their search engine.
With all of that in mind, and the instructions now in front of you, you can try other search engines. If it turns out that you prefer Google anyway, at least it will be your decision — not Google’s."
2023-09-21,"Cisco agreed on Thursday to buy Splunk, a data-analysis software company, for $28 billion in cash, as technology giants continue to look to acquisitions as a way to grow — particularly in hot sectors like artificial intelligence.
The deal is the largest ever announced by Cisco, a longtime buyer of smaller tech companies, and suggests the company is willing to test antitrust officials’ growing opposition to big-ticket mergers and acquisitions.
Founded in 2003, Splunk — whose name refers to spelunking, or cave exploration — focuses on mining its customers’ data for insights, particularly on security vulnerabilities and other trends in their business. This summer, Splunk announced a flurry of A.I.-infused services meant to help companies detect and respond to potential issues more quickly.
Cisco said it planned to combine Splunk’s capabilities with its own security offerings, including the monitoring of customers’ network data, web traffic and emails.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“I consistently heard from our customers the strategic importance of what Splunk does,” Chuck Robbins, the Cisco chief executive, said in an interview. Combining Splunk’s systems with the information collected from Cisco’s, he said, presented an “opportunity to bring a level of insight that’s unmatched.”
Gary Steele, the Splunk chief executive, added that Cisco’s bigger sales footprint would help his company sell its products more widely, especially internationally. Mr. Steele is set to stay on as a member of Cisco’s leadership team when the transaction closes, which is expected by the fall of next year.
The deal moves Cisco further away from its roots in network hardware and into higher-margin, more predictable software subscriptions.
Much of Cisco’s push into software is being driven by acquisitions: The company has announced eight takeovers this year, according to S&P Capital IQ.
By some measures, Cisco is paying a high price. The transaction valued Splunk at $157 a share, a 31 percent premium to where its stock closed on Wednesday and 25 percent above the company’s 52-week high. (Cisco had held discussions to buy Splunk early last year.)
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Shares in Cisco fell 4 percent after the deal was announced. Shares in Splunk rose on the news, but still traded below the acquisition offer price, suggesting investors were somewhat skeptical that the deal would be completed. Among the potential concerns is whether antitrust regulators will approve the transaction, given increased scrutiny of big mergers by the Biden administration.
Privately, corporate executives have said recent setbacks for regulators, including defeats for the Federal Trade Commission’s effort to block Microsoft’s $70 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, could make it easier to do deals.
Mr. Robbins expressed confidence in the Cisco-Splunk deal’s clearing antitrust hurdles, because there is little overlap in the companies’ products."

Rupert Murdoch revealed a succession plan.

The next chapter in the Murdoch family drama
Rupert Murdoch’s bombshell retirement announcement on Thursday apparently ended some speculation over a real-life succession story that gripped the business world (and even inspired a must-watch fictional one). Murdoch, 92, will become chairman emeritus of Fox and News Corporation and named Lachlan, his elder son, as the designated heir.
But is Murdoch really hanging up his spikes? The Times’s Edmund Lee writes on why succession isn’t settled.
Murdoch isn’t about to disappear. In his farewell note to staff, he made clear he would “be watching our broadcasts with a critical eye, reading our newspapers and websites and books with much interest, and reaching out to you with thoughts, ideas, and advice.”
In his seven decades as a media baron, Murdoch’s favorite part of the job has been talking to his editors about big stories. He won’t stop doing that.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Murdoch still has a huge say in the companies’ operations. He is the majority shareholder of a family trust that owns significant stakes in each business. The trust manages about 40 percent of the voting stock in News Corp and 43 percent of voting shares in the more valuable Fox. In other words, he’s still in charge.
The real succession battle still looms. When Murdoch dies, four of his children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence — will have an equal say in what happens next because they will inherit his voting shares. And alongside his two other children from another marriage, they stand to inherit a fortune in some kind of deal for the companies. (The children made out nicely in the $71 billion sale of the majority of Fox’s assets to Disney in 2018, as each got about $2 billion.)
The revival of a failed deal could be in the offing. Murdoch tried to combine the two businesses last year, but called that off in January when shareholders balked. The hugely profitable Fox is driven largely by Fox News, and News Corp is now a hodgepodge that includes newspapers, digital real estate businesses and book publishing.
Both companies have shrunk severely over the years as the media landscape has been taken over by big tech and streaming. There hasn’t been a growth story to tell investors.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
What to watch for: A potential sale of the media empire, either as a whole or in parts. Fox’s stock jumped 3 percent and News Corp’s shares were up 1.3 percent after Murdoch’s announcement, widely outperforming the S&P 500, which fell 1.6 percent.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Hard-right Republicans block a defense bill, dealing a blow to Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Hours after the top House Republican signaled that he had won over some holdouts, a handful of his party’s lawmakers opposed the measure, renewing doubts that a government shutdown can be avoided this month.
The White House tells federal agencies to consider climate change in procurement decisions. New Biden administration guidelines could affect where the federal government spends roughly $600 billion annually on goods and services. The directive was issued as a judge in Texas denied an attempt by red states to block a federal rule allowing employee retirement plans to consider E.S.G. issues when making investment decisions.
Biden says Abrams tanks will start arriving in Ukraine next week. The decision came as Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, visited Washington to shore up support for his country despite Republican opposition to the cost of aid growing louder. Meanwhile, the European Commission is reportedly a step closer to starting discussions that would allow Ukraine to join the European Union.

A big tech deal suggests antitrust fears are receding
Cisco’s $28 billion deal to buy Splunk, announced on Thursday, was notable for a number of reasons, including for being the network hardware giant’s biggest-ever takeover — and for what it may portend for the future of megadeals.
The move reflects Cisco’s belief that the transaction will withstand the increased scrutiny of mergers by the Biden administration and other antitrust watchdogs. It suggests that corporate leaders are increasingly confident that heightened opposition to M.&A. may not be such an impediment.
The deal doesn’t pose a problem for competition — at least not based on traditional antitrust views, Chuck Robbins, Cisco’s C.E.O., told DealBook. Splunk, which mines customers’ data for insights on security vulnerabilities and other matters, complements rather than competes with his company’s own offerings. “This is not a roll-up,” he said. “We don’t have a lot of overlap in our portfolios.”
Investors may need convincing: Though shares in Splunk jumped nearly 21 percent on Thursday, they’re still trading below Cisco’s offer price of $157 a share.
But C.E.O.s are taking comfort from recent setbacks for regulators, including the F.T.C.’s defeat in its effort to block Microsoft’s nearly $70 billion takeover bid for Activision Blizzard. That deal is poised to close, after Britain’s antitrust regulator said on Friday that the companies had taken action that “substantially addresses” its concerns; Microsoft and Activision are aiming to close the transaction by Oct. 18.

Executives and deal advisers say privately that Biden’s antitrust enforcers may be feeling more gun-shy after the Microsoft defeat. (A commonly cited piece of evidence is the F.T.C. withdrawing its challenge to Amgen’s $27.8 billion takeover of Horizon Therapeutics.)
That said, the F.T.C. and the Justice Department have at least publicly committed to aggressive enforcement. And the F.T.C. sued a big anesthesiology company on Thursday, challenging a common private equity strategy of rolling up small businesses to create a more powerful player.
That renewed confidence could help bolster the flagging deal-making business, which is down 28 percent year on year, according to LSEG.
Goldman’s top I.P.O. banker on the state of play
On Thursday, shares in the ad-tech company Klaviyo finished their second day of trading 12 percent above the price set in its initial public offering. That’s below the heights the stock touched on its first day, but better than what’s happened to shares in the grocery delivery app Instacart and the chip designer Arm, which are now just above their debut prices.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That’s disappointing for investors who bought into the companies on their first days of trading. But David Ludwig, the global head of equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs, who helped lead all three I.P.O.s, argues that the shares are actually performing as well as can be expected in turbulent markets — and that there’s hope for the future.
Some analysts said that the companies may have overshot on valuations. Arm priced its offering at $51 a share, the high end of its forecast range, while Instacart priced its stock at the top of an already raised range, and Klaviyo was priced above expectations. Shares in each popped on their first day of trading before drifting down.
Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O.-focused data firm, suggested that the companies may have miscalculated investor demand. “The next deals will have to price more conservatively,” he told DealBook.
But Ludwig noted that the markets have been choppy, with the Nasdaq down nearly 6 percent since the beginning of September and the S&P 500 down 4 percent. “The market backdrop has clearly gotten tougher,” he told DealBook. “In a market that’s not fully healed yet, I think it’s good that companies can get access to the markets in a fairly efficient manner.”
Market expectations for a sudden I.P.O. resurgence may have been overblown. Given uncertainty over inflation and the Fed’s plans for interest rates, deal makers have actually been pushing back their expectations for a revival into next year. The I.P.O. calendar for the rest of 2023 looks fairly quiet, save for a few notable exceptions like the sandal maker Birkenstock.

The companies that can go public now share a number of qualities, including profitability and — for the more mature companies — strong balance sheets not weighed down by excessive debt, according to Ludwig. But he hopes that will change: “We expect a moderate reopening in 2023, and as the markets stabilize, the I.P.O. window will likely open to a broader array of companies,” he said.

Truth, consequences and FTX
As Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, prepares for his upcoming criminal trial, his parents are facing accusations too.

FTX debtors this week sued Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, longtime Stanford Law School professors, claiming they unjustly collected millions in cash, property and donations from the “family business.”
The claims are particularly notable in light of Bankman’s and Fried’s academic writings, which explore the nature of wrongdoing, honesty and consequences.
Bankman and Fried have written extensively about moral questions. Bankman, a tax expert, co-wrote a paper that proposes a fix for tax evasion: “changing the wording on existing returns to increase the psychological cost of evasion and increase the perceived expectation of detection.”
Fried is known for her work in legal ethics. Much of it focuses on consequentialism, a centuries-old idea that deems an action right or wrong depending on its outcomes. In a 2013 essay, she lamented a cultural enthusiasm for assigning blame, pointing to the 2008 housing crisis.
She noted soberly that “parental income and education are the most powerful predictors of whether a three-year-old will end up in the boardroom or in prison.”

FTX debtors accuse Bankman-Fried’s parents of ignoring “bright red signs,” and say they should have been able to see evidence of fraud at FTX companies. In a statement, lawyers for Bankman and Fried called FTX’s claims “completely false” and  “a dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child’s trial begins.”
Bankman joined the FTX payroll last year and complained to his son that his $200,000 salary was inadequate; he wanted $1 million. The filing details other perks, including a $16.4 million property in the Bahamas and a $10 million payout.
The FTX debtors want to claw it all back.

With a tentative deal in hand, the Writers Guild suspended picketing.

Hollywood writers reached a deal to end their strike
The Writers Guild of America, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters, could begin finalizing a deal on a new contract with entertainment companies as soon as tomorrow. The 146-day strike all but ended after the two sides reached a tentative deal on Sunday night.
But with the actors’ union, SAG-AFTRA, still on strike, the only productions that could restart in short order would be ones without actors, such as late-night shows and daytime talk shows. SAG-AFTRA and the studios have not spoken in more than two months, and no talks are scheduled. But the prospective writers’ deal should provide a blueprint for the actors, since many of their demands are similar.
The Writers Guild got most of what it demanded: increases in compensation for streaming content, concessions from studios on minimum staffing for television shows and guarantees that artificial intelligence technology would not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.
The tentative deal came after several senior company leaders joined the talks directly — among them Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive; Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive; and David Zaslav, who runs Warner Bros. Discovery.
Analysts have estimated that studios will forgo as much as $1.6 billion in global ticket sales for movies whose release was pushed to next year because of the actors’ strike. California’s economy alone has lost more than $5 billion from the Hollywood shutdown, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom.
What’s next: Writers’ rooms could get up and running soon. Writers Guild leadership must vote to approve the deal, which could happen as soon as tomorrow, and then the full membership must vote on whether to ratify the contract. Leadership must also vote on whether to end the strike, which could happen as the ratification vote among rank-and-file writers is underway.

The political stakes grow as the U.A.W. strike drags on.

Biden and Trump bid for blue collar votes
In an extraordinary show of support, President Biden plans to join striking autoworkers on the picket line in Michigan on Tuesday. It comes a day before Donald Trump is expected to speak to union members in Detroit instead of participating in the second Republican primary debate.
The competing visits come as the two home in on battleground states ahead of next year’s election. But their appearances also reveal a political battle to become the voice of blue collar workers at a time when both candidates are struggling to win over mainstream voters and even some within their own parties.
Bidenomics is a conundrum for the president. Biden says he is “the most pro-union president in American history” and has overseen one of the biggest industrial policy shifts in decades through the Inflation Reduction Act, offering billions of dollars in subsidies to create new manufacturing jobs in a push to greenify the economy.
But the president is getting little credit from voters. Approval ratings for his economic management are at career lows. And the I.R.A. is somewhat troublesome for him: It includes incentives for automakers to make more electric vehicles, which labor leaders say will depend on non-union jobs and require fewer workers.

The United Automobile Workers union has held back from endorsing Biden. The group was an early supporter of his economic road map but broke with other big unions. “The EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom,” Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, wrote to members in May.
Trump sees an opportunity to hammer Biden and the U.A.W. Trump, whose track record as a businessman and president often backed business over labor, will speak directly to workers, aiming to project himself as a protector of jobs. He has called the federal push for electric vehicles a “catastrophe for Michigan” that would cost American jobs, benefit China and raise prices for consumers.
Fain has said Trump would be a “disaster” if re-elected. But the former president’s rhetoric and policies like rewriting trade agreements have appealed to some union members.
Union votes could prove decisive in 2024. Trump won Michigan in 2016, but Biden took the state by more than 150,000 votes in 2020. In crucial swing states, even wooing a relatively small portion could be crucial. “In a strike situation, they’re all going out because they’re supporting their own economic interests,” said Alexander Colvin, the dean of Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. “That doesn’t mean they all think the same thing politically.”
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The F.C.C. is reportedly set to reinstate net neutrality rules. The regulator will revive Obama-era limits on broadband providers’ ability to unfairly interfere with internet traffic, after Democrats finally gained a majority among its commissioners, according to Bloomberg. Companies including AT&T and Comcast are likely to push back, arguing that such rules would be a big burden.

All eyes are on striking actors as screenwriters prepare for a vote on their labor deal. Leaders of the Writers Guild of America are to vote on their tentative pact with studios on Tuesday, with members set to weigh in soon. But there are few signs that an agreement with the SAG-AFTRA actors’ union is close, meaning that Hollywood will remain largely shut for now. Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA members voted to authorize a strike against video game companies.
Fossil fuel use needs to fall more quickly to contain global warming, the International Energy Agency says. Adoption of cleaner energy technologies like electric vehicles and solar is growing, but the use of fossil fuels must shrink faster to avoid a climate catastrophe, the agency said in its latest report. Some industry watchers said that the I.E.A. is still too optimistic about the decline in demand for oil and coal.

He didn’t address questions about bars of gold found on his property, but asserted that the $550,000 in cash found stuffed around his home was merely part of an emergency fund.

Growth concerns hit the bond market
Alarm bells are ringing for markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Investors have again sold off their sovereign bond holdings, especially Treasury notes and German bunds, pushing yields to highs last seen in 2007 just before the housing crisis and in 2011 during the European debt crisis.
ADVERTISEMENT

Growth concerns appear to be the culprit. Global trade fell in July at its fastest pace since the summer of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic snarled global markets. According to the newest World Trade Monitor report, the decline is the latest signal that global demand for goods is deteriorating, as inflation and high interest rates remain at multi-decade highs.
Jamie Dimon added fuel to the pessimistic outlook. The C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase warned of a kind of worst-case scenario in which the Fed is forced to keep raising its benchmark lending rate to combat inflation, further blunting growth. “I am not sure if the world is prepared for 7 percent,” he said in an interview with The Times of India, referring to the federal funds rate.
Fed policymakers themselves don’t see such a scenario playing out. They released a forecast last week suggesting that one more interest rate increase was in the cards this year, and possibly two cuts next year, which would keep interest rates at around 5 percent by the end of 2024. But since the Fed meeting, the futures market has been pricing in higher policy rates for longer, and that’s adding volatility to the bond market.
A potential U.S. government shutdown is also unnerving investors. The prospect that lawmakers will fail to reach a deal by Saturday’s deadline to fund the government is weighing on stocks, with U.S. futures in the red this morning. On Monday, Moody’s, the ratings agency, said a shutdown could lead it to downgrade the country’s credit rating — a warning that the White House seized upon in hopes of compelling the warring Republican factions to break their impasse on spending cuts.
The good news: The uncertainty has put a lid on the oil rally, with Brent crude falling below $91 a barrel this morning, a two-week low.

ChatGPT, can you take on Alexa?
Hours after Amazon announced a big bet on an artificial intelligence start-up — and days after it revealed plans to make its Alexa digital assistant smarter — one of the most prominent names in the A.I. race unveiled its plan to surpass those advancements.
OpenAI said its ChatGPT chatbot can now listen to users’ spoken requests and respond vocally, among other new capabilities. It’s a reminder of how fast the race to advance A.I. is moving — and how high the stakes are.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Voice is a more natural way of interacting with ChatGPT, according to OpenAI executives, who also said that their chatbot will feature voices that sound more natural than those of existing digital assistants. (The Times says that the voices sound better, but still come across as a little robotic.)
OpenAI is adding other features to ChatGPT, including image recognition. One example that OpenAI demonstrated: Share an image of a bicycle with the chatbot and it will instruct the user how to lower the seat.
Amazon seems aware of the risks of being outpaced by rivals. Unlike Alexa or Siri, which require users to ask specific commands, the latest version of ChatGPT is capable of more conversational interactions, including follow-up questions and clarifications. Wider adoption of that chatbot could risk Amazon losing its longtime dominance in the market for personal assistants.
The Alexa announcement last week, in which Amazon said that it was incorporating the large language model technology into its assistant, is meant to address that eventuality — though ChatGPT’s new capability will be available sooner.
With new capabilities come worries about new dangers. OpenAI executives said that they won’t let ChatGPT identify faces, though the software will be able to talk at length about other pictures it’s asked to analyze. There’s also the risk that greater use of ChatGPT will lead to potential mishaps involving the well-known A.I. weakness of inventing facts, known as hallucinating.

And Amazon, perhaps leery of the well-publicized hitches that Microsoft and Google suffered in rolling out advanced A.I. features to the wider public, is making the new Alexa features available initially only to some users in the U.S.
In other A.I. news: Meet the human workers training A.I. systems. Spotify says it won’t ban A.I.-produced music, but it will work with OpenAI to clone podcasters’ voices to produce versions of their shows in other languages. And New York Magazine asks whether Sam Altman, OpenAI’s C.E.O., is the Robert Oppenheimer of the digital age.

2023-09-27,"Chinese hackers who gained access to the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other government officials this year stole 60,000 emails from the State Department alone, according to two people familiar with a briefing Senate staff members received on the matter Wednesday.
The emails came from 10 State Department email accounts, department officials told Senate staff members, according to the people familiar with the briefing, one of whom is a staff member for Senator Eric Schmitt, Republican of Missouri. Nine of the 10 email accounts belonged to people working on East Asian and Pacific affairs.
The hack, which compromised Microsoft-based email accounts at the State and Commerce Departments, was first reported in July. At the time, neither U.S. government officials nor Microsoft executives would disclose how many email accounts they believed had been affected, nor how many emails the hackers had taken. The scope of the hack was reported earlier Wednesday by Reuters.
Washington has not formally blamed China for the intrusion, but various U.S. officials — including Ms. Raimondo — have made the connection.

The hackers used one stolen Microsoft certificate to penetrate the State Department email accounts, Biden administration officials told Senate staff members, and that token was used to hack 25 organizations and government agencies.
It is not yet clear what the substance of the emails was. U.S. officials have downplayed the notion that sensitive information could have been caught up in the hack, arguing that it had not compromised classified email accounts. The breaches took place in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken traveled to China. He was the first of a series of cabinet officials to make the trip as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to smooth over frayed diplomatic ties between Washington and Beijing, while at the same time imposing restrictions on investments Americans can make in certain Chinese sectors.
Mr. Schmitt said in a statement that the government’s reliance on lone vendors to facilitate systems — in this case, Microsoft — created unacceptable vulnerabilities in the system. He has pushed for the Defense Department to scrutinize its own reliance on similar single-vendor systems.
“We need to harden our defenses against these types of cyberattacks and intrusions in the future, and we need to take a hard look at the federal government’s reliance on a single vendor as a potential weak point,” Mr. Schmitt said in the statement, promising to press officials “for more answers to ensure China and other nefarious actors do not gain access to the federal government’s most sensitive information.”"
2023-09-28,"If the area around Jackson, Wyo., boasts two things, they’re natural resources and very rich locals. Nathan Wendt is trying to use the Biden administration’s clean energy incentives to bring the two together.
Mr. Wendt, the president of the Jackson Hole Center for Global Affairs, has spent years working on issues related to climate change and local economic development. And as President Biden pushed one climate-related policy after another through Congress — first the infrastructure law, and then the Inflation Reduction Act — and a dizzying array of tax credits, loans and grants became available, he sensed an opportunity.
“For Jackson Hole investors looking for the next big thing, there’s no need to look beyond state lines,” Mr. Wendt wrote this spring in an opinion essay in The Jackson Hole News & Guide, where he extolled the “flush tax credits” the law provided. “This decade’s great money-making opportunity,” he wrote, “will be in investing in net zero projects in energy communities, including in Wyoming.”
Wyoming is both the nation’s largest coal producer and a Republican stronghold where the clean energy transition has at times faced stark opposition. Its entire congressional delegation voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. But the state is unusually well suited to benefit from some of the green incentives the government is offering.

Wyoming’s geology and legal landscape make it a top candidate for fledgling carbon capture technologies, which the law promotes through sweetened and extended tax credits. Its existing pipeline infrastructure and energy industry work force could help with hydrogen development. And, perhaps most important, the state has plenty of people whom the Inflation Reduction Act is courting — well-heeled investors who are looking for a way to turn a profit off the green energy transition.

Nathan Wendt is hoping that Wyoming’s combination of wealthy residents, a work force primed for energy industries and local resources could make the state a magnet for clean energy investment.

The Biden administration’s climate law works by attracting private capital to clean energy. While the plan includes targeted grants, many of its potentially most significant provisions aim to transition the nation’s energy supply — and its energy work force — by luring people with capital to invest. Tax breaks and other incentives mean it’s more attractive to make financial bets on risky, but possibly transformational, green technologies.
That has Mr. Wendt and other climate researchers across the state looking at Jackson, a town full of potential investors who could pour money into new projects. The elite enclave nestled next to Grand Teton National Park boasts the highest-income county in the United States by some measures. And, Mr. Wendt reasons, many of its millionaires and billionaires work in financial markets but decamped from big coastal cities because they loved the natural beauty that Wyoming has to offer.

They might, he figures, have both the money and the motivation to make local climate investment a reality.

“Teton County has been historically disconnected from the wider Wyoming economic story,” Mr. Wendt said on a late August morning in Jackson’s town square, a few yards away from an arch made of elk antlers and a few hundred yards away from a number of wealth management offices. “We’re trying to bridge that gap.”

It’s not just Mr. Wendt who has sensed a profit opportunity. Investors and companies across the country have taken notice. Just since August, about 150 corporations have talked about the Inflation Reduction Act during investor presentations, based on Bloomberg transcripts.
In fact, interest has exceeded expectations. The Congressional Budget Office had at one point forecast that energy and climate outlays tied to the law would total about $391 billion from 2022 to 2031, with more than 60 percent of that coming from claims for various tax credits.
But Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that the total could be three times that amount, as people and businesses make much heavier use of the incentives than the government expected. That could mean that some $3 trillion pours into green energy investment over the coming decade — $1.2 trillion from the government in the form of tax credits and other incentives, matched by even more in capital from private companies. While their estimates are on the high side, other research groups and the government itself have revised their forecasts upward.

Wyoming, for its part, could be well placed to take advantage of some of the law’s more cutting-edge provisions. Some estimates have suggested that the state could see the largest per capita investment related to the legislation of any state in the nation.
The opportunities are linked to both local policies and local resources, said Scott Quillinan, the senior director of research for the School of Energy Resources at the University of Wyoming.
For instance, the law incentivizes hydrogen development with a new tax credit, making it a much cheaper potential fuel. Wyoming already has pipeline and rail networks that could help transport hydrogen mixtures, Mr. Quillinan said.
The law also expanded a tax credit for what is known as direct carbon sequestration, the process of removing carbon from the air and storing it underground or turning it into new products. Wyoming is home to spongelike rocks filled with pockets of saltwater, which are ideal for storing captured carbon. It is also easier to get the necessary permits to set up such projects in Wyoming than in many other states.
And while it used to be difficult to make cost-intensive direct capture projects pencil out, the law changed that, increasing the credit for directly captured carbon stored in saline rock formations to $180 per ton from $50.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“The incentives finally make these investments profitable,” said Michele Della Vigna, a researcher at Goldman.
Environmentalists sometimes question both hydrogen and direct carbon capture technologies, in part because they’re relatively untested. But since the law’s passage last year, announcements of carbon capture projects — including a large one in Wyoming — have spiked.
Project Bison, a carbon capture facility under development by the firm CarbonCapture, is set to be the biggest project of its kind, and big names like BCG and Microsoft have signed on for its carbon removal credits.
Jonas Lee, CarbonCapture’s chief commercial officer, said that, without the law, the project would most likely have been smaller and slower moving. Even with the law’s help, its planned opening this year has been delayed. Mr. Lee did not provide a reason or a new opening date, but said the firm still expected to operate at scale.
Rusty Bell, the director of the Office of Economic Transformation at the Gillette College Foundation in Wyoming, thinks the administration’s climate push is destined for such hiccups. New technologies take time to roll out. The maze of incentives and grants on offer can be difficult to navigate.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
But Mr. Bell, who wrote the opinion essay with Mr. Wendt, also says Campbell County, where he is based, recognizes that its future as a coal-producing area will hinge partly on seizing new technologies. Residents can look at flailing coal communities elsewhere and realize “we don’t want to be like that in 10, 15, 20 years,” he said.

2023-10-01,"Young people in West African capitals wave the flags at protests or as they race through cities on motorcycles. Tailors sew dozens of them a day in the narrow alleys of buzzing markets. Taxi drivers put them on their dashboards.
Among the sea of flags flying high in a burst of patriotic fervor in Burkina Faso, Mali and lately Niger, countries that have recently undergone military coups, the red, white and blue flag of the Russian Federation has become commonplace. While it carries political overtones, it has emerged as a trendy accessory, much like a Che Guevara illustration a generation ago in the West.
“Stylish,” Nana Fidaous said about the loose outfit made with Russia’s colors that she had donned at a recent pro-military demonstration in Niger’s capital, Niamey. A high school student, Ms. Fidaous said she wasn’t sure about the symbolic meaning of wearing Russia’s colors. But she said it was time to learn more about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and what he could bring to Niger, which has been squeezed by sanctions and border closures by its West African neighbors in the wake of the coup.
As Russia has made inroads in some West and Central African countries, its flag has been the most visible sign of a broader geopolitical shift in the region, along with Russian weapons and mercenaries.

“The Russian flag has become a symbol of resistance in West Africa, affiliated with anti-West and anti-French attitudes,” said Kyle Walter, the head of research at Logically, a technology company that tracked an increase of pro-Russian and anti-French narratives related to Niger in the wake of a coup there this summer.
How so many Russian flags have ended up so easily in West African capitals has been a matter of speculation among analysts and some Western diplomats who track the flags’ origin, convinced that the Russian government has financed their distribution to spread its influence. And there is some evidence that the Kremlin has done so.

Ahmed Bello, the president of a Nigerien civil society group called PARADE, said that he distributed up to 70 Russian flags at each protest in Niamey and that his work was funded by the Russian government through intermediaries conducting similar operations in Mali.
“It is with them that we work to develop the expansion of Russian ideology in Africa,” he said. Microsoft has identified PARADE as a creation of Russia’s Foreign Ministry, and a senior European military official said on condition of anonymity that the group was a front for Kremlin-backed operations on the continent.

Mr. Bello said he had begun sending flags to other cities across Niger. At a meeting earlier this year with Russia’s ambassador to Mali, Igor Gromyko, Mr. Bello said the ambassador had discussed how Russia could finance his activities in exchange for Mr. Bello’s help with promoting the opening of a Russian embassy in Niger.
The Russian Embassy in Mali did not respond to a request for comment.
But in Niger, there is no mistaking the role that fashion plays in the flag’s popularity.
“They just look so cool,” Rédouane Halidou, 21, said as he visited a tiny tailor workshop in a residential neighborhood of Niamey one morning. Two freshly sewn polo shirts were displayed on a table, one in Niger’s green, white and orange, another in Russia’s red, white and blue.

Russian flags and flag-themed shirts mean good business for tailors, according to half a dozen of them who have sold hundreds of pieces: A miniature flag for a car costs 80 cents. Shirts made with Russia’s national colors are sold for $3, and the largest flags go for as much as $6.

“Everyone makes them now,” said Amadou Issa, a tailor who manages five workshops and dozens of employees in Niamey. As he completed a large Russian flag on a recent afternoon, he said he and his teams had sewn hundreds of Russian flags since the coup.
They also make a catchy political statement. Russia is seen by many young Africans as an anticolonial power, there to help them cast off their colonial past and write a new chapter of national history that has nothing to do with democracy, which many associate with exploitative partnerships with Western countries, corruption and poverty.
After military rulers in Niger ousted the civilian president in late July, a wave of pro-Russian sentiment spread throughout the capital, coupled with widespread anger against France, Niger’s former colonizer and a longtime security ally. France’s ambassador to Niger left  on Wednesday. French troops positioned in the country are set to depart by the end of the year.

As hopes for economic opportunities and social progress under partnerships with France and the West have dwindled, an appetite for strongman rule has grown — a box that West African military leaders, allied with an autocrat like Mr. Putin, tick.

“It’s a release of frustration,” said Ousseina Alidou, a Nigerien professor of linguistics and cultural studies at Rutgers University. “The youth is waiting. They’re demanding change so something happens in their lives, but there’s no prospect of employment.”
So far, the enthusiasm for Russia has yet to translate into political influence for Moscow in Niger. As in other countries in the region, Russia’s economic and humanitarian involvement is dwarfed here by infrastructure projects, aid and security partnerships with Western countries, China and Turkey.
At a recent news conference with Niger’s junta-appointed prime minister last month, a journalist from Russia Today, the Kremlin-owned television network, asked if the Russian flags seen on Niamey’s streets could prompt the country’s authorities to seek a partnership with Russia.
The prime minister, Ali Lamine Zeine, smiled and shook his head. Nigerien journalists laughed.
Yet the sudden surge of Russian flags on Niamey’s streets has echoed similar phenomena in neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali, where military-led governments seized power in coups in recent years and then allied with Russia for military cooperation.

Whether Niger’s new leaders might follow that path, after years of cooperation with Western allies like the United States and European countries, is unclear. But the ground seems to be quite fertile, helped by social media campaigns and pro-Russian groups like PARADE.

El Hadj Bagué, the owner of a grocery shop at a market in central Niamey, said he “used to hate President Vladimir Putin because of his invasion of Ukraine.” But the president’s friendly attitude toward Africa, which he said he had learned about on social media, changed his views.

Mr. Bagué said his four children call Mr. Putin “Baba,” or Dad.
In Niamey, tailors said they would keep sewing flags as long as the demand was there. Amid the clanking sounds of sewing machines, Abdoulaziz Ali Ahmane said he had sewn dozens of the flags free “out of patriotic duty.”
“Niger’s and Russia’s flags go hand in hand now,” he said, greeting patrons in a large garment made of a Nigerien flag on one half, and a Russian flag on the other.

Donald Trump appeared today at the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan for the first day of his fraud trial. The case, brought by New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, kicks off an unprecedented stretch in which the former president will run for the nation’s highest office while facing a series of civil and criminal trials.
In this case, James is accusing Trump of inflating his riches by billions of dollars and crossing from hyperbole into fraud. In some years, the attorney general’s office contends, Trump, his adult sons and their family business inflated his riches by more than $2 billion so that they could secure favorable terms on loans from banks.
The charges are civil, not criminal — meaning that Trump faces serious financial penalties, but not prison time. However, my colleague Ben Protess said that the case imperils his company and threatens his image as a master of the business world.
“This is a case that strikes at his public persona as a successful businessman, someone who is not just a billionaire but a billionaire many times over,” Ben said. “Any undermining of that identity is something that really rubs him the wrong way.”

Outside the courtroom today, Trump said the case against him was “a witch hunt” and fired a fusillade of personal attacks on James and the judge overseeing the case, even suggesting that they were criminals. Inside, however, lawyers for the state methodically cast doubt on the value of Trump’s signature properties, including Trump Tower in Manhattan.
The trial is expected to last several weeks. If the attorney general’s office proves its case, the judge could impose a $250 million penalty and bar him from operating a business in New York."
2023-10-03,"This article is from a special report on the Athens Democracy Forum, which gathered experts last week in the Greek capital to discuss global issues.
Moderator: Steven Erlanger, Europe-based diplomatic correspondent for The New York Times
Participants: Nanna-Louise Wildfang Linde, vice president of European governmental affairs for Microsoft; and Dr. Benedikt Franke, vice chairman and chief executive, Munich Security Conference
Excerpts from the panel Rethinking Security: When Threats are Invisible have been edited and condensed.
STEVEN ERLANGER The topic before us is cybercrime and we’ll get to that, but first I wanted to talk to Nanna-Louise about what’s in the backdrop of almost all our conversations, which is the war in Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and that in that war there’s a secret war we don’t see which, is the war of cyberattacks and disinformation. Nanna, I know your company, Microsoft, but also Google and others, have been working with the Ukrainian government to try to help it defend itself. So I wondered if you could just tell us a little bit about the nature of that threat.
NANNA-LOUISE WILDFANG LINDE I think it’s appropriate to start with the war in Ukraine. It’s something that we’ve been engaged in very actively from the start, even before, because of all the signals — 65 trillion signals — that we analyze every day to make sure that our customers are safe, we have certain insights and information that governments don’t have. So we saw early on that something was going on in Ukraine and we collaborated with the Ukrainian government and gave them the information that we had.
We’ve been very open about that. We have issued a transparency report about everything that we’ve seen and everything that we have worked with the government around seeing — 600 attacks on 100 different government and nongovernment organizations in Ukraine — and what we’ve also been able to do is to see when there will be a physical attack. So this has been very helpful — that we have been able to see some patterns, not only when would there come a new cyberattack and help the Ukrainian government prevent that, but also when will the next physical attack happen.

LINDE Not in the same extensive way, but we do work with governments all over the world.
ERLANGER Are these political choices made by Microsoft? I mean do you just decide, “Well I think this country is a good country so I’m going to help it and this country is a bad country.”
LINDE This was a little bit of a unique decision to help so extensively in Ukraine. We helped also on many other parameters. We have helped them combat the misinformation and this is also something we do in other countries. But something that’s also unique to Ukraine is the work that we’ve done together with the International Court of Justice to ensure documentation for war crimes so that we’re using our A.I. technology and collaborating with a company that does satellite images so that we can analyze them with our A.I. systems and thereby see exactly how does this building look before and after. Let’s talk about when did that attack happen with the civilians inside and so on.
ERLANGER I suppose you can look at places that were fields that are now gravesites or something like that.
LINDE Right, exactly, and I think one element of cyberdefense work that I think is important to get across is there’s of course a race between those that want to use cyber as a weapon and then cyberdefense technology. The same with A.I. Some will use A.I. as a weapon, some will use A.I. as a tool, and what we’ve learned from the war in Ukraine is that the defensive technology has by far won over the offense technology and this is one reason that we were able to work closely together with government and private companies.
ERLANGER Benedikt, how afraid should we be of this cybersecurity world? I mean are you as confident as Nanna-Louise that the defenses are superior to the attackers?
FRANKE I think that’s the wrong question because we are already scared. We did a little polling ahead of the last Munich Security Conference asking a thousand people in every European country, are you scared when it comes to cybersecurity, what do you feel most threatened by, and you know three results sort of stand out. Seventy-eight percent of Europeans are massively concerned about increasing attacks on them in their function as the smallest but also the most vulnerable building blocks of democracy. I mean we’re at the Athens Democracy Forum here that’s really at the core of their worry that they feel already that they are targeted not only for their money and not only for scams but also because they are the building blocks of democracy and through them you can turn democracy on its head, you can break it up. So 78 percent are concerned about that massively. Ninety-six percent of Europeans that we surveyed are concerned about the inability of their national governments and the European Union to protect them. They have a much higher faith in companies to protect them than they have in their governments. Europeans aren’t quite sure about the U.S. component of that. There are a good 60 percent who are worried about having their data stored outside the European Union, that are worried about the U.S. government’s intent. You know in Germany we still talk about Angela Merkel’s mobile phone being hacked by the U.S. government. No hard feelings, but it’s still a thing. And the A.I. component is massively complicating the picture because it’s so diffuse, so nebulous, people just can’t wrap their heads around it.
And there are three things that we believe need to be done. We’re really bad at aligning tech regulation with security considerations. We need to get much better at aligning the trans-Atlantic tech agendas. If it’s true that 60 percent of Europeans are worried about the U.S. component that’s almost as many as are worried about the North Koreans and the Russians. And we need to work on that and then strengthen societal resilience.

LINDE I think there’s one more thing we need to do, if I can add one to your list. In this world we live in, we need norms. One thing that was really great after World War II in 1949 was that the world came together and adopted the Geneva Convention which really spells out how to protect civilians in times of war and I think we should really think hard about whether we could do something like that. How states can act against each other when it comes to cyberspace — so like a Geneva Convention on digital."
2023-10-04,
2023-10-05,"In February, on the night of this year’s Grammy Awards, the pianist, producer and composer Robert Glasper was enjoying himself in the audience at the Microsoft Theater when he realized he didn’t have his phone. He had given it to his assistant earlier in the evening, before taking the stage to accept the award for best R&B album — his second win in that category and fifth career Grammy.
When he retrieved the phone, Glasper saw that it was filled with messages about the R&B singer Chris Brown, who was among the nominees whom he had just bested. Brown had reacted to the loss with a discourteous post to his 131 million followers on Instagram: “Who the [expletive] is Robert Glasper,” appending a crying laughing emoji to the word “who.”
The comment, which Brown followed with a video comparing his success on the record charts to Glasper’s, was an attempt to undercut his rival’s achievement. But Brown had fallen into a trap. Over the previous 10 years, Glasper had been methodically chipping away at the boundaries between jazz — the music for which he originally became known — hip-hop and R&B. In some ways, his winning album, “Black Radio III,” was designed to force precisely the kind of showdown with contemporary Black popular music that Brown’s intemperate posting had unwittingly supplied.
Scrolling through his phone at the venue, Glasper was almost giddy.
“Oh yeah,” he thought to himself. “This is going to be great.”

Glasper, 45, whose long face and soft features are capped by closely trimmed hair, ascended the ranks of modern jazz nearly 20 years ago. Born and raised in Houston, he arrived in New York to study at the New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music in 1997, right as the neo-soul movement, pioneered by artists like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu, was integrating jazz instrumentation and vocal performance into a chart-topping variant of R&B.
At the New School, Glasper befriended the singer Bilal, a member of a loose musicians collective called the Soulquarians with D’Angelo, Badu, the producer J Dilla, and the rappers Common, Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def) and Talib Kweli, among others. The group shared recording space at Electric Lady Studios and occasionally attended concerts together. At the same time, Glasper was getting an education in the world of straight-ahead jazz while playing piano in bands led by Christian McBride and Russell Malone — both took him on tour, at the expense of his attendance record — and forming his own acoustic trio.

His first album, “Mood” (2004) and two follow-ups for Blue Note Records, “Canvas” (2005) and “In My Element” (2007), hewed largely traditional, with an occasional nod to hip-hop, as on the “In My Element” track “J Dillalude.” But by the release of his fourth album, “Double Booked” (2009) — half featuring the Robert Glasper Trio and half featuring a new electric fusion ensemble called “The Robert Glasper Experiment” — Glasper’s inner Soulquarian was edging into view.
“Real jazz is supposed to reflect the times you’re in; that’s the true history and tradition of the music,” he said. “I’m not supposed to sound like Thelonious Monk did when I have so much more music to be influenced by.”

The “Black Radio” series, which Glasper described as a distillation of his brand, made breathing room for those influences. The first album, released in 2012, featured several of his neo-soul compatriots — Badu, Bilal, Musiq Soulchild — as well as rapping from Lupe Fiasco and Bey, with covers of songs by David Bowie and Nirvana thrown in for good measure.
“Black Radio” earned Glasper his first Grammy Award (for best R&B album) and set him on a collision course with popular culture not seen from a jazz musician this century. He played piano on several tracks of Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 album, “To Pimp a Butterfly,” released a remix album with the house music producer Kaytranada and was recruited by the actor Don Cheadle to compose the score for “Miles Ahead,” a 2015 biopic of Miles Davis.
“He has that desire to get to the next level,” said Common, who appeared on “Black Radio 2” (2013) and formed the group August Greene with Glasper and the drummer/producer Karriem Riggins. “He wants to be the one that people will look to and say, ‘Yeah, he was the greatest of that time.’”
Last month, Glasper arrived at a recording studio in Downtown Brooklyn to work on his latest film score, for a documentary about Luther Vandross, one of his mother’s favorite artists. “The first time I fell in love with acoustic piano wasn’t Duke Ellington, or Monk, or Herbie — it was Luther,” he said, crediting Nat Adderley Jr., Vandross’s longtime pianist and arranger. His large frame was draped in a black T-shirt with a portrait of Dilla, whose idiosyncratic production style inspired a generation of hip-hop and jazz musicians before and after his death in 2006.
“Watching him work changed the way I play,” Glasper said.
A couple of days after the session, Glasper would fly to Johannesburg for nearly two weeks to play festival dates. He is also working on a Christmas EP and composing another film score, for a documentary about Billy Preston. On Wednesday, back in New York, he began his annual, monthlong residency at the Blue Note Jazz club, colloquially known as “Robtoberfest.” The residency (and a related festival in Napa Valley) unites his extended universe of friends and forebears in one setting. It has become known for drawing A-list surprise performers (Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock are fans) and, this year, will mix tributes to giants like Herbie Hancock and Art Blakey with featured performances from Bey, Norah Jones, Yebba, D Smoke, Terrace Martin and Kamasi Washington, among others.

Glasper finds scoring films a welcome challenge. “Ease can be a bad thing, and making my own music, a lot of times, is easy,” he said.

“It’s a reflection of his unique contribution to music,” said Alex Kurland, the director of programming at the Blue Note. “He enables everyone around him to sound great and to feel great.”

Since the pandemic, Glasper has lived full time in Los Angeles. He got an apartment there in 2017 on the suggestion of Martin (with whom he, Washington and the producer 9th Wonder perform as Dinner Party) and to be closer to the film business. He composed the music for the 2020 film “The Photograph,” starring Issa Rae and LaKeith Stanfield, and for the television series “Run the World,” “The Best Man: The Final Chapters” and “Winning Time.” (He has also appeared in front of the camera, including in a small role on Showtime’s “Black Monday,” the since-canceled series Cheadle starred in and executive produced.)
Of his many jobs, Glasper said he finds scoring the most challenging. It requires two acts of translation — from image to sound, and from director to composer — for which his background as an artist provided little preparation.
“Directors will ask you to do weird things: ‘I need this to feel melancholy — but in a calypso way,’” he said, laughing. “But it’s good exercise. Ease can be a bad thing, and making my own music, a lot of times, is easy.”
During the pandemic, he was inspired to make “Black Radio III” in part because his usual, “easy,” recording methods were unavailable to him. Instead of inviting musicians to jam live in a studio, he worked more like a hip-hop producer, crafting beats and soliciting vocal performances remotely. The result — featuring, among many others, H.E.R., Ty Dolla Sign and, on a special edition produced in partnership with the streetwear label Supreme, Mac Miller — is the most accessible and thoroughly modern music Glasper has released.
Even Chris Brown eventually had to pay his respects. The day after his viral Grammys outburst, the singer posted a public apology: “After doing my research I actually think your amazing,” he wrote.
Glasper gladly accepted — and quickly printed “Who the [expletive] is Robert Glasper?” on T-shirts."

A potential takeover of the shale oil giant Pioneer would be Exxon Mobil’s biggest deal in 25 years.

DeSean McClinton-Holland for The New York Times
Blockbuster M.&A. may be back
Reports that Exxon Mobil is near a $60 billion takeover of the shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources — in what would be the biggest deal of the year — are the latest sign that cash-flush corporate titans are once again willing to buy growth. (The reports caution that talks between Exxon and Pioneer are continuing and may not lead to a transaction.)
Moreover, they’re likely willing to confront President Biden’s antitrust regulators in doing so.
A Pioneer deal would transform the U.S. oil industry, which had been riding high off a surge in crude prices. (The oil market has gotten bumpier lately; more on that below.) Exxon’s profits climbed to a record $59 billion last year and its cash hoard grew to nearly $29.5 billion. Buying Pioneer, the largest player in the oil-rich Permian Basin in the southwestern U.S., would help Exxon produce 1.3 million barrels a day in the region, more than the entire output of many OPEC countries.
Analysts and deal makers have speculated that industry consolidation was coming. Investors increasingly favor fat dividends and stock buybacks over funding cash-intensive expeditions for new sources of crude, leaving M.&A. as one of the few ways such companies could grow. Pioneer itself spent $11 billion on acquisitions two years ago. Pioneer shares were up more than 10 percent in premarket trading, while Exxon’s stock was down more than 2 percent.
It would also show major oil companies doubling down on their traditional business, despite pressure to spend more on greener energy. Exxon has said it will invest $17 billion through 2027 in carbon-capture technologies, a plan that includes buying Denbury, a carbon pipeline operator, for $4.9 billion — but has made clear that its focus is on the oil patch.
Business leaders are also getting more comfortable with the economic landscape. Deal makers say that confidence to do big transactions is growing as the outlook for interest rates and the job market becomes clearer. Such deals would revive a moribund M.&A. market, where the $2 trillion worth of activity in the first nine months of 2023 represents the lowest level for that time period in a decade, according to LSEG.
Already this year, Pfizer agreed to pay $43 billion to acquire the cancer drug maker Seagen, and Cisco announced a $28 billion takeover to buy the data-analysis provider Splunk, its largest-ever takeover. (Pioneer would be Exxon’s biggest deal since buying Mobil for $80 billion in 1998.)

Companies also appear less worried about antitrust scrutiny, despite the F.T.C. and the Justice Department threatening to oppose corporate consolidation. Privately, business leaders say that they are feeling emboldened after the F.T.C. struggled to block Microsoft’s $70 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Donald Trump endorses Jim Jordan for House speaker. The former president’s backing of the combative and staunch conservative may give the Ohio lawmaker a leg up over his main rival for the position, Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Still, both Jordan and Scalise face skepticism from moderates in their party; House lawmakers are set to vote for speaker next week.
An FTX co-founder says that Sam Bankman-Fried committed fraud. Gary Wang, who is cooperating with federal prosecutors, testified at Bankman-Fried’s trial yesterday that they gave special privileges to Alameda Research, an FTX-affiliated trading firm accused of stealing billions worth of customer funds from the exchange, and lied about it. (Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty.) Meanwhile, an FTX programmer said that Bankman-Fried appeared worried about the exchange’s debt last summer, telling him that “we’re not bulletproof.”
Stocks and bonds are up modestly ahead of today’s jobs report. Economists are forecasting that the nonfarm payrolls report, due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, will show that employers added roughly 170,000 jobs last month, a fall from August. Investors will be focused on wage data for insight into the Fed’s next policy move.
MGM Resorts says a cyberattack cost it $100 million. The casino operator refused to pay a ransom when hackers targeted its systems last month, crippling its properties in Las Vegas and elsewhere, according to The Wall Street Journal. A rival, Caesars, is said to have paid a $15 million ransom after a similar incident this summer.

An oil price reversal
An abrupt turnaround in oil prices has quieted a chorus of predictions that crude would soon top $100 a barrel. The apparent culprit: slowing global demand.
Brent crude, the global benchmark, is trading at around $84 a barrel this morning, and is on pace for its worst weekly decline since March, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in an investor note this morning. Brent is down roughly 13 percent since surpassing $96 a barrel on Sept. 27.

Musk’s latest clash with the S.E.C.
The S.E.C. is taking on Elon Musk again. The agency is suing the tech mogul to force him to testify as it investigates whether he broke securities laws in rapidly accumulating shares in Twitter ahead of his $44 billion takeover last year of the social media platform, now named X.
S.E.C. rules require investors who acquire more than 5 percent of a publicly traded company to disclose that within 10 days. Musk amassed 9 percent of Twitter between January and April last year, but was late in filing a disclosure form. Musk was subpoenaed to testify last month about his stock purchases, but he “failed to appear,” the S.E.C. said in a filing yesterday.

It’s not the only Twitter suit Musk faces. A Manhattan federal judge recently denied Musk’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit contending that he defrauded former Twitter shareholders by failing to disclose his share purchases in a timely manner. Shareholders’ rights around such matters have taken on new significance with the Supreme Court deciding to hear a case about how delayed corporate disclosures affect investors.
The legal bar is fairly low for the S.E.C. The agency needs only to prove that Musk was late with his disclosure. Recent fines for such penalties have maxed out in the hundreds of thousand of dollars, Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School, told DealBook.
Conversely, she said, the plaintiffs in the New York suit would need to prove intent. “The private plaintiffs have a much higher penalty, but they have a lot of hoops to jump through before they get there,” Lipton said.

Musk’s brushes with the S.E.C. go back years. In a settlement with the agency, Musk and Tesla agreed to create a roughly $42 million fund to reimburse Tesla shareholders after he tweeted in 2018 that he had “funding secured” for a potential buyout of the company.
In other Musk news: Linda Yaccarino, X’s C.E.O., reportedly told the company’s lenders that advertisers had returned to the platform, but were spending less money. It also plans to introduce an expanded monthly subscription plan to generate more revenue.

Since taking the top job in February, Tucker has sought to refocus on business news and the paper’s digital audience, and has jettisoned senior editors.
Chip makers push back on China rules
When the Biden administration passed the CHIPS Act a year ago, American chip makers seemed to accept restrictions designed to stymie the sale of advanced semiconductor technology to China. But as the White House looks to impose new limits, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel are pushing back to save their China businesses, write the Times’s Tripp Mickle, David McCabe and Ana Swanson.
China is a huge market for chips. The three companies make more than $50 billion in combined annual revenue in the country, which represents about a third of the global semiconductor market. They warn that depriving them of that revenue would hurt their ability to innovate, making it harder for the U.S. to develop its domestic chip-making industry.

The companies’ C.E.O.s are lobbying Washington. In July, Pat Gelsinger of Intel, Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm met with Antony Blinken, the secretary of state; Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary; and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, to talk about their worries. (Intel is said to have questioned whether national security officials understood semiconductor technology, a claim the company denied.)
Nvidia has also tried to influence key think tanks. Hackles were raised in Washington over concerns that the company tried to sideline the director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who supports export restrictions. Nvidia said it hadn’t acted “improperly.”
National security experts and some lawmakers aren’t happy. They point out that the White House committed $50 billion to the industry when it passed the CHIPS Act, to bolster chip making at home. The House committee on competition with China is weighing whether to question the companies over their compliance with export controls.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Wall Street awaits a report on consumer prices. The Commerce Department will shortly release the Consumer Price Index data for September. Economists expect that “core” C.P.I., which strips out food and fuel, rose by 4.1 percent on an annual basis, the smallest increase in two years. High numbers could stoke concerns that the Fed will raise interest rates to tamp down inflation, though many investors are betting it won’t.
Jes Staley, Barclays’s former C.E.O., is banned from Britain’s financial industry. The punishment by the country’s Financial Conduct Authority, which also includes a fine of £1.5 million ($1.8 million), was for misleading the regulator and the bank over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Though Staley publicly played down his ties to the disgraced financier and sex offender, he privately described Epstein as one of his “most cherished” friends.
Goldman Sachs sues Malaysia over a 1MDB settlement. The Wall Street giant sought to take the country’s government to arbitration amid efforts by Malaysian leaders to alter the agreement, which ended an investigation into the bank’s role in a sprawling foreign bribery case. Separately, Goldman sold its GreenSky lending unit at a loss as it seeks to pare down its consumer-finance operations.
Republicans narrowly back Steve Scalise for House speaker. The representative from Louisiana beat Jim Jordan of Ohio in a vote among Republican lawmakers. But a plan to put the decision to a vote in the full House on Thursday was delayed after some of Jordan’s supporters said they wouldn’t back Scalise without concessions.
The U.A.W. expands its strike against Ford. The autoworkers union said its members would walk off the job at a Kentucky plant that makes some of the company’s most profitable models, including a version of the F-Series pickup and the Ford Expedition S.U.V. Separately, negotiators for Hollywood studios suspended negotiations with the SAG-AFTRA actors union, calling its latest demands “untenable.”

Calls for calm at colleges over Israel-Gaza comments
American college campuses have become a flashpoint since war broke out between Israel and Hamas, with business leaders calling out university leaders and students. On Wednesday, Marc Rowan, the C.E.O. of the financial giant Apollo, demanded that the chair and the president of the University of Pennsylvania resign, saying they had tolerated antisemitism.
But other prominent figures — including the former Treasury secretary Larry Summers, who was among the first to rebuke Harvard for being slow to condemn the Hamas attacks — sought to ease tensions in academia over the matter, even as the financier Bill Ackman insisted that the names of students who signed a statement blaming Israel for the violence should be made public.

Rowan urged Penn donors to “close their checkbooks” in protest, until Elizabeth Magill, the university’s president, and Scott Bok, the chair of its board of trustees, step down. Rowan, who gave $50 million to the school in 2018, cited its hosting of the Palestine Writes literature festival last month and Magill’s failure to condemn what he said were antisemitic comments made at the event.
At least one fellow prominent donor has joined Rowan’s call: Dick Wolf, the television producer, who said Magill and Bok “should be held to account.”
The dean of N.Y.U.’s law school repudiated a student’s comments blaming Israel for the attacks, the same day that the law firm Winston & Strawn withdrew a job offer it hade made to the student. (Ryna Workman, the president of the school’s Student Bar Association, had written in the group’s bulletin that “this regime of state-sanctioned violence created the conditions that made resistance necessary.”)
Fallout at Harvard over a student-written letter continues. Several groups that signed the statement, which held Israel “entirely responsible” for the attacks, retracted their support.

Some prominent figures are urging leniency for the students. Summers likened such naming-and-shaming to McCarthyism. “I think Bill is getting a bit carried away,” Summers told Bloomberg, referring to Ackman. Jason Furman, a former Obama administration official and economics professor at Harvard, joined Summers in condemning calls to punish the students. He wrote on X that “two wrongs do not make a right.”
In related news: Linda Yaccarino, the C.E.O. of X, outlined the social network’s efforts to remove hateful speech and misinformation on its platform, in response to criticism from the European Union. The E.U. also gave Mark Zuckerberg of Meta 24 hours to respond to similar concerns. And UBS has barred employees from work-related travel in the Middle East.
Caroline, M.B.S. and a Chinese bribe
After two days of bombshell testimony in the fraud trial of the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison will be questioned by his defense lawyers on Thursday.
The highlights of Ellison’s testimony Wednesday included the falsifying of business documents, an attempt to court Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, as an emergency investor and paying a “large bribe” to China.
Bankman-Fried, the 31-year-old founder of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and Alameda Research, a hedge fund that Ellison ran, faces criminal fraud charges tied to the implosion of the companies, which cost customers, investors and lenders billions. He has pleaded not guilty.
Ellison, Bankman-Fried’s top adviser and a former girlfriend, is cooperating with the prosecution and is the state’s star witness.

Ellison said she and Bankman-Fried repeatedly lied to customers and business partners. She repeated accusations that Bankman-Fried directed her to plunder customers’ deposits to pay lenders, and she blamed him for the firms’ downfall.
A damning accusation: that he ordered her to create bogus balance sheets which concealed billions in losses. One falsified document was given to Genesis, a crypto firm that was one of FTX’s biggest lenders. “I didn’t want to be dishonest, but I also didn’t want them to know the truth,” Ellison said.
Other revelations from Ellison:
In 2021, the firm had to pay off Chinese officials to reclaim $1 billion in Alameda funds that had been frozen on Chinese exchanges during one of Beijing’s crypto crackdowns. A previous failed attempt to unfreeze the money had involved setting up trading accounts in the names of “Thai prostitutes.”
Seeking a lifeline, Bankman-Fried made a push for Saudi money. He succeeded in getting Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and an FTX investor, to arrange a dinner with the crown prince last year. Bloomberg notes that Prince Mohammed has never been listed as an investor in FTX.

Birkenstock stumbles
Despite high hopes, 2023 is not looking like a comeback year for I.P.O.s. Birkenstock, the German sandal maker, was the latest to make a dud of a debut as its shares tumbled on Wednesday.

The U.S. listing fell short of expectations. The stock closed down almost 13 percent, giving the company a market capitalization of $7.6 billion. That’s more than the 4 billion euros that L Catterton, the private equity firm backed by Bernard Arnault’s LVMH, paid for the company three years ago. But it’s the worst trading debut for a U.S. listing of this size since 2021, according to Bloomberg.
Birkenstock was the fourth big I.P.O. in a month. Arm, the SoftBank-backed chip designer; the grocery delivery company Instacart; and Klaviyo, a marketing software firm, have all seen their shares slide since they went public in New York.
LVMH results may have spooked investors. The parent group of Tiffany and Givenchy reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales this week. Given Birkenstock’s reliance on Europe, that would “inevitably” hit sentiment, Javier Gonzalez Lastra of the Tema Luxury exchange-traded fund told Barron’s.
Can Birkenstock regain its buzz? The 249-year-old brand, long known as utilitarian and uncool, has had a fashion upgrade in the last decade — a catwalk appearance at the 2012 Paris fashion week and a “Barbie” movie cameo this summer have helped. Arnault’s golden touch might also be useful: Financière Agache, the Arnault family investment company, agreed to buy up to $325 million in Birkenstock shares, and Alexandre, one of Arnault’s sons, will join its board.
But the experience of two other shoe brands that went public holds a warning: AllBirds and Dr. Martens both had bumper debuts, only for investors to sour on the stocks.

2023-10-13,"British regulators on Friday gave final approval to Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, the last major obstacle for a deal that at one point seemed to be falling apart because of government objections on both sides of the Atlantic.
Britain’s antitrust agency, the Competition and Markets Authority, said it signed off on the deal after Microsoft agreed to license to a rival a part of Activision’s business associated with so-called cloud gaming, a small but promising new area for the industry. The C.M.A. was the last regulator that needed to approve the deal before it could be finalized.
The approval is a major victory for Microsoft, which has spent nearly two years fighting objections in the United States and Britain. In July, the company won a court case against the Federal Trade Commission, which had tried to block the deal. And after British authorities said they would block the acquisition in April, Microsoft was able to convince them to reverse course, a rare occurrence for the C.M.A.
Microsoft and Activision are expected to complete the transaction in the coming days.
“The C.M.A. is resolute in its determination to prevent mergers that harm competition and deliver bad outcomes for consumers and businesses,” said Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the antitrust agency. “We delivered a clear message to Microsoft that the deal would be blocked unless they comprehensively addressed our concerns and stuck to our guns on that.”

The acquisition is the largest consumer technology deal since AOL bought Time Warner two decades ago, and it will combine Microsoft’s Xbox business with the world’s largest game publisher. Activision publishes titles such as “Call of Duty,” “Candy Crush,” and “World of Warcraft.”
“We have now crossed the final regulatory hurdle to close this acquisition, which we believe will benefit players and the gaming industry worldwide,” Brad Smith, the vice chair and president of Microsoft, said in a statement.
Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said he and his colleagues “look forward to becoming part of the Xbox team.”
Microsoft’s ability to push past the regulatory concerns shows the limits of government efforts to crimp the power of the world’s largest tech companies. First announced in January 2022, the acquisition was seen as a test of whether regulators could block a tech megamerger amid concerns about the industry’s growing economic might and societal influence.
Microsoft made a number of concessions to win approval. The company said it would not block Activision titles from being available for rival consoles such as Sony’s PlayStation.

To assuage concerns from British authorities, the company agreed to transfer the cloud streaming licensing rights for all current and new Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher in France.
Cloud gaming is still a very small market, but has the potential to be a major area of growth for the industry because the technology allows people to stream games on phones, tablets and other devices, diminishing the need for traditional consoles.
The arrangement is seen as preventing Microsoft from using Activision titles to give its cloud-gaming service an advantage over rival offerings. The structure will last for 15 years and apply to all markets except for the European Union, which approved the deal without the cloud gaming concession."
2023-10-14,"A debate over how universities should address the Israel-Hamas war has compounded one of the most emotionally charged board fights in years.
It involves two of the most prominent modern figures in finance: Marc Rowan, the chief executive of Apollo and chair of the board of advisers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, and Scott Bok, the chief executive of Greenhill and chair of Penn’s trustees.
After Hamas’s terrorist attack last Saturday, Rowan called for Bok and Penn’s president, Elizabeth Magill, to resign. Rowan denounced, among other things, the school’s decision to allow on campus, two weeks earlier, a Palestinian literature festival that he said had hosted speakers who presented antisemitic ideas. He believes the school, his alma mater, has an inconsistent approach to the values of free speech.
“Words of hate and violence must be met with clear, reasoned condemnation, rooted in morality from those in positions of authority,” Rowan wrote in an opinion piece submitted to, but not published by, Penn’s student newspaper this week.

“The academic, moral and objective truth of our elite institution was traded for a poorly organized pursuit of social justice and politically correct speech.”
Rowan told CNBC the day after his opinion piece became public that the school had asked three trustees to step down for “publicly disagreeing” with university leaders. He said he had been subtly encouraged to do the same.
Bok has said the school did not seek to force anyone to resign. It did, however, suggest that two trustees “consider voluntarily resigning” after they pursued the “extraordinarily unusual” step of soliciting support for public opposition of a decision made by leadership with “appropriate consultation,” he said. Bok and Rowan did not comment further.

The fight is the latest chapter in a continuing disagreement over what some on Wall Street say is an overly “woke” culture on college campuses that protects some groups but not others.
Alumni on Wall Street have accused Penn of protecting dangerous ideas. The literature festival sparked a letter signed by thousands of alumni, including Jeff Blau, the chief executive of the real estate firm Related, and Jay Clayton, a former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who asked for the school to “display the same forcefulness here as the University of Pennsylvania would in response to any event seeped in anti-Black racism, anti-Asian hate or anti-L.G.B.T.Q.+ bias.”
The school said at the time that it condemned antisemitism and “fiercely supports” the exchange of free ideas.

Donors are piling pressure on Bok. Rowan called for donors to send just $1 to Penn until Bok and Magill resigned. As emails, texts and chat messages have flown across Wall Street, donors have called for other means of financial pressure.
“Change your wills!!!!! Today!!!!” wrote Sharyn Frankel, a well-known nonprofit executive, in an email chain Friday that included Vornado’s Steve Roth and the hedge fund manager Doug Kass.
One financier told DealBook that he would not use Bok’s firm, Greenhill, for advisory work until Bok changed his approach. Greenhill, a publicly traded company, announced a $550 million sale to the larger Japanese bank Mizuho Group in May.

Some universities avoid taking political positions. The University of Chicago, for example, has long abided by the principles laid out by one of its professors in the 1960s, which state that taking such positions can complicate the dissemination of knowledge. But many schools have departed from this idea. And once a school takes a position on one issue, it sets a precedent about taking a position on others, said Edward Rock, a professor of law at New York University who specializes in corporate governance.
It is now very difficult for Penn to say, “‘Oh, we just uphold freedom of speech,’” he said. “Because they’ve already compromised that position.”
Rowan and Bok’s public tiff may not be the last board battle involving wider public debates. “Like any board, school trustees have the duty of overseeing the long-term health and viability of institutions,” said Charles Elson, founding director of the John Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. As schools increasingly wade into matters of public discourse, that includes their stance on those issues, Elson added.
“If universities have put themselves into the political sphere the way they have, then that’s part of the oversight,” he said. — Lauren Hirsch

Israeli start-ups volunteer their tech
Israel has long been known as “Start-Up Nation,” with innovations like USB drives, firewalls and real-time navigation apps coming out of the country of nine million. The tech industry makes up about 20 percent of its economy, and many companies are working with thinned ranks as employees are called up for military reserve duty. But they are also devoting time and resources to help those in need after the Hamas terrorist attacks.
“There is a joke right now that Israel is currently the biggest hackathon in the world,” said Uri Eliabayev, founder of Machine and Deep Learning Israel, a 35,000-member artificial intelligence community.
Normally, Eliabayev consults with companies. But since last weekend, he has also been connecting volunteers and organizations in search of expertise to work on emergency projects, apart from his day job. DealBook’s Ephrat Livni spoke with entrepreneurs in Israel about three of those projects.
Missing persons: Yuval Keshtcher, the founder and chief executive of UX Writing Hub, a tech education platform, woke up early after Hamas’s strike to sirens and the news that about 150 Israelis had been kidnapped and that hundreds had been killed. He sprang into action with a fellow entrepreneur, Stav Charkham, and built a website to serve as a searchable central repository for information about individuals who were missing. “I decided by 10 a.m. to quickly build a database because I noticed there was a lot of chaos,” Keshtcher said. “By evening it was a big database.” Now there is also an app, and developers are using the data to build other emergency applications.
Misinformation: Amid the flood of news about the conflict, a wave of doctored images, text and footage is circulating online. Regulators in Europe sent inquiries to X, Meta and TikTok demanding to know their plans to address the misinformation, and on Friday the New York attorney general sent a similar inquiry. Eliabayev said one of the primary tasks that the A.I. community in Israel had focused on was reducing deepfakes and misinformation about the war online, working on tools to more efficiently scrape the web and uncover false claims.
Testimonies: Some businesses are offering up commercial applications for use in the war effort, in addition to building new tools. The Tel Aviv-based AI21, which develops natural language process systems, created a website, remember710.com, to upload and translate evidence of wartime atrocities into English, exporting text and images in a “story” format. Yoav Shoham, a co-founder and co-chief executive of AI21, is hosting a family that fled the terror in southern Israel, and he heard some of those accounts firsthand, calling them “gut-wrenching and bloodcurdling.” He was intent on creating a record of the tragedy.

2023-10-16,"LinkedIn, the professional social networking platform owned by Microsoft, said on Monday that it would cut about 668 jobs, or roughly 3 percent of its work force.
The cuts, which affect LinkedIn’s engineering, product, talent and finance teams, is the company’s second round of layoffs this year. In May, LinkedIn laid off 716 employees worldwide and said it was reducing its business in China, citing declining demand in an uncertain job market.
LinkedIn, which has 19,500 employees across 36 offices globally, did not detail the reasons for the job cuts on Monday. In a statement, the company said it was “streamlining our decision making” and that it would continue “to invest in strategic priorities.”
A LinkedIn spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the statement. In May, Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn’s chief executive, said the company was seeing “shifts in customer behavior and slower revenue growth.”

Tech giants including Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have trimmed back their work forces this year after hiring rapidly during the pandemic. In January, Microsoft cut 10,000 jobs, or less than 5 percent of its work force, to reduce costs and refocus on priorities like artificial intelligence. More than 200,000 tech employees have been laid off in 2023, according to the layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi.
In July, LinkedIn said its revenue for the three months that ended in June had grown 5 percent from a year earlier, with annual revenue surpassing $15 billion for the first time. The rise was driven by its recruiting business, according to Microsoft’s disclosures. LinkedIn has 950 million users, a number that has increased for eight consecutive quarters.
LinkedIn, like many tech companies, has been investing in artificial intelligence. This month, it announced a suite of A.I.-powered products to help with marketing, recruiting and sales."
2023-10-17,"The Biden administration on Tuesday announced additional limits on sales of advanced semiconductors by American firms, shoring up restrictions issued last October to limit China’s progress on supercomputing and artificial intelligence.
The rules appear likely to halt most shipments of advanced semiconductors from the United States to Chinese data centers, which use them to produce models capable of artificial intelligence. More U.S. companies seeking to sell China advanced chips, or the machinery used to make them, will be required to notify the government of their plans, or obtain a special license.
To prevent the risk that advanced U.S. chips travel to China through third countries, the United States will also require chip makers to obtain licenses to ship to dozens of other countries that are subject to U.S. arms embargoes.
The Biden administration argues that China’s access to such advanced technology is dangerous because it could aid the country’s military in tasks like guiding hypersonic missiles, setting up advanced surveillance systems or cracking top-secret U.S. codes. Leading A.I. experts have warned that the technology, if not properly managed, could pose existential threats to humanity.

But artificial intelligence also has valuable commercial applications, and the tougher restrictions may affect Chinese companies that have been trying to develop A.I. chatbots like ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, or the internet giant Baidu, industry analysts said. In the longer run, the limits could also weaken China’s economy, given that A.I. is transforming industries ranging from retail to health care.
The limits also appear likely to affect sales to China of U.S. chip makers such as Nvidia, AMD and Intel. Some chip makers earn as much as a third of their revenue from Chinese buyers and spent recent months lobbying against tighter restrictions."
2023-10-18,"In its antitrust confrontation with the government, the pillar of Google’s defense has been that innovation — not restrictive contracts, backed by billions in payments to industry partners — explains its success as the giant of internet search.
Its competitive advantage, it says, is brilliant people, working tirelessly to improve its products.
Pandu Nayak, Google’s first witness in the antitrust trial that began last month, is the face of that defense.
Mr. Nayak, a vice president of search, was raised in India and graduated at the top of his class at one of that nation’s elite technical schools. He came to America, earned his Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford University and then spent seven years as a research scientist on artificial intelligence projects at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.

Nineteen years ago, Mr. Nayak joined Google and found a particularly welcoming workplace, filled with professional friends. “At the end of the day, Google is a technology company — it really values the skills that I have,” Mr. Nayak said in his testimony on Wednesday.
The computer scientist’s testimony is an attempt to rebut a central argument in the case filed by the Justice Department and 38 states and territories. Their suit claims that scale is essential to competition in search. That is, the more data from user queries a search engine collects, the more it learns to improve its service, which attracts still more users, advertisers and ad revenue. That flywheel, the suit says, is fueled by ever-increasing volumes of user data.
The government and states claim that Google locks in a huge data advantage through exclusive contracts and payments of more than $10 billion a year to Apple, Samsung and others to be the default search engine on smartphones and personal computer browsers.
A slender man with thinning gray hair, who spoke in clipped, slightly accented English, Mr. Nayak has a professorial air, and has taught graduate courses at Stanford. Much of his testimony was essentially a tutorial in search technology and its evolution, guided by a Google lawyer, Kenneth Smurzynski.
Mr. Nayak went through the long string of research advances at Google that have improved search quality, including developments in machine learning, deep learning, transformers and large language models — the technology behind A.I.-driven chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard.

The evolution Mr. Nayak traced was one in which innovations in language understanding have become increasingly important to gains in search quality, while the sheer volume of search queries has become less important.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
At one point, Mr. Nayak cited a change where using a third less data brought “no meaningful decline in search quality.” Clever software, he suggested, matters more than more data.
In testimony earlier this week, Michael Whinston, the Justice Department’s economic expert, estimated that Google’s exclusive deals blocked rivals from between a third and one half of all user search queries in the United States.
“The power of the defaults is very significant,” said Mr. Whinston, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr. Whinston based his analysis on internal documents provided by Google, Microsoft, DuckDuckGo and other search services to determine his estimate of “foreclosure rate” as a result of the Google contracts.

In his cross-examination, John Schmidtlein, Google’s lead lawyer, noted that exclusive contracts were common practice in the search business. But Mr. Whinston said the size of Google’s deals was striking.
“When you see Google paying billions and billions and billions, there has to be a reason,” he said. “That’s the first thing that, as an economist, slaps me in the face.”
In his testimony, Mr. Nayak discussed the investments Google has made in search, including amassing and constantly updating a vast index of the web, which includes hundreds of billions of documents, and employing an army of 16,000 human raters worldwide, who assess the relevance and reliability of search results.
Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department’s lead lawyer, pushed Mr. Nayak to concede that Google’s improvements in search depend on huge amounts of user data — far more than its nearest rival, Microsoft’s Bing.
Mr. Nayak acknowledged that data was crucial, but he stuck to Google’s line of defense. “Bigger is not necessarily better,” he said."
2023-10-19,"Nokia announced a major overhaul of its business on Thursday that includes slashing up to 14,000 jobs, or about 16 percent of its work force, over the next three years.
The company employs 86,000 people and said the “reset” would reduce its costs by as much as 1.2 billion euros, or roughly $1.3 billion. It made the announcement as it reported a 20 percent decline in sales and a 69 percent dive in profits in the most recent quarter, from July through September, compared with last year.
“In the face of a challenging market environment, we will reduce our cost base to protect our profitability,” the company’s chief executive, Pekka Lundmark, said in a video statement.
Nokia once led the global mobile phone market, but it quickly fell behind the iPhone, which Apple released in 2007. Nokia sold its mobile phone division to Microsoft in 2013. Since then, it has focused on selling the back-end infrastructure of telecom systems to wireless companies, cable operators and other business buyers.

Nokia said that “macroeconomic uncertainty and higher interest rates continue to pressure” its customers. The company has also been struggling after losing out on market share in 5G technology to rivals in China, said John Strand, a telecom analyst in Copenhagen. Chinese companies, led by Huawei, control nearly half the global 5G market.
Nokia halted sales in Russia in March 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the time, the company had been selling equipment to MTS, Russia’s largest telecom service provider. Documents obtained by The New York Times revealed that Nokia had been enabling a Russian surveillance system for almost a decade.
Nokia isn’t the only Western telecom group to face cuts: One of its main competitors, Sweden’s Ericsson, has also laid off thousands of employees this year because of lower demand for its products and services.
“Nokia’s problems are pretty much the same across Western operators,” Mr. Strand said. “They are hit by increasing energy prices, inflation and interest.”"

Executives are under pressure to find a response to the Israel-Hamas war that doesn’t offend employees and business partners.

A new front emerges in the corporate world
As the Israel-Hamas war stretches on — with Israeli airstrikes hitting more targets in Gaza amid calls by the U.S. and others to delay a potential ground invasion — companies are finding themselves increasingly tangled in the conflict’s complex politics.
Businesses across the corporate world are seeking to find a balance in their responses to the war that don’t offend users, partners and their own employees. As universities dealing with irate donors have found, that isn’t easy.
Social media giants are dealing with a debate over online expression. LinkedIn issued a warning to a pro-Israel website that accused thousands of people of publishing pro-terrorism content that was apparently scraped off the social network. Critics of the site said it featured people who didn’t explicitly support Hamas or who sought to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Meanwhile, Meta has struggled with applying its content policies fairly across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company has already apologized for a glitch that translated some language in user profiles from Arabic as “Palestinian terrorists.”
Employers are also facing pressure to take a stand. Corporate leaders have had to weigh how far to go in any statements they make, as they search for a balance between denouncing the Hamas attacks and antisemitism, and decrying Islamophobia and calling for a cease-fire.
Experts say companies often find themselves out of their depth in talking about the knotty topic and that sometimes there’s little benefit to rushing out a statement. Still, leaders of groups have been criticized for not commenting publicly, especially since organizations had spoken out on issues including abortion rights and Black Lives Matter.
Some companies, especially those without operations in the Middle East, have chosen not to speak. The C.O.O. of the software company Asana, for example, said it was guided by a major principle: “What problem are we trying to solve?”
High-ranking officials have already faced blowback. The C.E.O. of Web Summit, one of Europe’s biggest tech conferences, resigned this past weekend as major sponsors and speakers pulled out of the event following criticism of his public remarks on Israel.
And a top agent at Creative Artists Agency resigned her leadership roles at the firm after apologizing for content critical of Israel that she had posted on her Instagram account.
In related news: How diplomats from the U.S., Qatar and elsewhere helped free two Americans taken hostage by Hamas. These are the American weapons that Israel and Ukraine both want. And the comedian Dave Chappelle sparred with an audience member last week over pro-Palestinian comments he made onstage.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Chevron agrees to buy a rival driller, Hess, for $53 billion. The all-stock deal is the second takeover announced this month by an energy giant doubling down on its core business, despite concerns about climate change. Buying Hess will fortify Chevron’s holdings in oil-rich Guyana, just as Exxon Mobil’s $59.5 billion bid for Pioneer Natural Resources consolidates ownership of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico.
House Republicans plan a forum for speaker candidates. The event, scheduled for later ton Monday will give the nine lawmakers angling for the leadership position to state their case to colleagues ahead of a vote Tuesday on a new nominee. But the crowded field is likely to complicate that effort. The House remains unable to function without a presiding speaker.
Hollywood actors and studios will restart contract negotiations. The SAG-AFTRA union and the alliance representing media giants will meet on Tuesday, as figures on both sides press to restart American movie and television productions. The two were far apart earlier this month on issues including streaming payouts and the use of artificial intelligence.
A new report calls for a global minimum tax on billionaires. Researchers writing for the E.U. Tax Observatory found that a 2 percent levy on the world’s 2,756 wealthiest people could raise close to $250 billion a year for cash-strapped governments. It’s the latest demand for higher taxation of the wealthy amid criticism about their low overall tax bills, but given opposition among lawmakers, including in Congress, such a move is unlikely in the near term.

Big focus on Big Tech
Four of the world’s biggest publicly traded companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta — report earnings this week, with investors anxiously awaiting signs that Big Tech’s bet on artificial intelligence is beginning to pay off.
Microsoft and Google’s parent Alphabet will report on Tuesday. Meta is set to go on Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. Further out are Apple on Nov. 2 and Nvidia, the chip-maker, on Nov. 21.
Here’s what to watch: Consumer and business takeup of A.I. will be a big focus. Analysts will also be zeroing in on updates about the digital advertising and e-commerce markets, ahead of the crucial holiday sales period.

They will also want to know if the worst has passed after the tech giants laid off thousands of workers and slowed their corporate spending earlier this year amid an uncertain economic outlook.
A tech rally earlier this year has evaporated. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank to a near five-month low on Friday, as investors fretted about growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates. The Nasdaq has fallen roughly 3.3 percent since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, raising fears of a wider war in the region that could hurt an already fragile global economy.

Strong tech sector results in the first half of 2023 lifted the wider markets. Investors poured money into tech stocks as enthusiasm for companies at the forefront of A.I. soared on the buzz around Google’s Bard and ChatGPT, developed by the Microsoft-backed OpenAI.
That surge fueled Big Tech’s power in the markets. The five biggest tech firms account for roughly one-quarter of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and for an outsize share of its profit.
The bottom line: Investors hope that if strong results by the sector can ignite a new rally, it could lift the benchmark S&P 500 higher, too.
But Tesla may hold a warning. Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker is often lumped in with the giants of tech, and its stock is a constituent of the N.Y.S.E. FANG+ index. Tesla shares fell nearly 16 percent last week on disappointing earnings. That helped push the mega-cap index back into correction territory.
China fires a shot at Foxconn
Shares in Foxconn tumbled on Monday, after the Taiwanese manufacturer confirmed it was being investigated by the Chinese authorities. It’s the latest warning to foreign companies doing business in China, and came days after reports of a raid on the Shanghai offices of GroupM, a WPP-owned media agency, and the detention of one of its executives.
Apple shares are also down in premarket trading. Foxconn is the tech giant’s biggest manufacturing partner and has been a symbol of China’s industrial prowess. But Foxconn now faces a tax audit and officials are examining how it uses its land in the provinces of Hubei and Henan, home to the world’s biggest iPhone factory.
The Foxconn founder Terry Gou’s presidential bid may be one reason for the inquiry, analysts say. Gou stepped down from the board last month to run in Taiwanese elections in January. (He still holds a 12.5 percent stake in the company.) China has previously targeted Taiwanese companies at sensitive moments in relations between Beijing and Taipei.
Apple was already navigating an increasingly complicated relationship in China. Tim Cook, Apple’s C.E.O., met with senior officials in Beijing last week, his second visit to the country since pandemic restrictions were lifted last year. In recent months, the Chinese authorities have reportedly moved to bar some staff at government agencies and state-owned entities from using iPhones — a move that wiped billions off Apple’s stock market value — and sales of the new iPhone 15 have had a slow start there.
China is WPP’s fourth-biggest market. GroupM has forecast that China’s ad revenue will top $150.6 billion this year. But corruption is common in the industry, according to The Financial Times, which first reported the office raid. Clear Channel Outdoor agreed to a $26 million settlement with the S.E.C. last month after its Chinese unit was found to have bribed government officials in return for advertising contracts.
One bit of good trade news for China: Its relationship with Australia may be thawing. Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, said the two countries were a step closer to a deal to rescind Chinese tariffs on Australian wine. Beijing has imposed a range of restrictions on Australian goods in recent years following disputes over Huawei, the Chinese telecoms group, spying and the origins of Covid-19.
“Q-Day.”

The week ahead
Even aside from tech giants, it will be a busy week of earnings reports from automakers, Big Oil, defense contractors and others. That, and plenty of fresh economic data, are on the calendar this week.
Tuesday: Coca-Cola, General Motors, Halliburton and Puma will report quarterly earnings.
Wednesday: New home sales data will be a focus as housing prices surge. Boeing, Porsche and Hilton also report.
Thursday: It’s decision day for the European Central Bank, with economists forecasting that policymakers will leave the eurozone’s prime lending rate unchanged. In the U.S., the Commerce Department is set to release third-quarter G.D.P. data. Mastercard and Ford announce their results.
Friday: The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, on “core” personal consumption expenditures, is scheduled for release. The oil giants Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Eni also report.

2023-10-24,"Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, on Tuesday reported that its revenue rose 5 percent in the latest quarter after two straight quarters of declines, as the digital advertising market rebounded.
But Snap cautioned that the ad market remains unpredictable and that it has “observed pauses in spending from a large number of primarily brand-oriented advertising campaigns immediately following the onset of the war in the Middle East.”
Revenue for the third quarter was $1.19 billion, up from $1.13 billion a year ago and above Wall Street estimates of $1.11 billion. In the previous two quarters, Snap’s revenue had fallen between 4 percent and 7 percent.
The company remained unprofitable, recording a net loss of $368 million for the third quarter, which was wider than a loss of $360 million a year ago.

In a letter to investors, Evan Spiegel, Snap’s chief executive, said the company has “focused on improving our advertising platform” to generate higher returns for advertisers.
Many tech companies that rely on online advertising had seen sales slow last year amid rising inflation and economic uncertainty. The biggest companies, such as Google and Meta, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, began recovering earlier in the year. As a smaller social media company, Snap’s return to growth has been slower.
That led Snap to cut costs. The company recently closed down an augmented reality offering and announced 170 layoffs. Last year, it said it would cut 20 percent of its employees and discontinue at least six products.
Snap “is still a much smaller player than Meta and Google,” said Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. “Its ad platform is not quite as advanced and it is playing catch-up to some of its peers in terms of rebuilding that platform.”
Mr. Spiegel has pledged to change Snap’s trajectory. In a memo to employees last month, Mr. Spiegel said he wanted his company to reach the “stretch goal” of 20 percent advertising revenue growth in 2024. The memo was earlier reported by The Verge and confirmed by Snap.

Snap has nonetheless increased its number of users. Daily active users for the third quarter was 406 million, up 12 percent from a year ago. Last month, Snap said it had reached five million users for its paid subscription services, up from four million in June.
For the current quarter, the company projected that it would reach 410 million to 412 million daily active users and that it was internally forecasting revenue growth of 2 percent to 6 percent.
Snap has had a hard time making money from its users, since it is commonly used as a messaging platform and does not run ads in those chats, analysts said. The company now includes ads in features like Stories and Spotlight, scrollable feeds of photos and videos from creators. Last month, the company also said it had forged a partnership with Microsoft to include ads, which come in the form of sponsored links, in its A.I. chatbot, My AI.
Snap also said on Tuesday that Jerry Hunter, the chief operating officer, plans to retire next year. Mr. Hunter, who helped build engineering and the company’s business, will support Snap through July. No replacement was named."
2023-10-25,"Since Sept. 12., the Department of Justice and a group of state attorneys general have questioned more than 30 witnesses as they try to prove that Google broke antitrust laws, in a landmark monopoly trial that may affect the power of the technology industry.
The government is now wrapping up its side in the case — U.S. et al. v. Google — setting the stage for the internet giant to mount its defense starting this week.
Two prime threads have emerged from the government’s case: what it said Google did to illegally maintain its search and search ads monopolies and how those practices harmed consumers and advertisers. We lay out the main arguments.
How Google kept its online search dominance going
Google paid Apple billions of dollars to crush competition
On the first day of the trial, the Justice Department said Google had paid Apple and other tech platforms more than $10 billion a year to make itself the default search engine on the iPhone and other devices.
It was perhaps the most important piece of evidence to support the government’s central argument: that Google broke the law by using multibillion-dollar contracts to be the default search engine across the internet so it could maintain its monopoly. The eye-popping value of the deals had not been revealed before and helped the Justice Department set the tone for the trial.

The $10 billion figure has since loomed large. The Justice Department called several witnesses who said Google’s rich default deals made it impossible to compete. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, testified that he tried nearly every year to persuade Apple to switch its search default to Bing — and failed. DuckDuckGo said it was nearly impossible for consumers to discover its rival search engine because of Google’s default agreements.
The Justice Department also displayed internal documents from Google in which employees mused on the power of those defaults to keep rivals at bay. The company has countered that anyone can easily switch the defaults on Safari and other browsers.
Google’s scale makes it impossible for others to compete
The Justice Department has also circled around the idea that Google’s enormous scale distorts the competitive landscape, keeping even well-heeled rivals out of the search engine business — which only further empowers Google.
“This feedback loop, this wheel, has been turning for more than 12 years,” Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department’s lead courtroom lawyer, said in his opening statement. “And it always turns to Google’s advantage.”
Microsoft’s Mr. Nadella, who was one of the government’s star witnesses, called the internet the “Google web” and said even his big company had largely failed to make a dent in Google’s search dominance.
In one striking moment, Judge Amit P. Mehta, who is presiding over the case, asked Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google executive who later founded a competing search engine called Neeva, why Google made payments to Apple and others.
“The payments effectively make the ecosystem exceptionally resistant to change,” Mr. Ramaswamy replied.

How Google’s search dominance hurts people
Google blocks consumers from having access to choices
Government lawyers said Google’s dominance in search had led to a worse-quality product being delivered to consumers.
In one example, the government said that if Google had to compete more with other search engines, consumers might have access to services that were more respectful of their personal privacy. As it stands, Google monitors users to better target them with ads that fuel its bottom line, government lawyers said.
To underscore its point, the government called Gabriel Weinberg, the chief executive of DuckDuckGo, to the witness stand. DuckDuckGo says it collects less information from users than Google does.
Mr. Weinberg said his company struggled to put its search engine in front of users because of Google’s control over default search engines. DuckDuckGo had sought deals with companies like Apple and Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, to be the default search engine in the browsers’ private modes, he testified. But the companies had contracts with Google that were “the key thing preventing us from getting a deal done with them,” he said.
Google has countered that it is constantly improving its search engine, adding features to improve the experience for consumers.

Google uses its search dominance to wield power over online ads
Google’s power in search has allowed it to obtain influence over the market for ads that run alongside the links that appear in response to a user’s query, the government said.
Read the document
In this 2017 internal Google document, an executive compares the search ads business to that of selling cigarettes or drugs. The executive testified at the trial that he produced the document during a communications training where he was practicing how to use hyperbole to get someone’s attention.

Joshua Lowcock, who was an executive at an ad buying firm when he testified, said from the witness stand that his firm had, during one period several years ago, calculated Google’s share of search at over 88 percent and Bing’s at just over 6 percent. That dominance made Google’s search ads attractive to the firm’s clients and limited the usefulness of Bing’s ads, he said.
The government also called employees of major advertisers like Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase to attest to the importance of Google’s search advertising services.
Arjan Dijk, a onetime Google executive who now runs marketing for the travel site Booking.com, said Google’s search ads gave it access to an “exclusive, dominant” pool of potential customers.
That allows Google to raise ad prices
During testimony, the Justice Department hammered Google employees over whether they can inflate the prices for search ads because marketers have limited options if they want to spend their money elsewhere.
In one 2019 email shown in court, Jerry Dischler, a Google executive, wrote to a colleague that the company was at risk of missing its revenue targets. If it wanted to avoid spooking Wall Street, he wrote, the company should consider tweaking aspects of its products to drive more search queries and increase ad revenue.
Jeff Hurst, the former chief operating officer of Expedia, pointed to the experience of Vrbo, its vacation rental site, as evidence of Google’s power to raise prices without delivering more value for advertisers.

In 2015, Vrbo spent $21 million on Google search ads, generating about 500 million online visits to Vrbo, Mr. Hurst testified. By 2019, Vrbo was paying Google roughly $290 million for search advertising for about the same volume of traffic as four years earlier.
“We spent a heck of a lot more with Google for no incremental benefit,” Mr. Hurst said.
In the cross-examination of Mr. Hurst, a Google lawyer noted that both Expedia and Vrbo had grown and prospered since 2015, and Expedia had shifted its strategy to focus more on generating traffic directly from the mobile apps for its main businesses, Expedia, Vrbo and Hotels.com."
2023-10-26,"Amazon reported solid quarterly sales on Thursday, showing that corporations and consumers are spending as inflation has eased.
The company posted $143.1 billion in revenue for the third quarter, up 13 percent from a year earlier. It had $9.9 billion in profits. The results beat analysts’ expectations and surpassed Amazon’s own forecast.
But Amazon also projected a cautious forecast for the holiday quarter, saying sales growth may moderate somewhat in the last three months of the year. The fourth quarter is typically Amazon’s biggest, a period that includes Christmas shopping and an October deals event.
Investors have been keenly focused on the performance of Amazon’s cloud computing business, which is critical to Amazon because it produces a majority of the company’s profits.

For almost a year, the growth of the cloud computing business rapidly decelerated, as enterprise customers cautiously watched their budgets in the uncertain economy. But Thursday’s results showed signs it was stabilizing. Sales in the cloud computing division were up 12 percent, to $23 billion. It had $7 billion in operating profit.
It’s a “delicate” moment, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s finance chief, said on a call with reporters and investors. He said the work business customers have done to reduce their cloud computing costs has slowed some — but not entirely. At the same time, some of them are adding new cloud projects.
Though Amazon is the top provider of cloud computing, it is working to shake off the perception that it is lagging behind rivals, most notably Microsoft and Google, in the wave of generative artificial intelligence sweeping the industry. It has introduced new A.I. products for enterprise customers, and last month it announced plans to invest up to $4 billion in the A.I. start-up Anthropic, which competes with OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed start-up that created the popular chatbot ChatGPT.
A year ago, investors fretted about the state of Amazon’s retail business, whose profits tanked after overexpanding during the pandemic. Andy Jassy, the company’s chief executive, has focused on driving profits by cutting costs and has overseen layoffs, and a drastic pullback in hiring. The company employed 1.5 million people in the most recent quarter, down 3 percent from a year earlier, though still twice as many as before the pandemic.
Consumers are still spending, though are “deal driven” and focusing on lower cost items, Mr. Olsavsky said.

This year, Amazon also rolled out changes to how it fulfilled customer orders, placing more inventory closer to customers in a move that improved delivery speeds and brought down costs.
“The benefits of moving from a single national fulfillment network in the U.S. to eight distinct regions are exceeding our optimistic expectations,” Mr. Jassy said in a statement.
Faster speeds have “increased purchase frequency,” Mr. Olsavsky said, and the lower costs have improved profit margins. Sales for the consumer and retail offerings in North America, its most mature market, increased 11 percent to $87.9 billion, producing $4.3 billion in operating profit.
Several of the most profitable parts of its e-commerce business — notably its advertising offerings — performed well. Growth of Amazon’s advertising revenue accelerated to 26 percent, reaching $12 billion in the quarter.
Sales of services Amazon provides to third-party sellers on its marketplace grew 20 percent, to $34 billion. The costs for sellers to do business on Amazon is a key issue in the long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission last month."

Higher labor costs could affect the economics of electric vehicles at Ford and elsewhere.

Chase Castor for The New York Times
What next for car manufacturers?
In reaching a tentative contract with the U.A.W., Ford has moved to make peace with restive employees, one of the most costly problems it has faced in recent years.
With that in mind, investors are weighing how much this week’s preliminary deal might weigh on the automaker as it deals with a different major issue: slower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles. The stakes are high, as the U.A.W. pushes for similar concessions from Ford’s rivals as they confront the same challenges.
The new contract could cost Ford up to $2 billion annually over four years, according to Barclays analysts, or about 1 percent of sales. The company said it would look to offset those costs elsewhere.
Employees were jubilant about the preliminary deal, which includes a 25 percent pay increase over the life of the contract and improvements on job security, pensions and more. “This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford,” one worker, Robert Carter, told The Times.
The higher expenses come as Ford grapples with other issues. Among them are costs associated with electric vehicles — the company’s E.V. division lost $1.3 billion in the third quarter because of investments in new technology and greater competition — and cooling demand for such vehicles.
Experts appear split on the contract’s effect:
Some analysts said the higher labor costs will hurt Ford as it deals with price cuts on cars by rivals like Tesla. “It adds a constraint in a very competitive market,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, who suggested that Ford may move more production to, say, Mexico to reduce labor costs.
Others were more sanguine, arguing that other carmakers will need to raise wages to keep up. Regarding Ford, “They haven’t agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness,” said Joshua Murray, a professor at Vanderbilt University who has chronicled the auto giants’ recent troubles.
What to watch: whether the Ford deal helps the U.A.W. reach agreements with General Motors and Stellantis. The union met with both carmakers on Thursday, according to Bloomberg, though it’s unclear whether those companies are willing to offer the same terms as Ford.

2023-10-29,"A peaceful end to the war in Ukraine. That was the wish behind a post that Simge Krüger made on LinkedIn in March.
In response, people began posting their wishes that her husband, father and brother be killed in combat. Seeing that she lived in Germany, they called her a Nazi.
“I was just talking about peace and I’m suddenly a Nazi,” Ms. Krüger, a Turkish citizen who lives in Hamburg, said in an interview.
Weeks later, sitting in a workshop led by a pro-democracy organization, she came to understand what happened in that dizzying moment. The insults had nothing to do with her ethnic background or political leanings. The people targeting her comment were trying to whip up emotion and further polarize a world torn over issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine, gender identity and climate change.
The best way to resist, she was taught in the class, was not by trying to explain her position or defend herself, but by asking probing questions.

“People who believe conspiracy theories usually just have one line of argumentation, but there’s nothing behind it,” she said. “When you start carving into their iceberg, you quickly realize that it has no depth.”
These lessons came from an eight-week program offered by her employer, Hays, a multinational recruitment firm with 3,500 employees in Germany. The company said the project dovetailed its own aim of strengthening democratic values and making their employees more resilient.
Across Germany, several hundred companies have taken part in such workshops, and similar classes are being held in other Western countries, including the United States. Businesses are finding they need to bolster their employees in the face of increasingly vitriolic political debate. Seminars on civics and democratic principles — such as the importance of voting or recognizing the dangers of disinformation, conspiracy theories and hate speech — have become a way to ensure healthier relationships at the workplace, and in society at large. In addition, reports show that economic growth is higher in stable democracies, and liberal border policies allow companies to attract skilled immigrants.
Since the initial offering that Ms. Krüger took part in, Hays has trained more individual employees and incorporated elements of the workshops into its companywide mandatory training, said Mimoza Murseli, a project coordinator for diversity and inclusion at Hays.

“We gained confidence in standing our ground.”
Groups like the Business Council for Democracy and Weltoffenes Sachsen in Germany and Civic Alliance or the Leadership Now Project in the United States organize workshops like the one Ms. Krüger took part in, provide research and webinars, and support civic education and get-out-the-vote efforts — all of it nonpartisan. Most are nonprofit organizations, backed by independent foundations or a group of businesses that rely on their political independence as a selling point.
In Germany, the Network for Democracy and Courage has offered various workshops on civics and democracy to schools and young people for over two decades. But five years ago, it was approached by a group of businesses in the eastern state of Saxony, where far-right politicians have been attracting more followers.
A key principle of the workshops was that they be voluntary for employees, said Nina Gbur, the organization’s project manager. They also have to be ideologically neutral, and not target any group or members of a given political party.

“It’s not like companies come to us and say, ‘We have a section where three racists are sitting,’” Ms. Gbur said. “That would be completely unrealistic.”
When harsh language is ‘just not acceptable.’
Germany is far from reaching the levels of political polarization that have wracked the United States. But the arrival of more than 1 million immigrants in 2015 and 2016 has inflamed debate.
Over this time, a far-right party, the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has disrupted the country’s political landscape with its embrace of nationalist, anti-immigration policies. Known for pushing boundaries and a more confrontational, aggressive style of politics, the AfD is gaining support; a recent poll showed more than one in five Germans supporting the party, up from 10 percent in the 2021 election.
Reflecting this shift, the tone in public discourse has become more raw. Kerstin Schultheiss, a managing director at the Leipziger Gruppe, noticed it in her company, which employs 5,000 people who provide public services in the city of Leipzig.

Several managers told her of increased tensions among employees as well as in their dealings with the public. Common flash points were the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, government mandates to  conserve energy or Russia’s war in Ukraine. Employees were subject to harsh comments that went beyond a typical disagreement or a complaint, she said, especially those who deal with the public, like tram drivers.
“There are simply people who think differently and express this difference in a way that is just not acceptable,” Ms. Schultheiss said.
When she heard about the civics training offered by the Business Council for Democracy,  she applied to participate.
“We have to create a space where all employees feel comfortable and create a working environment in which they can function and work well, and in which they are not harassed by anyone because of their political views,” Ms. Schultheiss said.
The training offerings vary. In Germany, media literacy has been a critical issue, while programs in the United States are frequently focused on teaching employees about how the government works and voting rights. But their basic premise is to empower employees to understand how their actions, both in and out of the workplace, affect the political climate and, ultimately, their own jobs.

At Nomos Glashütte, a maker of luxury watches based in Saxony, company leaders worry that if the AfD were to come to power, customers and potential employees could be repelled, threatening their business.
“Democracy is the basis of our entrepreneurial activity,” said Judith Borowski, managing director of Nomos, which offers its employees civics workshops. “And if we no longer have democracy, then the basis for our entrepreneurial activities will also be very curtailed.”
How the ‘ah-ha’ effect can change discourse.
The idea behind the Business Council for Democracy workshops is to fill gaps in workers’ knowledge of the basic underpinnings of the democratic system, especially in a digital civic culture. The programs teach how to recognize and question conspiracy theories and disinformation, aiming to reinforce personal responsibility and resilience against polarizing content.
Debate is an essential part of the program and all workshops remain strictly confidential. What is said in the room, stays in the room, to foster a space where people can be open and vulnerable. Some are held in-person but most are online, which is easier for people who work shifts.
Sessions are run once a week for eight weeks, during working hours. A trained mediator brings up a topic to discuss. In the case of recognizing disinformation, the mediator might show examples of comments or images that have circulated on social media.
For example, during the pandemic in 2020, when government lockdowns prevented Germans from socializing and holiday festivities were canceled, a photograph started making the rounds showing several prominent politicians standing shoulder to shoulder, smiling and sharing mugs of hot mulled wine, with commentary expressing the idea that those making the rules were allowed to break them, while others were not.

After discussing the image, participants were shown how to check when it was taken. In the case of the merrymaking politicians, it turned out to be from 2019, the year before the pandemic.
“For the training, we use very concrete examples to make it really clear what is happening, how they are being used,” said Susann Planert, a personnel policy specialist at Leipziger who is trained to lead the workshops.
Another example she likes to use is taking an image of an article from one of the country’s major news outlets and running it through a digital tool that lets a user alter the wording in the headline. A screenshot of the new version with an altered outrageous or inflammatory headline can then quickly be posted on social media.

“Such a technical gimmick can have a huge impact,” she said. “Every time I do this in a training session, it has an ‘ah-ha’ effect because it makes obvious how easy it is to manipulate information.”
Making an investment in future security.
The lack of civics understanding among employees has come to the attention of businesses in both Germany and the United States in recent years.
In Germany, the focus is particularly acute in the former East German regions, where democracy has only been around since Germany reunified in 1990. In the United States, surveys point to declining civics understanding among adults.Both situations translate to weaker social discourse and faith in public institutions.

Employers are realizing they are in a unique position to fill information gaps. According to the Pew Research Center, only 17 percent of Americans trust officials in power in Washington to do the right thing. But business is viewed as the one institution that is both ethical and competent, according the Edelman Trust Barometer.

Many younger people now expect  their employers to champion civic causes, said Steven Levine, director of the Civic Alliance, a nonpartisan coalition in the United States of over 1,300 businesses including Microsoft, McDonald’s, Target and Ecolab.
“Companies have seen themselves in recent years as an important collective stabilizing force in helping ensure that the norms of democracy are upheld,” Mr. Levine said.
Misinformation can rattle markets. In May, an image generated by artificial intelligence showing black smoke billowing  near the Pentagon briefly sent stocks tumbling. But a big focus of employers in the United States has been turning out the vote. Mr. Levine cited companies like Patagonia that close stores and offices on Election Day to allow employees to vote and volunteer at polls, and the National Basketball Association’s decision to have all 30 teams play the day before Election Day 2022, using the opportunity to encourage fans to vote, and not scheduling any games on the next day.
As next year’s presidential election approaches, companies are concerned about the potential for instability, said Daniella Ballou-Aares, chief executive of the Leadership Now Project, an organization of U.S. business leaders dedicated to promoting and protecting democracy.
She cited the legal battle between Disney and Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, and the blowback Delta Air Lines faced from  from customers over its response to legislation restricting voting in Georgia.

Something similar happened to Nomos, the German watch maker. In 2018, an angry mob led by far-right politicians held a protest in a city not far the company’s headquarters, chanting slogans against immigrants and chasing dark-skinned bystanders. News footage of the disturbance was seen by customers as far away as New York, who called the company to express alarm.
“We had a feeling that politics like this could become a stark location disadvantage,” said Ms. Borowski, the managing director. Fearing corrosive ideas could spread among its employees, the company began offering civics workshops.
As markets and policymakers struggle with wars in Europe and the Middle East, instability in one leading country is bound to reverberate across others, Ms. Ballou-Aares said.
“If you see a disruption in democracy in a major economy,”  she said, “it’s going to be a big deal.”"
2023-10-30,"President Biden will issue an executive order on Monday outlining the federal government’s first regulations on artificial intelligence systems. They include requirements that the most advanced A.I. products be tested to assure that they cannot be used to produce biological or nuclear weapons, with the findings from those tests reported to the federal government.
The testing requirements are a small but central part of what Mr. Biden, in a speech scheduled for Monday afternoon, is expected to describe as the most sweeping government action to protect Americans from the potential risks brought by the huge leaps in A.I. over the past several years.
The regulations will include recommendations, but not requirements, that photos, videos and audio developed by such systems be watermarked to make clear that they were created by A.I. That reflects a rising fear that A.I. will make it far easier to create “deep fakes” and convincing disinformation, especially as the 2024 presidential campaign accelerates.
The United States recently restricted the export of high-performing chips to China to slow its ability to produce so-called large language models, the massing of data that has made programs like ChatGPT so effective at answering questions and speeding tasks. Similarly, the new regulations will require companies that run cloud services to tell the government about their foreign customers.

Mr. Biden’s order will be issued days before a gathering of world leaders on A.I. safety organized by Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak. On the issue of A.I. regulation, the United States has trailed the European Union, which has been drafting new laws, and other nations, like China and Israel, that have issued proposals for regulations. Ever since ChatGPT, the A.I.-powered chatbot, exploded in popularity last year, lawmakers and global regulators have grappled with how artificial intelligence might alter jobs, spread disinformation and potentially develop its own kind of intelligence.
“President Biden is rolling out the strongest set of actions any government in the world has ever taken on A.I. safety, security and trust,” said Bruce Reed, a White House deputy chief of staff. “It’s the next step in an aggressive strategy to do everything on all fronts to harness the benefits of A.I. and mitigate the risks.”
The new U.S. rules, some of which are set to go into effect in the next 90 days, are likely to face many challenges, some legal and some political. But the order is aimed at the most advanced future systems, and it largely does not address the immediate threats of existing chatbots that could be used to spread disinformation related to Ukraine, Gaza or the presidential campaign.
The administration did not release the language of the executive order on Sunday, but officials said that some of the steps in the order would require approval by independent agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission.
The order affects only American companies, but because software development happens around the world, the United States will face diplomatic challenges enforcing the regulations, which is why the administration is attempting to encourage allies and adversaries alike to develop similar rules. Vice President Kamala Harris is representing the United States at the conference in London on the topic this week.

The regulations are also intended to influence the technology sector by setting first-time standards for safety, security and consumer protections. By using the power of its purse strings, the White House’s directives to federal agencies aim to force companies to comply with standards set by their government customers.

“This is an important first step and, importantly, executive orders set norms,” said Lauren Kahn, a senior research analyst at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University.
The order instructs the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies to create clear safety standards for the use of A.I. and to streamline systems to make it easier to purchase A.I. tools. It orders the Department of Labor and the National Economic Council to study A.I.’s effect on the labor market and to come up with potential regulations. And it calls for agencies to provide clear guidance to landlords, government contractors and federal benefits programs to prevent discrimination from algorithms used in A.I. tools.

But the White House is limited in its authority, and some of the directives are not enforceable. For instance, the order calls for agencies to strengthen internal guidelines to protect personal consumer data, but the White House also acknowledged the need for privacy legislation to fully ensure data protection.

To encourage innovation and bolster competition, the White House will request that the F.T.C. step up its role as the watchdog on consumer protection and antitrust violations. But the White House does not have authority to direct the F.T.C., an independent agency, to create regulations.
Lina Khan, the chair of the trade commission, has already signaled her intent to act more aggressively as an A.I. watchdog. In July, the commission opened an investigation into OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, over possible consumer privacy violations and accusations of spreading false information about individuals.
“Although these tools are novel, they are not exempt from existing rules, and the F.T.C. will vigorously enforce the laws we are charged with administering, even in this new market,” Ms. Khan wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times in May.
The tech industry has said it supports regulations, though the companies disagree on the level of government oversight. Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Meta are among 15 companies that have agreed to voluntary safety and security commitments, including having third parties stress-test their systems for vulnerabilities.
Mr. Biden has called for regulations that support the opportunities of A.I. to help in medical and climate research, while also creating guardrails to protect against abuses. He has stressed the need to balance regulations with support for U.S. companies in a global race for A.I. leadership. And toward that end, the order directs agencies to streamline the visa process for highly skilled immigrants and nonimmigrants with expertise in A.I. to study and work in the United States.

The central regulations to protect national security will be outlined in a separate document, called the National Security Memorandum, to be produced by next summer. Some of those regulations will be public, but many are expected to remain classified — particularly those concerning steps to prevent foreign nations, or nonstate actors, from exploiting A.I. systems.
A senior Energy Department official said last week that the National Nuclear Security Administration had already begun exploring how these systems could speed nuclear proliferation, by solving complex issues in building a nuclear weapon. And many officials have focused on how these systems could enable a terror group to assemble what is needed to produce biological weapons.
Still, lawmakers and White House officials have cautioned against moving too quickly to write laws for A.I. technologies that are swiftly changing. The E.U. did not consider large language models in its first legislative drafts.
“If you move too quickly in this, you may screw it up,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said last week."
2023-10-31,"Iranian hackers are waging a sophisticated espionage campaign targeting the country’s rivals across the Middle East and attacking key defense and intelligence agencies, according to a leading Israeli-American cybersecurity company, a sign of how Iran’s quickly improving cyberattacks have become a new, important prong in a shadow war.
Over the past year, the hackers struck at countries including Israel, Saudi Arabia and Jordan in a monthslong campaign linked to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, according to a new report by the company, Check Point.
The Iranian hackers appeared to gain access to emails from an array of targets, including government staff members, militaries, telecommunications companies and financial organizations, the report said.
The malware used to infiltrate the computers also appeared to map out the networks the hackers had broken into, providing Iran with a blueprint of foreign cyberinfrastructure that could prove helpful for planning and executing future attacks.

“The primary purpose of this operation is espionage,” security experts at Check Point wrote in the report, adding that the approach was “notably more sophisticated compared to previous activities” that Check Point had linked to Iran.
Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not respond to an inquiry on Monday about the hack. But Iran’s minister of defense, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, said last week in a speech to his country’s defense officials that given the current complex security situation in the Middle East, Iran had to redefine its national defenses beyond its geographic borders.
He said that meant utilizing new warfare strategies to defend Iran, including the use of space, cyberspace and other ways. “Our enemies know that if they make one mistake, the Islamic Republic of Iran will respond with force,” General Ashtiani said, according to Iranian media.

Although the report did not specify what, if any, data Iran had taken, Check Point said the hacking campaign successfully broke into computers associated with the Saudi Arabian ministry of defense, and agencies, banks and telecom firms in several other Middle Eastern countries including Jordan, Kuwait and Oman. The report also did not specify which Israeli systems had been hacked.
A senior Israeli official dealing with cyber issues has confirmed that in recent months an attack by a group known as LionTail has been underway against local and national government agencies and various institutions in Israel. The official said that the attacks are identified and handled by Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, and the Israeli National Cyber Directorate.

Another official said that LionTail is one of 15 groups affiliated, directly or as a proxy, with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence.
The second Israeli official added that in recent months there have been attempts by Iranian cybergroups or those that belong to Hamas or Hezbollah to hack cameras in Israel, including private cameras near the border with Lebanon, and that the National Cyber Directorate issued an urgent warning to the public with instructions on how to better secure the cameras.
The Saudi government’s Center for International Communication, which handles media inquiries, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Jordan’s information minister did not immediately respond to a similar request.
The cyberattacks mark a new phase in a digital conflict between Iran and its rivals. The widespread and surprisingly sophisticated hacks, according to Check Point, underscored how Iran has found ways to punch back in an arena where it had been outmuscled.

Thousands of tons of aid are stranded because distributing them is too dangerous, relief groups say.
“This is the most sophisticated and stealthy Iranian cyberattack we’ve seen,” said Sergey Shykevich, who oversees threat intelligence at Check Point and led the research for the report. “There’s a clear common denominator between the victims we’ve spotted across the Middle East: whether they’re from the government, financial or NGO sectors — they’re all a top intelligence priority for the Iranian government.”

The campaign follows a series of other Iranian cyberattacks over the past two years, experts said, including one aimed at critical U.S. infrastructure and another that sought to impersonate a nuclear expert at an American research institute.
Researchers at Microsoft said earlier this year that Iran was running more sophisticated operations that sought to undermine warming ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia and foment unrest in Bahrain. The most recent attack may be Iran’s most successful yet, as it helped the country to gain potentially critical intelligence, and knowledge that could help with future cyberstrikes, according to the Check Point report.
“The attackers were able to exfiltrate big amounts of data unnoticed for a long period of time, from days to months, potentially achieving significant and sensitive data which could be of service to them for various purposes,” Mr. Shykevich said.
“Some of the information Iran gained from previous cyberattacks in the past was used by them long after the attack took place,” he added. “This can indicate that this specific campaign, with its width and sophistication, may be of use for Iran for years to come.”
The quiet but sustained campaign amounts to a sort of Iranian counteroffensive in a digital shadow war that has been running for well over a decade against countries like Israel, and one in which Tehran has been at a disadvantage. It underscores Iran’s fast improving capabilities and determination to break into the networks of regional rivals at a moment when tensions in the Middle East have erupted into war.

For years, Israel and Iran have engaged in a covert war, by land, sea, air and computer, but the targets have usually been military- or government-related. Two years ago the cyberwar widened to target civilians on a large scale. Suddenly, millions of ordinary people in Iran and Israel found themselves caught in the crossfire of a cyberwar between their countries.

Iran has accused Israel of a hack that took down a portion of the country’s gas stations in 2021, leaving motorists without fuel. In Israel, hundreds of thousands of people panicked when they learned that their private details were stolen from an L.G.B.T.Q. dating site and were uploaded on social media, one of a series of attacks by cybergroups associated with Iran.
The latest cyberattacks stand out, according to Check Point, for the way Iranians redesigned malware they had once used to openly pilfer data into a less detectable means of accumulating huge amounts of secret government data, not unlike a wiretap.
The code had striking similarities to a program used to attack the Albanian government last year, Check Point said. That hack, in which a large amount of sensitive police data was taken and posted online, led Albania to break off diplomatic relations with Iran, which officially denied it was responsible.

The malware exploits a known vulnerability in outdated versions of Microsoft Windows servers. After infecting a vulnerable computer, the program burrows deep into the network, in some cases for months, quietly gathering and transmitting data back to Iran. Check Point observed that the attackers were able to customize the malware for each network, revealing the growing scale of Iran’s cybercapabilities.

Initially, as the world learned about the powers of hacking, Iran was perhaps the best known victim of the real-world impact of digital weapons. In 2010, centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility were hijacked by a cyberweapon built and used by the United States and Israel. Over the course of a year, the cyberweapon, called Stuxnet, was used to manipulate Iranian nuclear equipment, and later, to destroy part of the facilities.
At the time, experts in the United States said Iran's hacking capabilities were clumsy and elementary. But Stuxnet “was a big wake-up call,” said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of counter adversary operations at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. “What we saw after Stuxnet, was that Iran threat actors started professionalizing.”
Mr. Meyers also noted an uptick in regional cyberactivity after the Iran nuclear deal went into effect in late 2015. “Iranian threat actors stopped targeting the West” and focused their energy on regional targets, he said.

In recent years cybersecurity groups have warned of Iran’s fast evolving capabilities as it has narrowed the gap with other United States rivals, like Russia and China. In particular, officials have said that a new burst of cyberattacks began in 2018, after President Donald J. Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.
By 2019, Iran had assailed more than a half-dozen United States government agencies with hacks that exploited underlying weaknesses in the internet’s backbone and were more difficult to detect.

2023-11-01,"In 1950, Alan Turing, the gifted British mathematician and code-breaker, published an academic paper. His aim, he wrote, was to consider the question, “Can machines think?”
The answer runs to almost 12,000 words. But it ends succinctly: “We can only see a short distance ahead,” Mr. Turing wrote, “but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.”
More than seven decades on, that sentiment sums up the mood of many policymakers, researchers and tech leaders attending Britain’s A.I. Safety Summit on Wednesday, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hopes will position the country as a leader in the global race to harness and regulate artificial intelligence.
On Wednesday morning, his government released a document called the Bletchley Declaration, signed by representatives from the 28 countries attending the event, including the U.S. and China, which warned of the dangers posed by the most advanced “frontier” A.I. systems.

“There is potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional, stemming from the most significant capabilities of these A.I. models,” the declaration said.
“Many risks arising from A.I. are inherently international in nature, and so are best addressed through international cooperation. We resolve to work together in an inclusive manner to ensure human-centric, trustworthy and responsible A.I.”
The document fell short, however, of setting specific policy goals. A second meeting is scheduled to be held in six months in South Korea and a third in France in a year.
Governments have scrambled to address the risks posed by the fast-evolving technology since last year’s release of ChatGPT, a humanlike chatbot that demonstrated how the latest models are advancing in powerful and unpredictable ways.
Future generations of A.I. systems could accelerate the diagnosis of disease, help combat climate change and streamline manufacturing processes, but also present significant dangers in terms of job losses, disinformation and national security. A British government report last week warned that advanced A.I. systems “may help bad actors perform cyberattacks, run disinformation campaigns and design biological or chemical weapons.”

The two-day summit in Britain is at Bletchley Park, a countryside estate 50 miles north of London, where Mr. Turing helped crack the Enigma code used by the Nazis during World War II. Considered one of the birthplaces of modern computing, the location is a conscious nod to the prime minister’s hopes that Britain could be at the center of another world-leading initiative.
Bletchley is “evocative in that it captures a very defining moment in time, where great leadership was required from government but also a moment when computing was front and center,” said Ian Hogarth, a tech entrepreneur and investor who was appointed by Mr. Sunak to lead the government’s task force on A.I. risk, and who helped organize the summit. “We need to come together and agree on a wise way forward.”
With Elon Musk and other tech executives in the audience, King Charles III delivered a video address in the opening session, recorded at Buckingham Palace before he departed for a state visit to Kenya this week. “We are witnessing one of the greatest technological leaps in the history of human endeavor,” he said. “There is a clear imperative to ensure that this rapidly evolving technology remains safe and secure.”

Vice President Kamala Harris, and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, were taking part in meetings on behalf of the United States.
Wu Zhaohui, China’s vice minister of science and technology, told attendees that Beijing was willing to “enhance dialogue and communication” with other countries about A.I. safety. China is developing its own initiative for A.I. governance, he said, adding that the technology is “uncertain, unexplainable and lacks transparency.”
In a speech on Friday, Mr. Sunak addressed criticism he had received from China hawks over the attendance of a delegation from Beijing. “Yes — we’ve invited China,” he said. “I know there are some who will say they should have been excluded. But there can be no serious strategy for A.I. without at least trying to engage all of the world’s leading A.I. powers.”

With development of leading A.I. systems concentrated in the United States and a small number of other countries, some attendees said regulations must account for the technology’s impact globally. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a minister of technology representing India, said policies must be set by a “coalition of nations rather than just one country to two countries.”

“By allowing innovation to get ahead of regulation, we open ourselves to the toxicity and misinformation and weaponization that we see on the internet today, represented by social media,” he said.
Executives from leading technology and A.I. companies, including Anthropic, Google DeepMind, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI and Tencent, were attending the conference. Also sending representatives were a number of civil society groups, among them Britain’s Ada Lovelace Institute and the Algorithmic Justice League, a nonprofit in Massachusetts.
In a surprise move, Mr. Sunak announced on Monday that he would take part in a live interview with Mr. Musk on his social media platform X after the summit ends on Thursday.
Some analysts argue that the conference will be heavier on symbolism than substance, with a number of key political leaders absent, including President Biden, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany.
And many governments are moving forward with their own laws and regulations. Mr. Biden announced an executive order this week requiring A.I. companies to assess national security risks before releasing their technology to the public. The European Union’s A.I. Act, which could be finalized within weeks, represents a far-reaching attempt to protect citizens from harm. China is also cracking down on how A.I. is used, including censoring chatbots.

Britain, home to many universities where artificial intelligence research is being conducted, has taken a more hands-off approach. The government believes that existing laws and regulations are sufficient for now, while announcing a new A.I. Safety Institute that will evaluate and test new models.
Mr. Hogarth, whose team has negotiated early access to the models of several large A.I. companies to research their safety, said he believed that Britain could play an important role in figuring out how governments could “capture the benefits of these technologies as well as putting guardrails around them.”
In his speech last week, Mr. Sunak affirmed that Britain’s approach to the potential risks of the technology is “not to rush to regulate.”
“How can we write laws that make sense for something we don’t yet fully understand?” he said."
2023-11-02,"At a time when the tech industry’s biggest companies are rebounding from a post-pandemic dip, Apple is suffering through its most prolonged sales slump in more than a decade.
On Thursday, the world’s most valuable tech company said that sales fell 1 percent, to $89.5 billion, from last year for the three months that ended in September, bringing an end to a fiscal year in which it posted sales declines every quarter. The company reported that profits rose 11 percent, to $22.96 billion.
Apple’s most important business, the iPhone, rallied last month behind the release of four new devices, which boosted sales 3 percent, to $43.81 billion, from last year. And the company’s sales for software and services, such as Apple Music and cloud storage, jumped 16 percent, to $22.31 billion.
But sales sank for most of the company’s other businesses, including the Mac, iPad, and the Apple Watch and AirPods. Total product sales dropped by 5 percent, to $67.18 billion.

The results exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for $89.34 billion in sales and $21.77 billion in profit. The company said that it expected sales to be similar in the current quarter to the same period a year ago, disappointing Wall Street, which had projected that sales would increase from a year ago.
Apple’s shares have declined 11 percent from their peak this summer and were down more than 3 percent in after-hour trading on Thursday.
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, faces a bevy of challenges in the year ahead. After a surge in demand for new 5G iPhones, wireless carriers are reporting a slowdown in the number of people buying new smartphones in the United States, Apple’s largest market, according to Arete Research, an investment research firm.
The company said that supply constraints for the iPhone 15 in September blunted sales during the month, but that supplies were improving and would be able to fulfill demand in the current quarter.
In China, Apple is confronting renewed competition in the luxury smartphone business from Huawei. The Chinese smartphone maker had been hampered in recent years by U.S. restrictions on its access to 5G technology and Android software, but in August it revealed a jade-green smartphone, Mate 60 Pro, that has the same capabilities as many iPhones. Its release was followed by the Chinese government directing employees of some government agencies to stop using iPhones for work.

Sales of Apple’s new flagship iPhones declined 4.5 percent during the final weeks of September from last year, according to Counterpoint Research, which analyzes the smartphone market. The dip was an outgrowth of the broader downturn in consumer spending in China, the firm said.
Last month, China expanded its challenge to Apple’s business by launching a regulatory review of the company’s biggest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn of Taiwan. The manufacturer is facing a tax audit and being investigated over its compliance with land use regulations. The scrutiny comes as Terry Gou, Foxconn’s founder, runs for Taiwan’s presidency in a campaign that could boost the ruling party, which opposes closer ties with Beijing.
Mr. Cook traveled to China last month in an unannounced visit that included stops at an Apple store, a visit to the factory of Luxshare Precision, a Chinese iPhone manufacturer, and a meeting with Wang Wentao, the country’s commerce minister.
“I could not be more excited about the interactions I had with customers and employees,” Mr. Cook said during a call with analysts on Thursday. He said that the company’s business in China remained strong, adding that the iPhone business set a record in mainland China during the three months that ended in September.
The broader tech industry has been lifted by enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence. Last month, Microsoft reported that investments in A.I. were beginning to help sales of its cloud-computing business. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which has invested heavily in A.I., disappointed investors, who had hoped for a greater lift to sales. Amazon and Meta Platforms, Facebook’s parent company, also emphasized their investments in that area.

But Apple, which is known for its secrecy, has been quiet about its plans for generative A.I. On Thursday, Mr. Cook said that the company was investing in generative A.I. but was unlikely to provide details until it had a product to bring to market. “We’re going to do it responsibly, and you’re going to see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart,” Mr. Cook said.
As it looks ahead to next year, much of the company’s focus will shift to the release of its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. The $3,500 device, the Vision Pro, has the potential to provide a new revenue stream at a time when sales of its other products have slowed. Analysts project Apple will sell fewer than half a million units.
The company also is focused on reviving sales of its iPads and Macs. On Monday, Apple revealed new MacBook Pros and iMacs with speedier processors and encouraged customers with older Macs to upgrade. Sales of Macs declined 27 percent, to $29.36 billion, over the past fiscal year."

2023-11-05,"For two months, Google has squared off against the Justice Department in court in Washington over claims that the company is abusing its dominant position in online search and advertising to crush rivals, a high-stakes antitrust case that could reshape the world’s most popular search engine. Now, it’s facing another legal challenge closer to home.
On Monday, Epic Games, the company behind the hit game Fortnite, will appear in federal court in San Francisco to kick off a monthlong trial in its own antitrust lawsuit against Google. Epic is expected to argue that Google is violating both state and federal antitrust laws — as well as its founding principle, “Don’t be evil” — by wielding monopolistic power over app developers on its Google Play Store on Android mobile phones.
“Google has relegated its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize,” Epic wrote in its complaint, which was first filed in 2020. The video game developer had tried to bypass the Play Store’s fees by letting Fortnite players pay Epic directly for in-app items, prompting Google to bar the game from the store.
If Epic wins, Google could be forced to alter its restrictive Play Store rules, allowing other companies to offer competing app stores and making it easier for developers to avoid the cut it collects from in-app purchases. Google generally takes a 15 percent fee for customer payments for app subscriptions and 30 percent for purchases made within apps that are downloaded from the store. (The company says 99 percent of developers qualify for a fee of 15 percent or lower on in-app purchases. Larger app makers like Epic must pay 30 percent.)

The simultaneous antitrust suits underscore how Google is playing defense on multiple fronts as regulators and competitors try to chip away at its influence over the internet.
Part of a wider effort by tech regulators in recent years to curb the ever-increasing power of Big Tech, the lawsuits are potentially damaging distractions for Google when it is trying to focus on competing with Microsoft, OpenAI and others in the emerging field of generative artificial intelligence.
“It’s hard to imagine Google makes it out of the gauntlet” unscathed in the next year, said Paul Swanson, an antitrust lawyer from the firm Holland & Hart. “At some point with this many cases, one breaks against you.”
Even so, Epic faces an uphill battle. It brought similar claims against Apple in a 2021 trial that featured squabbling over a cartoon Fortnite banana and the first court appearance by Tim Cook as Apple’s chief executive, but a federal judge rejected most of Epic’s arguments.

This trial has key differences that make Epic think it has a shot. For one, the case will be decided by a jury rather than a judge. Epic also will point to what it believes are damning pieces of evidence, arguing that Google forced phone makers like Samsung to pre-install and promote its apps on their devices. It will argue that a Google program called Project Hug paid off some developers so they would continue using Google’s payment system. Epic is also being countersued by Google, which is seeking damages.

Mr. Swanson said a jury trial could be beneficial for Epic.
“Google faces a much larger risk when they are up against a bunch of normal folks who are assessing their behavior versus judges assessing the behavior through a lens of a century of antitrust jurisprudence,” he said.
Over time, the antitrust claims against the Play Store have been whittled down to a one-on-one confrontation between Google and Epic. In 2021, dozens of state attorneys general sued Google on similar grounds. Google reached a tentative settlement with the group in September. On Tuesday, Google also announced a settlement with Match Group, the dating app company, which had joined Epic’s case.
“Epic wants all the benefits of Android and Google Play without having to pay for them,” Wilson White, a Google vice president of public policy, said during a briefing with reporters. “The lawsuit would upend a business model that has lowered prices and increased choices.”
In 2020, Epic antagonized Google and Apple by encouraging its customers to sidestep the tech giants and pay Epic directly for purchases made in Fortnite, the animated battle royale game. That was a violation of both companies’ rules, so they kicked Fortnite out of their app stores.

Epic responded with lawsuits and a public relations blitz that focused on Apple. Fortnite was still available on Android phones because Google allows a practice called sideloading — downloading apps from the internet outside a phone’s app store.
Epic is expected to argue that Google has made life tough on both Android phone users and app developers through a variety of means. Sideloading, Epic will argue, is an arduous process that most phone users struggle with, meaning that Google can maintain de facto control over what apps are on its phones through its Play Store restrictions. Samsung also offers an app store on its Android devices.

The stock price of Match Group, which owns dozens of online dating services including Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid, Hinge and Plenty of Fish, fell more than 15 percent on Wednesday, a day after the company lowered its 2023 revenue projections in its third-quarter earnings report. The number of users paying for Tinder fell 6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, Match said.
Ms. Jones, a native of Brazil, took the helm at Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, in January. Before that, she was an executive at Salesforce and spent nearly 13 years at Microsoft. She told The Wall Street Journal that she was focused on how Bumble could use artificial intelligence to accelerate matchmaking on the app.

2023-11-08,"When Sarmad Gilani joined Google as a software engineer in 2012, he was drawn by the company’s famously open culture, where employees can publicly criticize leadership and are encouraged to embrace their racial identity and sexual orientation while at work.
He said certain political positions, like support for Black Lives Matter or Ukraine, were usually met with agreement and even embraced by the company. But there was one topic Mr. Gilani was always wary of raising: The treatment of Palestinians.

“You have to be very, very, very careful, because any sort of criticism toward the Israeli state can be easily taken as antisemitism,” he said in an interview. Mr. Gilani, a 38-year-old American born to Pakistani immigrants, explained that his caution was also informed by a lifetime of being misunderstood and profiled for being Muslim.
That was before Oct. 7.
In the month since Hamas launched an attack inside Israel, and Israel retaliated with a bombing campaign and invasion of the Gaza Strip, discussion of the topic at Google — for Muslims and Jews — has sunk into a morass of hostility and intolerance, Mr. Gilani and other employees say.
Israeli and Jewish employees have expressed anger over messages posted in Google’s internal channels, including at least one that was overtly antisemitic, and on Wednesday a group of workers published an open letter addressed to Google leadership accusing the company of a double standard that allows for “freedom of expression for Israeli Googlers versus Arab, Muslim and Palestinian Googlers.”
The letter was not signed by any individuals. Instead it was attributed to “Muslim, Palestinian and Arab Google employees joined by anti-Zionist Jewish colleagues.” The New York Times discussed the matter with seven Google employees and reviewed messages posted in employee channels for this article. A few of the employees, including Mr. Gilani, were willing to be identified, but others asked not to be named out of concern for professional ramifications.
Pro-Palestinian employees say the company has allowed supporters of Israel to speak freely about their opinions on the topic, while taking a heavy hand with Muslim employees who have criticized Israel’s retaliation in Gaza.

“I do not feel safe saying what I want to say,” Mr. Gilani said in an interview before the letter was published.
Google said the acrimony described to The Times by both Muslim and Jewish employees was limited to a small group of its many thousands of workers.
“This is a highly sensitive time and topic in every company and workplace, and we have many employees who are personally affected,” Courtenay Mencini, a company spokeswoman, wrote in an emailed response to questions. “The overwhelming majority of those employees are not engaged in internal discussions or debate, and many have said they’ve appreciated our fast response and our focus on the safety of our employees.”
Google isn’t alone in facing this turmoil. The topic has exposed rifts at other elite institutions in the United States — colleges, Hollywood and the Democratic Party, to name a few — as declarations of solidarity for Palestinians or calls for an Israeli cease-fire are met with condemnation as undermining Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorism.
Businesses are struggling with how to address the conflict and to draw clear boundaries around acceptable speech on the topic. More broadly, anger over the conflict has led to a rise in hate crimes and threats against both Jews and Muslims.
Among technology companies, Microsoft has taken down some posts by workers discussing the conflict, and at Meta, internal tensions also rose as the company removed internal employee messages supporting other Palestinians at Meta.

But at Google, the issue has a unique meaning.
Israel-Hamas War: Live Updates
Updated

Hezbollah’s leader says it will fight without ‘constraints, rules, or limits’ if attacked by Israel.
Without a plan for Gaza, ‘we will get Hamas’ again, Hagari said.
Thousands of tons of aid are stranded because distributing them is too dangerous, relief groups say.
Even compared with its Silicon Valley peers, Google has become a hub for employee activism, a legacy of the company’s open and informal founding culture.
In recent years, Google employees have protested former President Donald J. Trump’s ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries, walked out to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment, formed a union and petitioned leadership to stop working with the Pentagon.
The letter sent on Wednesday resurfaces another sore point: Google’s role in a $1.2 billion contract to supply Israel and its military with artificial intelligence and other computing power, technology that critics and activists say could be used to surveil Palestinians.
When the contract, called Project Nimbus, took effect in 2021, a number of employees objected publicly and said they were threatened for speaking out in support of Palestinians, claims that are similar to those in Wednesday’s letter. Last year, a Jewish employee of Google who led an effort to get the company to drop out of the contract resigned, claiming it had retaliated against her.
After the fighting broke out last month, employees started a new petition for Google to cancel Nimbus. By Tuesday, it had 675 signatures, according to one of the employees.
“Criticizing Project Nimbus has made people targets,” said Rachel Westrick, a software engineer at Google who said she supported the letter. Ms. Westrick said she also wanted the company to condemn the violence against Palestinians, as it did the attack by Hamas, and address racism that she says her colleagues have experienced.
The company has said Google’s role in Nimbus involves it providing services for run-of-the-mill government agency work and isn’t applied to highly sensitive or classified projects.
Israel’s supporters see calls to drop Nimbus, and other efforts to boycott the country, as hostile to the Jewish state. Jewish and Israeli workers also said the language that their colleagues were using was deeply offensive, in particular when Israel’s actions in Gaza were described as a “genocide.”
One Israeli employee said that, in her view, the company had allowed a lot of pro-Hamas statements to spread inside of Google’s internal communication platforms unchecked. Google is slower to internally acknowledge anything regarding Israel, in this worker’s view, compared with issues like Black Lives Matter and violence against Asian Americans.
Three people said one worker had been fired after writing in an internal company message board that Israelis living near Gaza “deserved to be impacted.”
The company released a statement condemning Hamas on Oct. 7, and a few days later it told Jewish employees that it was monitoring internal platforms for antisemitism and promised to take action — including firing offenders — if warranted.
The next week, in an email to staff, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, acknowledged that Jewish employees were “experiencing a rise in antisemitic incidents,” and that Palestinian, Arab and Muslim employees were “deeply affected by a concerning rise in Islamophobia and are watching with dread as Palestinian civilians in Gaza have suffered significant loss and fear for their lives amid the escalating war and humanitarian crisis.”
But the employees behind Wednesday’s letter say this isn’t enough: “We demand that Sundar Pichai, Thomas Kurian and other Google leadership issue a public condemnation of the ongoing genocide in the strongest possible terms,” it reads. Mr. Kurian is chief executive of Google’s cloud computing business.
Supporters of Palestinians at Meta also feel they are facing unfair treatment. A handful of workers there reported that on Workplace, Meta’s internal communication platform, posts that included the phrase “pray for Palestine” or otherwise expressed support for Palestinians — with no mention of Hamas — were being flagged for removal internally, according to two employees who shared the messages with The Times.
Around the same time that Meta’s workers were having difficulties internally, the company said a “bug” in its code — a mistranslation of Arabic — had led to the word “terrorist” being inserted in some users’ Instagram biographies if they included the word “Palestine” or a Palestinian flag emoji. The Washington Post and 404 Media earlier reported on some of the problems at Meta.
A Meta spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. Gilani said he couldn’t figure out what, if anything, he could say at work about what he saw as the killing of innocent civilians.
He knows the risks of speaking out on such a divisive topic, thanks in part to an experience he had in 2014. After he was repeatedly stopped by airport security, he filed a Freedom of Information Act request to try and find out if he was on a watch list. But instead of getting the information, he was approached and questioned by the F.B.I. at Google’s offices.
But now, he said, he’s worried that retaliation against Muslim employees is having a chilling effect on speech at Google, and he has developed a playbook for how to speak on the subject at work: Condemn Hamas and move on.
“It feels like I have to condemn Hamas 10 times before saying one tiny, tiny thing criticizing Israel.”

2023-11-09,"In an open-air warehouse in California’s Central Valley, 40-foot-tall racks hold hundreds of trays filled with a white powder that turns crusty as it absorbs carbon dioxide from the sky.
The start-up that built the facility, Heirloom Carbon Technologies, calls it the first commercial plant in the United States to use direct air capture, which involves vacuuming greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Another plant is operating in Iceland, and some scientists say the technique could be crucial for fighting climate change.
Heirloom will take the carbon dioxide it pulls from the air and have the gas sealed permanently in concrete, where it can’t heat the planet. To earn revenue, the company is selling carbon removal credits to companies paying a premium to offset their own emissions. Microsoft has already signed a deal with Heirloom to remove 315,000 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
The company’s first facility in Tracy, Calif., which opens Thursday, is fairly small. The plant can absorb a maximum of 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, equal to the exhaust from about 200 cars. But Heirloom hopes to expand quickly.

“We want to get to millions of tons per year,” said Shashank Samala, the company’s chief executive. “That means copying and pasting this basic design over and over.”
The idea of using technology to suck carbon dioxide from the sky has gone from science fiction to big business. Hundreds of start-ups have emerged. The Biden administration in August awarded $1.2 billion to help several companies, including Heirloom, build larger direct air capture plants in Texas and Louisiana. Companies like Airbus and JPMorgan Chase are spending millions to buy carbon removal credits in order to fulfill corporate climate pledges.
Critics point out that many artificial methods of removing carbon dioxide from the air are wildly expensive, in the range of $600 per ton or higher, and some fear they could distract from efforts to reduce emissions. Environmentalists are wary of oil companies investing in the technology, fearing it could be used to prolong the use of fossil fuels.
Others say it’s essential to try. Nations have delayed cutting greenhouse gas emissions for so long, scientists say, that it is almost impossible to keep global warming at relatively tolerable levels unless countries both cut emissions sharply and also remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by midcentury, far more than can be achieved by simply planting trees.

“The science is clear: Cutting back carbon emissions through renewable energy alone won’t stop the damage from climate change,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who planned to attend the opening of Heirloom’s facility, said. “Direct air capture technology is a game-changing tool that gives us a shot at removing the carbon pollution that has been building in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.”

Carbon-absorbing rocks
Heirloom’s technology hinges on a simple bit of chemistry: Limestone, one of the most abundant rocks on the planet, forms when calcium oxide binds with carbon dioxide. In nature, that process takes years. Heirloom speeds it up.
At the California plant, workers heat limestone to 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit in a kiln powered by renewable electricity. Carbon dioxide is released from the limestone and pumped into a storage tank.
The leftover calcium oxide, which looks like flour, is then doused with water and spread onto large trays, which are carried by robots onto tower-high racks and exposed to open air. Over three days, the white powder absorbs carbon dioxide and turns into limestone again. Then it’s back to the kiln and the cycle repeats.
“That’s the beauty of this, it’s just rocks on trays,” Mr. Samala, who co-founded Heirloom in 2020, said. The hard part, he added, was years of tweaking variables like particle size, tray spacing and moisture to speed up absorption.

The carbon dioxide still needs to be dealt with. In California, Heirloom works with CarbonCure, a company that mixes the gas into concrete, where it mineralizes and can no longer escape into the air. In future projects, Heirloom also plans to pump carbon dioxide into underground storage wells, burying it.
Heirloom won’t disclose its exact costs, but experts estimate that direct air capture currently costs around $600 to $1,000 per ton of carbon dioxide, making it by far the most expensive way to curb emissions, even after new federal tax credits worth up to $180 per ton.
Heirloom has set a long-term target of $100 per ton and aims to get there, in part, through economies of scale and mass-produced components. For its next plant, planned in Louisiana, Heirloom will use a more efficient kiln and a denser layout to save on land costs.
“We’ve seen this with solar panels, with gas turbines. As you deploy more, the costs come down,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist of Carbon Direct, a consulting firm. “There are lots of reasons to think it can happen here, too.”
Finding enough clean power for the energy-intensive process could be a challenge. In California, Heirloom paid a local provider to add more renewable electricity to the grid. But experts say care is needed to ensure that direct air capture plants don’t inadvertently cause emissions from the electricity sector to rise by diverting wind or solar power from elsewhere.

“If a company says it’s removing a ton of carbon dioxide, it’s important to make sure everything gets accounted for,” said Danny Cullenward, a research fellow with the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University. “That’s not always as easy as it sounds.”

Paying for carbon removal
Even if direct air capture remains expensive, some customers are willing to pay.
Microsoft, which is Heirloom’s biggest customer, has set a goal of going carbon negative by 2030. That means first doing everything it can to cut emissions, like powering data centers with renewable electricity. But the company also wants to offset emissions from activities that aren’t easy to clean up, like the production of the cement it uses, and plans to compensate for its historical emissions.
Microsoft won’t buy traditional offsets, such as paying people to protect forests, because they are difficult to verify and may not be permanent. Pulling carbon dioxide from the air and burying it seemed more durable and easier to measure.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“Carbon removal can be a lot more expensive than offsets, but what you’re paying for in terms of climate impact is radically different,” said Brian Marrs, Microsoft’s senior director of energy and carbon.
It’s too early to predict which carbon removal technologies will work best, Mr. Marrs said, so the company is investing in a variety of approaches besides Heirloom’s. That includes a different direct air capture project in Wyoming and a start-up claiming to remove atmospheric carbon by burying seaweed deep in the ocean.
“The more innovation we can see in this space, the better,” Mr. Marrs said.
To date, however, only a small number of wealthy companies have been willing to pay for engineered carbon removal.
In an attempt to build confidence in the market, the Energy Department in September announced it would buy $35 million worth of carbon removal credits from up to 10 providers, in order to establish new guidelines around what counts as a “high quality” project.
“Carbon removal is getting a lot attention, but there aren’t yet enough buyers out there to get to the scale we need,” said Noah Deich, deputy assistant secretary for the Energy Department’s Office of Carbon Management. “We’re trying to change that.”

The oil question

Heirloom stands out in another way. In October, the company publicly pledged that it won’t accept investments from oil and gas companies or use its technology to enable fossil fuel production.
That appeared to be a response to one company in particular: Occidental Petroleum, an oil and gas giant that has emerged as a leading player in direct air capture. The company’s chief executive, Vicki Hollub, has said the technology could “preserve our industry,” a statement that alarmed environmentalists.
Occidental is building a different type of direct air capture plant in West Texas that can absorb 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. The company then plans to inject some of the gas into depleted oil wells in order to extract more crude, a practice known as enhanced oil recovery. Occidental said that emissions from the new oil would be offset by the injected carbon dioxide that remained underground, creating a carbon-neutral fuel that could be used in airplanes or ships that are difficult to decarbonize.
Energy forecasts say the world will be using millions of barrels of oil for years to come. “For us, it’s about solving atmospheric carbon dioxide,” said Richard Jackson, Occidental’s president of United States onshore resources and carbon management. “And things like net-zero oil and gas could be a meaningful way, especially in the near term, to support that.”

Mr. Jackson added that Occidental’s vision for direct air capture was still evolving. The company will also bury much of the carbon dioxide it captures in underground saline aquifers, in order to sell carbon removal credits.
Still, Occidental’s oil proposal sparked a backlash. “There’s a big difference between exploring an infant technology to see if it can be developed, versus telling the public, ‘If we do this, we can continue burning fossil fuels forever,’” former Vice President Al Gore said at a recent New York Times event.
The debate over how big a role carbon removal should play in tackling climate change is still in early stages, said Emily Grubert, associate professor of sustainable energy policy at the University of Notre Dame. But with billions of dollars rushing in, she said, it’s a crucial discussion.
“Using direct air capture to offset large amounts of oil production is a completely different scale than using it to offset a few activities, like fertilizer use, where it’s impossible to cut emissions,” Dr. Grubert said. “And there’s a broad societal interest in figuring out what scale of carbon removal we’re committing to.”"

Leaving the door open to more rate rises?

Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times
A multi-headed strike to the markets
The S&P 500 was on its way to a ninth straight day of gains on Thursday when investors got hit by a double whammy: a lackluster auction for 30-year Treasury bonds and more hawkish words from Jay Powell, the Fed chair, that prompted a sell-off in stocks and bonds.
The snapped winning streak — which would have been the index’s longest since 2004 — was a reminder that inflation and global growth concerns remain high, especially given the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Stock futures this morning are pointing to another weak open.
Powell hasn’t dismissed the possibility of raising rates. The subdued jobs report released last week led many on Wall Street to predict that the Fed would stop increasing borrowing costs. Not so fast, the central bank’s chief suggested at an event hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
He called out the “head fakes” posed by fluctuating inflation data, and reiterated that the door remained open for further interest rate increases. (Speaking of doors: Powell appeared to lose his cool when climate change protesters disrupted his speech, issuing a profanity as they were escorted off the stage.)

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
“If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,” Powell said, adding that the central bank’s goal to push inflation down to its 2 percent target “is not assured.”
Another shock came from a dud of an auction for 30-year Treasury notes. The scheduled event wrapped up shortly before Powell spoke, with fairly tepid investor uptake. The weak demand sent yields spiking for long-duration government bonds; bond yields rise when prices fall.
Wall Street is also on high alert for hackers. It emerged on Thursday that the U.S. unit of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, considered the world’s biggest financial institution, was hit by a ransomware attack that sent ripple effects through the bond markets. (It’s not clear if that was enough to torpedo Thursday’s lackluster Treasury auction.)
The bank was unable to settle several big trades, including in U.S. Treasury bonds, throughout the day, according to Bloomberg. (Security experts suspect LockBit, a cybercrime group.) To limit market disruption, the bank put the details for trade settlements on a USB drive, and had a messenger deliver it to clients so they could close out the transactions.
Such cyberattacks have been on the rise lately. Still, security experts found the effect of this outage surprising. “We don’t often see a bank this large get hit with this disruptive of a ransomware attack,” Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future told Reuters.

JPMorgan Chase’s settlement with victims of Jeffrey Epstein is approved. A federal judge gave the green light to the $290 million agreement, which will resolve claims that the bank ignored warnings about the disgraced financier. The settlement closes a chapter in the Epstein ordeal centering on the role of big banks enabling his conduct for nearly two decades.
Las Vegas avoids a potentially crippling labor strike. Unions representing hospitality workers agreed to new contracts with Wynn, the lone holdout among the city’s three big casino operators, hours before they were set to walk off the job. A work stoppage would have hit the city’s economy on the eve of big events that are set to be held there starting next week.
AstraZeneca gets into the anti-obesity race. The drugmaker said it had licensed a pill from China’s Eccogene that could see it pay up to nearly $2 billion if certain testing milestones are reached. The pill could eventually rival the weight-loss drugs from Novo Nordisk that have drastically bolstered that company’s fortunes.

Will the most consequential senator turn spoiler?
News on Thursday that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia won’t seek re-election was another blow to Democrats. The conservative lawmaker has been a thorn in progressives’ sides, even as he was key to passing some of President Biden’s biggest legislative accomplishments.
Even worse for Biden, Manchin says he’s still weighing a presidential run — potentially costing the president support he needs to win re-election.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Manchin has been one of the most powerful lawmakers of the Biden era. Often by working with mainstream Republicans, the senator had an outsize role in shaping legislation. Few were more significant than the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest investment in clean energy in U.S. history, despite his avowed defense of his home state’s coal industry. (It was probably because of Manchin that the bill gained its name.)
But progressives have accused Manchin of holding Biden back, forcing the president to pursue less aggressive spending on green energy and social programs.
He was perhaps the only Democrat who could hold onto his Senate seat, given that Donald Trump won West Virginia in 2020 by about 39 percentage points. (Even so, Manchin was trailing his likely Republican opponent, Gov. Jim Justice.)
Democrats who already face an uphill battle to preserve their razor-thin Senate majority now have additional pressure to protect Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, whose states Trump won in 2020. The party’s only (slim) chances of flipping Republican-held Senate seats are in Texas and Florida.
Will Manchin siphon off support for Biden’s re-election bid? In his announcement on Thursday, Manchin said he wanted to “see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together.”
If he runs as a third-party candidate — in association with the billionaire-backed No Labels group — he could draw voters away from Biden. That said, it would be expensive for Manchin to run, especially this late, and highly unlikely that he would win.
In other Washington news, House Republicans again appear divided over federal spending bills, with a potential government shutdown looming next week.

Women’s soccer scores a big deal
The National Women’s Soccer League announced a four-year broadcast rights deal on Thursday worth a reported $60 million a year, 40 times as much as the last deal the competition signed with CBS Sports in 2020. The huge jump in value reflects the resilience of live sports broadcasting and surging consumer and investor interest in the league — a remarkable turnaround after it was on the brink of closing just a few years ago.
The new deal is with CBS Sports, ESPN, Amazon and Scripps Sports. The involvement of mainstream sports broadcasters is a far cry from a decade ago, when most of the league’s games were aired for free on YouTube. But attendance at games is now breaking records, and media groups hope that they can convert that enthusiasm into viewership.
Professional women’s sports leagues are more established than ever. The W.N.B.A. too landed a new deal this year reportedly worth $60 million annually with Scripps Sports’ Ion TV network, and also airs games on ESPN. “It’s not the old days where if you wanted to watch women’s sports, you had to navigate your way through a million backdoor channels to find the content,” Jessica Berman, N.W.S.L.’s commissioner, told The Wall Street Journal.
And big name investors are paying more to be part of the N.W.S.L. Three years ago, the price for entry to create a new club was about $2 million to $5 million. But this year, starting a new franchise cost about $50 million, and the league will expand to 14 teams next year.
Sixth Street, the investment firm, bought the rights this year to start a new franchise for about $53 million in the Bay Area. Alexis Ohanian, the Reddit co-founder, is the lead investor in Angel City F.C., a franchise based in Los Angeles, alongside a host of Hollywood celebrities like the actors Natalie Portman and Jessica Chastain.

Can carbon capture from the skies turn a profit?
Few green technology breakthroughs have attracted quite as much funding and scientific scrutiny as direct air capture.
These giant installations that pull greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere have become a favored technology of energy and financial giants — BlackRock this week said it would invest $550 million in Occidental Petroleum’s carbon-capture projects — the Energy Department and green tech start-ups.
Now in the spotlight is Heirloom Carbon Technologies, which recently opened the first commercial capture plant in the country. The plant, in California, can absorb and remove up to 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, equal to the exhaust from about 200 cars. The Times’s Brad Plumer visited the plant and reports on the buzz around, and the skepticism behind, direct air capture.
The idea of using technology to suck carbon dioxide from the sky has gone from science fiction to big business. Hundreds of start-ups have emerged. The Biden administration in August awarded $1.2 billion to help several companies, including Heirloom, build larger direct air capture plants in Texas and Louisiana. Companies like Airbus and JPMorgan Chase are spending millions to buy carbon removal credits in order to fulfill corporate climate pledges.

Environmentalists are wary of oil companies investing in the technology, fearing it could be used to prolong the use of fossil fuels.

Trying to set a floor under U.S.-China relations
Nine months after the Chinese spy balloon controversy sent relations between Washington and Beijing to a new low, President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, will meet this week in San Francisco for face-to-face talks.
The summit won’t end the standoff between the world’s biggest economies. But it’s a sign that Biden and Xi want to maintain ties, despite trade tensions, tit-for-tat sanctions and questions about the future of Taiwan — and business leaders will be hoping for some sign of a thaw.
Talk is about derisking, not decoupling. Officials have been at pains to emphasize that the U.S. and China are competitors rather than zero-sum rivals. “We have a $700 billion trading relationship with China. The vast majority — 99 percent of that — has nothing to do with export controls,” Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, told CNN this weekend. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, has called the countries “economically interdependent” and Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, has warned that economic separation “would have significant global repercussions.”
Xi told a visiting U.S. congressional delegation last month that there were “a thousand reasons to make U.S.-China relations better, and no reason to make them worse.”

Can they find common ground? The U.S. hopes to resume military communications that were broken off after Representative Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year. Biden may reassert American support for the “one China” policy that recognizes Beijing as the sole government of China, while warning Xi against interfering in Taiwan’s presidential election next year. And the U.S. will hope for cooperation on tackling climate change and fentanyl trafficking (China is a big source of the drug used in opioid production).
Where does this leave business? Xi will hold a banquet with U.S. executives after the summit, an effort to show that his country is open to foreign businesses.
Many Western companies say it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate in China. But some of Wall Street’s top bosses attended a financial industry summit in Hong Kong last week, suggesting that they aren’t about to leave. Still, there was little talk about the challenge of doing business in China, and in a sign of the sensitivity, reporters weren’t even allowed in the room to ask questions.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Senator Tim Scott suspends his 2024 presidential campaign. The South Carolina Republican announced the effective end of his primary run, as polls show that Donald Trump is leading the G.O.P. field by double digits. Scott initially stood out for his Reagan-esque happy-warrior message, but he failed to gain much traction in the polls; a super PAC, largely backed by Oracle’s Larry Ellison, said last month that it was cutting a planned multimillion-dollar ad spend.
Ford and General Motors employees reject proposed labor contracts. Production workers at two Ford plants in Kentucky voted against the deal that the U.A.W. struck with the carmaker late last month, joining union members at a G.M. plant in Flint, Mich. The moves raise questions about the fate of those contracts, which are meant to end the U.A.W.’s financially punitive strike against the big Detroit automakers.

Smartphone Ban: Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a statewide ban on smartphone use in schools, joining a growing national effort to curb cyberbullying and classroom distraction by limiting access to the devices.
A Foreboding Fire: A wildfire that quickly consumed more than 14,000 acres northwest of Los Angeles signaled the start of what experts warn could be a dangerous and prolonged fire season in the West.
Tiny Homes: As the Supreme Court weighs whether cities can criminalize sleeping outdoors or in tents, Los Angeles is attempting to combat homelessness with tiny homes criticized by some as “inhumane.”

Adams’s campaign is facing a public corruption inquiry related to illicit donations from Turkey.
The latest Marvel movie disappoints at the box office. “The Marvels” grossed $47 million at U.S. and Canada box offices this weekend, the lowest debut in the 33-part Marvel Cinematic Universe. That underperformance is fueling more concern that Disney’s biggest blockbuster factory is faltering as audiences tire of superhero movies.

The Wegovy boom continues
Shares in Novo Nordisk jumped more than 3 percent on Monday, extending an extraordinary yearlong rally. The cause: results of a study published this weekend (funded by the drugmaker) that showed its wildly popular weight-loss treatment Wegovy reduces the risks of heart disease and stroke in some patients.
It’s the latest good news for Novo Nordisk and Wegovy, one of a new class of weight-loss drugs that analysts and experts say could transform health care — and a wide swath of businesses — in just a few years.

Doctors described the news as a breakthrough. “We’ve just identified a new best practice,” Dr. Clyde Yancy, chief of the division of cardiology at Northwestern Medicine, told The Times. Dr. Yuan Lu, an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, predicted “skyrocketing” Wegovy prescriptions in the coming years.
The study of 17,000 adults found that Wegovy, a so-called GLP-1 drug created to fight diabetes, reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular issues by 20 percent among overweight people with heart disease.

The medicine isn’t without risks. Over 16 percent of trial participants suffered side effects like vomiting and diarrhea, forcing them to drop out. (Some doctors downplayed this outcome, saying such symptoms could be avoided or minimized by tweaking the prescribed medication.)
It’s also not clear how Wegovy improves heart health, and whether it would show success outside the trial.
Investors have high hopes for GLP-1 drugs. Shares in Novo Nordisk have jumped more than 50 percent this year on the strength of sales of Wegovy and the related treatment Ozempic, making it Europe’s most valuable publicly traded company. The company said last week that it would spend $6 billion on a new manufacturing plant to meet soaring demand.

Makers of other GLP-1 drugs have also seen a boom. Eli Lilly, whose Mounjaro is also seen as highly promising, has enjoyed a stock rise nearly as high as Novo Nordisk’s. Richard Vosser, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, has forecast that Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly would make up nearly half of the GLP-1 market, which could hit $71 billion by 2032.
Pfizer and AstraZeneca are betting on oral versions of GLP-1 drugs.

And companies producing traditional weight-loss treatments have been hammered. Herbalife and Medifast, which make diet products and nutritional supplements, have seen their shares plummet as GLP-1 drugs grow in popularity.
Remote working was supposed to help women. Did it?
Before the pandemic, women often felt compelled to opt out of the work force because traditional careers and office norms left little room to accommodate child care. (Those who tended to succeed in 9-to-5 jobs, according to the legal scholar Joan Williams, were men whose wives did not work.)
To many, the rise of remote working signaled a possibility that things were changing. But as more companies push employees to return to the office, those who aren’t back full time are seen as less serious or unambitious.
DealBook’s Sarah Kessler took a look at how new working patterns could still lead to women being relegated to the so-called mommy track:
Most post-pandemic debate around remote work has focused on whether it’s here to stay. Some version of it seems likely: About 70 percent of workers who can do their jobs off-site still work remotely either all or some days. Job satisfaction is at the highest it’s been in the 36 years the Conference Board has tracked the metric, and it’s highest among workers who do some work remotely.
But if old attitudes about more flexible work resurge — outspoken executives have recently described it as “lazy,” not for leaders and a perk for those who don’t “work as hard”— then it may not matter if hybrid options are widespread. In the end, Ms. Williams said, they may “just be strengthening the invisible escalator for white men.”
But there are nuances to the argument as well, according to Claudia Goldin, the Harvard professor who won the Nobel for economics in October for her research on the gender pay gap. “It could lead to a female enclave who work at home more than most men,” she said. “But the question is whether that is worse than having the same women be part-time.”

Tuesday: All eyes are on Consumer Price Index data. Economists have forecast little to no month-on-month change in “core” inflation (which strips out food and fuel prices) for October. On an annualized basis, that figure is likely to have risen 4.1 percent, well above the Fed’s target of 2 percent.
On the earnings front, Home Depot reports third-quarter results.
Wednesday: Inflation hawks will most likely zero in on retail sales and producer price index data, which are scheduled for release. Britain, where inflation is running hot, is also scheduled to release C.P.I. data. Earnings-wise, there’s Target and Cisco.
Thursday: Walmart reports results.
Friday: It’s déjà vu in Washington, where the federal government will shut down if Congress does not reach an agreement on a federal spending plan by midnight. A complex proposal by House Republicans over the weekend was met by skepticism by the White House and Senate Democrats.

2023-11-14,"Two weeks ago, Google had a big day in Washington. President Biden signed an executive order to create artificial intelligence safeguards that could affect Google’s most pressing projects, and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken gave the company an award for its work in aiding Ukrainian refugees and promoting women’s economic security.
Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, had spent much of the day on a witness stand at a federal courthouse about two miles from the White House, defending his company from claims that it crushed rivals in the search and online advertising markets.
On Tuesday, Mr. Pichai testified again, this time in San Francisco, to confront claims brought by the video game company Epic Games that his company broke the law, wielding monopolistic power over app developers on Android’s Google Play Store.
Mr. Pichai over the last month has become the face of Google’s antitrust court fights on both sides of the country. And his visits to the witness stand underscore the growing importance for Big Tech leaders to be sharp witnesses for their companies, whether in an antitrust trial or in hearings on Capitol Hill.

Testifying under oath is a task that many tech chief executives might be asked to do in the coming years, with Amazon, Meta and others facing their own antitrust court fights. It is not a task at which many executives have excelled.
Though he was never called to the witness stand to testify, Bill Gates, who was chief executive of Microsoft in the last big technology antitrust case brought by the Justice Department more than two decades ago, came across as combative and evasive in depositions.
Over the last few years, executives including Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI’s Sam Altman (and, of course, Mr. Pichai) have been asked to testify before Congress for various reasons, with varying degrees of success. Mr. Zuckerberg has at times exasperated lawmakers with vague responses, while Mr. Altman appeared to charm senators in a hearing this year.
The main duty on the witness stand for Mr. Pichai — a low-key and detail-focused executive — has been to keep the temperature low under questioning and keep to the central point of Google’s antitrust defense: that it is an innovative company that has maintained its leadership through innovation and hard work instead of illegal monopolistic behavior.
On Tuesday, Mr. Pichai ran into aggressive questioning by a lawyer for Epic, Lauren Moskowitz, who asked him to provide yes-or-no responses.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That led to at least one small revelation: Mr. Pichai confirmed that his company gave Apple 36 percent of the search revenue generated on iPhones, and said the total payment “was well over $10 billion” last year. Ms. Moskowitz asserted that the figure was at least $18 billion.
Lawyers for Google and Apple fought on Tuesday morning to keep the figures concealed, emphasizing a need for corporate privacy that has carried through both of Google’s trials. Judge James Donato rejected their requests, saying, “Just coming in and saying we’re kind of sensitive with this isn’t going to fly.”
Ms. Moskowitz was trying to counter Google’s claim that it cannot be considered a monopoly because of its rivalry with Apple. If that were the case, she argued, why did it give Apple preferential treatment over other companies like Samsung, which she said received a 16 percent share of the search revenue from its devices?
“We compete fiercely with Apple, at the operating system, the smartphone and the app store level,” Mr. Pichai said later, when questioned by a Google lawyer. “The competition has been good for consumers and developers.”
The Justice Department filed its landmark antitrust suit against Google in October 2020, arguing that the company’s default-search deals with phone makers and browser companies helped it illegally maintain a monopoly.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Google called Mr. Pichai, 51, to the stand two weeks ago. Rather than sit in the witness box, Mr. Pichai stood at a lectern for almost four hours, wearing a microphone, as though he were delivering a speech at a corporate conference. His handlers said he had to stand because of a sprained lower back.
He spoke of his background, getting a telephone as a preteen in Chennai, India, and understanding then the power of technology, before he deftly answered questions about his company’s competitive standing, relationship with Apple and the default-search contracts the government argues were illegal.
Mr. Pichai tried to refute the government lawyer’s arguments that Google paid Apple billions of dollars a year to keep it out of the search market. He presented a different story, saying his company wanted to be the iPhone’s default search engine because of the “value” of that spot, and the need to ensure Apple would safeguard the user experience.
“I felt the deal had done well since 2016,” Mr. Pichai said. “It was continuing to increase search usage, search revenue.”
In cross-examination, Mr. Pichai repeated the rationale for the deal so many times that for a moment, he seemed to lose patience with the line of questioning, saying, “I just gave all the reasons” for the deal.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Adam Kovacevich, a tech industry lobbyist at the Chamber of Progress who spent 12 years working at Google, said Mr. Pichai’s testimony gave the court a high-level view of how the company made strategic decisions.
“He did fine,” Mr. Kovacevich said of Mr. Pichai’s performance. “The biggest thing to me is when you’re in that position, your first objective is to not be Bill Gates in the Microsoft trial. Your No. 1 objective is to come off as responsive and reasonable.”
Excerpts from Mr. Gates’s combative, videotaped testimony were shown in court more than two decades ago. The Microsoft co-founder, antitrust lawyers say, undermined his and his company’s credibility with the judge in the case.
In San Francisco, Mr. Pichai was questioned on topics ranging from why he erroneously marked emails as subject to attorney-client privilege (to prevent them from being forwarded) to whether Facebook and Amazon could have provided competition to Google’s Play Store when they had smartphone ambitions.
“There are nuances in these questions,” he said with a smile when Ms. Moskowitz started to speak over him. “I’m trying to answer your question.”
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Several times, Judge Donato asked Ms. Moskowitz to “be quiet” to let Mr. Pichai speak.
There will be one big difference between the lawsuits: The antitrust trial in Washington does not have a jury. The decision will be made by a judge. In San Francisco, Mr. Pichai had to appeal to a nine-person jury that could be open to the idea that a giant tech company is exploiting much smaller outfits. Tim Sweeney, Epic’s chief executive, is also expected to testify in the trial.
Google and Epic declined to comment.
Epic, the maker of the hit game Fortnite, brought the claim against Google in 2020, in an attempt to sidestep the 15 to 30 percent fees from subscriptions and in-app purchases that it must pay Google.
The game developer antagonized Google and Apple by telling users to pay for in-app transactions directly through Epic. In response, Google and Apple suspended Fortnite from their app stores. Epic claims Google also bullied other companies to force them to drop deals with Epic before it was banned from the app stores.
Google faces another Justice Department antitrust lawsuit that accuses it of illegally abusing its monopoly power over the technology that delivers ads online.
A trial in that case could begin as soon as next year, but it is too early to know whether Mr. Pichai will be called to testify.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Mr. Pichai has tried to prevent Google employees from being distracted by the litigation. He has encouraged them to “keep doing what you’re doing” and has allocated a relatively small number of employees to work on the Justice Department case — hundreds out of more than 180,000.
But Mr. Pichai’s court appearances have taken time away from his other obligations as a company leader, including his plan to reclaim Google’s primacy in the fast-growing field of generative A.I.
In the middle of Mr. Pichai’s October testimony, the secretary of state, Mr. Blinken, was honoring Google’s subsidiary in Poland for its work in fostering women’s economic security and helping Ukrainian refugees. Hours later, Mr. Biden hosted a signing ceremony at the White House, but Mr. Pichai’s handlers could not R.S.V.P. yes because there was a chance he might have still been in court when it began.
“It’s not the best use of his time,” Richard Kramer, an analyst at Arete Research, a London-based investment research firm, said in an interview. “No C.E.O. wishes to spend their time being grilled by government lawyers.”"

Upbeat investors see Tuesday’s inflation data as a possible turning point in the Fed’s battle against soaring prices.

Good news for global markets
Yesterday’s impressive rally in U.S. stocks and bonds has gone worldwide this morning, as investors see central banks making gains in their fight against inflation. Adding to the good news was a breakthrough in the House last night that could avert a government shutdown.
S&P 500 futures signal further gains at the opening bell. The question now is whether this represents a false dawn on inflation, or the start of a durable decline in rising costs — and interest rates.
Here’s what’s exciting investors: Yesterday’s cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index data has shifted discussion in the markets from potential interest rate hikes to cuts, and what that might mean for stocks. President Biden, whose poll ratings have been hurt by inflation, also cheered the numbers.
Other promising data points came out this morning. Inflation in Britain fell to its lowest level in two years. And consumer spending and industrial output in China rebounded last month, a hopeful sign for the world’s No. 2 economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Market optimists have moved up their bets on rate cuts. Futures markets this morning pointed to the Fed starting to lower borrowing costs by May, sooner than previous estimates of closer to the end of 2024.
Less aggressive is Mohit Kumar, the chief financial economist at Jefferies, who wrote today that big rate cuts would begin after the presidential election next year. Jefferies predicts the Fed’s prime lending rate going to 3 percent by the end of 2025 from its current level of 5.25 to 5.5 percent.
Others are more cautious. Pessimists note that the “core” inflation data in yesterday’s C.P.I. reading, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, was just a tenth of a percentage point below estimates. “I’m afraid that inflation may not go away that quickly,” Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase told Bloomberg Television.
Washington gave markets another reason to cheer. The House’s passage of a stopgap spending bill appears to remove the risk of a shutdown, which has been seen as a potential drag on the U.S. economy.
But even here, political tensions in Congress — including some threats of physical violence — provide reason to be cautious. (Remember that last week Moody’s lowered its U.S. credit outlook to negative, citing “continued political polarization” in Congress hampering legislation.) The House funding bill required Democratic support to pass, and Politico reports that hard-right Republicans may hold the House hostage with a flurry of procedural votes.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The U.S. and China strike a climate agreement. The countries pledged to ramp up their use of wind, solar and other renewable energy sources in hopes of displacing fossil fuels, ahead of a meeting between President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, in San Francisco today. Among the American C.E.O.s set to meet with Xi are Elon Musk of Tesla, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil.
The F.D.I.C.’s chair faces tough questioning over the agency’s culture. Senators asked Martin Gruenberg yesterday about how the regulator handles accusations of harassment and discrimination after The Wall Street Journal reported on toxic work conditions there. (“What the hell is going on at the F.D.I.C.?” asked Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.) Gruenberg said he was “personally disturbed” by the report and was conducting an internal review.
The Times takes a close look at David Zaslav. The Times Magazine published an in-depth profile of the Warner Bros. Discovery C.E.O., while another article looks at his tumultuous oversight of CNN. One question raised by the pieces: Will the debt-laden Warner Bros. Discovery soon be up for sale? “It’s there for the taking,” Barry Diller, the media mogul, told The Times. “Whether that will happen depends on whether someone wants to take it. Saudi Arabia? Don’t laugh.”
Rory McIlroy resigns from the PGA Tour’s board. The pro golfer stepped down five months after the tour announced an agreement with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the backer of LIV Golf, to try to create a joint company that would end the sport’s money-fueled battle for supremacy. McIlroy has been among LIV’s most outspoken critics of that effort. Meanwhile, the PGA Tour said it would give players equity in that combined company if it’s formed.

Banking’s A.I. leaders and laggards
As the promises of artificial intelligence and its transformation potential grow, banks are among the businesses racing to incorporate the technology into almost everything they do.
But in its latest ranking of how the industry is adopting A.I., the data start-up Evident found a growing gap between the leaders and everyone else. Its founders shared the new report first with DealBook.

The methodology: Evident rates institutions on four main areas — talent, innovation, leadership and transparency — using publicly available data like news releases, research papers and job data. The company nearly doubled the number of banks it rates to 50, by expanding eligibility to institutions with $200 billion in total assets and including lenders in the Asia-Pacific region.

Early adopters have extended their leads. While all banks have committed to A.I. — “I don’t think there’s a single bank in the index that hasn’t doubled down on A.I.,” said Alexandra Mousavizadeh, Evident’s C.E.O. — some are clearly ahead. JPMorgan, which led the last survey, was again on top, ranking first or second in each of the four main criteria.
But Capital One, a smaller U.S. rival and a new entrant to the list, came on strong. It ranked first in talent, with the highest proportion of A.I. developers and engineers to overall head count of any institution. And it has hired Prem Natarajan, a former executive at Amazon’s Alexa business, as its chief scientist and head of enterprise A.I.

Europe has some strong performers, including UBS, which retained much of Credit Suisse’s A.I. talent when it bought its Swiss rival. But many of the region’s lenders still prioritize specific solutions over comprehensive plans, according to Annabel Ayles, Evident’s co-C.E.O.
Canadian lenders continue to punch above their weight, ranking strongly across the talent, leadership and transparency and ethics criteria. “Some of the highest quality patents come from Canada,” Ayles said.

Haley’s rising fortunes may draw more big backers
Things are looking up for Nikki Haley in the Republican presidential primary (relatively speaking, given Donald Trump’s dominance). Her poll numbers have risen in recent weeks on the back of strong performances in the G.O.P. debates, as rivals like Tim Scott drop out of the race.
Now reports suggest that Haley may be gaining ground in another important area: backing from deep-pocketed corporate donors.

Ken Griffin of Citadel is close to deciding whether to back her. “We’re at the finish line on that choice,” the billionaire financier told Bloomberg Television yesterday. Griffin, who has said he wouldn’t back Trump, is one of the most prolific Republican donors, having given around $72.7 million in the 2022 election cycle alone.
His support could provide Haley with crucial financial ballast as she battles Ron DeSantis to become the leading anyone-but-Trump candidate.
And Haley has reportedly impressed Jamie Dimon, according to Axios. An unnamed source told the publication that the JPMorgan Chase C.E.O. — who has given to both Democrats and Republicans in recent election cycles — liked her positions on the economy and the role of business in governing.
Haley already has support from notable wealthy donors, including the oil magnate Harold Hamm, Jim Haskel of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and the deal maker Aryeh Bourkoff.
How Microsoft’s 1990s case could apply to Google
A two-month Google antitrust trial is nearing its conclusion in Washington while the search giant faces a separate legal challenge in a San Francisco courtroom, where it’s accused of wielding monopolistic power over the running of its app store.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
One of the government’s last major wins against Big Tech came against Microsoft in the 1990s. That fight has loomed large in the Google trial, writes Steve Lohr for The Times: The Justice Department and a group of states say Google is running something similar to the Microsoft monopoly playbook in dominating the search market. Google rejects that analogy.
Those cases have these things in common:
Digital platform economics: The Microsoft case highlighted the power of the “network effect,” in which a digital product becomes more valuable the more people use it. In the Google case, the government argues that the huge search usage gives Google more data to train and improve its search algorithms.
That, in turn, attracts more users and advertisers. Google has argued that its in-house innovation and investment account for its market lead.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Contracts with competitors: With Microsoft, deals with personal computer makers and internet service providers were a big focus. Some of those partners felt that they had to strike a deal with Microsoft to get access to its Windows desktop software, prime virtual real estate in the early days of the web.
Google’s case involves big payments — known as pay-for-default contracts — to Apple, Samsung, Mozilla and others to make Google the featured search engine on their devices and browsers.
A potential outcome: If the government and states prevail in the Google case, a potential remedy could involve the banning of pay-for-default deals. That, too, would mirror the outcome in the Microsoft case, where the company was prohibited from making exclusive deals that thwarted competition.

Xi Jinping of China and President Biden are seeking to stabilize relations between the world’s two biggest economies.

Doug Mills/The New York Times
Biden and Xi try direct diplomacy
The mood music was upbeat but pragmatic after the first face-to-face meeting in a year between President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. There was no joint communiqué after Wednesday’s talks, but both sides issued positive statements trumpeting where they found common ground, including on tackling climate change and improving communications.
The San Francisco summit, and Xi’s banquet with American business leaders afterward, were signs of how entwined the economies remain despite years of rising tensions — and why both sides and many U.S. companies don’t want the relationship spiraling into a more serious conflict.
Biden and Xi found room for cooperation. The leaders agreed to restart military communications that were suspended last year after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House, visited Taiwan. Biden said they had made progress on curbing Chinese production of the opioid fentanyl.
But there was plenty they didn’t agree upon. Xi complained that U.S. export controls on advanced technology, such as semiconductors, were intended to suppress China. Biden’s effort to enlist Beijing as a kind of peacekeeper in the Middle East — specifically, putting pressure on Iran to not escalate the Israel-Hamas war — was unsuccessful.
And the two sides didn’t make much progress on systems to ban the use of artificial intelligence to manage their nuclear arsenals, agreeing only that their officials would keep talking.
Xi got a standing ovation from top American business executives. Larry Fink of BlackRock and Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone reportedly sat at the Chinese leader’s table. The exclusive dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel also included Tim Cook of Apple, Albert Bourla of Pfizer and Ray Dalio of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. Xi’s message: China is a market that’s open to foreign business.
Xi wants to portray China as a friend to foreign companies — because he needs them. The Chinese economy is struggling and foreign direct investment recently hit a 25-year low. A meeting with American corporate leaders is a good image to project to his audience back home.
But Western businesses say it’s tougher to operate there, with many rethinking their supply chains or pulling out altogether.
Yet the dinner showed that many aren’t ready to quit China. For all of the talk about decoupling and de-risking, “China is still enormously important for just about any multinational you can think of,” Richard McGregor, a China expert at the Lowy Institute, an Australia-based think tank, told DealBook. “They might not be investing as much, but they’re not getting out. And it’s a market they can’t ignore and have to try and manage.”

Israel and Hamas appear closer to a hostage deal. Israeli officials say the proposal would see the group free about 50 women and children in exchange for a pause in fighting and the release of roughly the same number of Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.
The Senate approves a spending bill that would keep the government open. The measure would keep the federal government funded through early next year, clearing the way for President Biden to sign the legislation. But the bill excludes more contentious items, including aid for Ukraine and Israel, and Congress will have to negotiate again on funding in a few months.
Another activist investor targets Disney. ValueAct Capital has amassed a stake in the entertainment giant, DealBook hears, confirming a report by 13D Monitor. It joins Nelson Peltz’s Trian in seeking to shake up Disney amid investor dissatisfaction with the company’s performance.

Too close to call
The fate of the United Automobile Workers union’s tentative contract with General Motors, won after a hard-fought strike, now looks uncertain. Workers at the automaker have unexpectedly pushed back against the terms, prolonging the drama around the Detroit auto industry.
The final tally on the contract could be a squeaker, with results expected as soon as Thursday. Veteran G.M. workers have opposed the deal, which would raise the top wage by 25 percent, to more than $40 per hour over the next four and a half years, as well as offer cost-of-living adjustments and more generous pension and retirement plans.
A majority of workers at several G.M. plants in Michigan, Indiana and Tennessee rejected the proposal, while those at a large sport utility vehicle plant in Arlington, Texas, voted yes. (A simple majority is needed for ratification.)
One G.M. worker told The Times that he rejected the agreement because it didn’t include retiree health benefits. “I’m not voting yes on any contract that doesn’t have that in it because I don’t need the health care when I’m 25 — I’m 65,” he said.
Workers at Ford and Stellantis seem set to approve the deal. That appears to validate the U.A.W.’s decision to strike at all three automakers this fall to exert more pressure, creating a work stoppage that cost the companies billions of dollars.
That hardball strategy, coupled with similarly tough moves by unions of Hollywood screenwriters and actors, helped workers in both industries achieve some of their biggest wage gains and benefits increases in decades.
But those concessions won’t matter if union members won’t accept them. That could create issues for the U.A.W. as well as G.M. Shawn Fain, the union’s president, has hoped to build on the victory by seeking to organize workers at nonunionized automakers like Tesla and Toyota.
The White House could also suffer blowback. President Biden has embraced a pro-union stance as part of his 2024 re-election campaign, including by taking the extraordinary step of joining its picket line in September. Last week, he joined Fain at a Stellantis factory in Illinois, where — wearing a U.A.W. T-shirt — he lauded the union’s gains.
But his position could become thorny if G.M. workers reject their union’s deal. And any disruption that arises from new labor tension could compound voters’ concerns about his handling of the economy.
Musk takes heat for comments about hate speech, again
As corporate America rushes to stand up against antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war, Elon Musk is taking a different tack.
The billionaire on Wednesday reignited concerns about his efforts to combat antisemitism with a series of replies to posts on X, the social network he owns, criticizing the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, and seemingly endorsing a claim that some Jewish communities are pushing hate speech.
“You have said the truth,” Musk wrote in a reply to an X post that said Jewish communities “have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” (The author of the original post has since limited who can see it.)
Musk added, without citing evidence, that the A.D.L. “unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel.” He later said that not all Jewish communities promote hate, but reiterated that the A.D.L. and similar groups are pushing “de facto anti-white racism or anti-Asian racism or racism of any kind.”
The A.D.L., which did not appear to respond to Musk’s latest charge, on Wednesday called out the “record levels” of hate speech generated in online forums and social media.
It’s the latest instance of Musk taking aim at the A.D.L., which is one of several groups cataloging hate speech on X. The social network has faced criticism over a surge in racist, antisemitic and other harmful content since Musk took over last year, charges that the tech mogul has strongly disputed. “The @ADL has been trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it & me of being anti-Semitic,” he wrote in September. He later threatened to sue the organization for hurting X’s revenue; the two sides later backed down.
The controversy is unlikely to help X’s already embattled business, which many advertisers had abandoned after upheaval at the company and a weakening of its content moderation teams and policies. Last month, X disclosed that it now valued itself at $19 billion, a fraction of the $44 billion that Musk paid for the company.
In other Musk news: He denied a report by Bloomberg that SpaceX was weighing an initial public offering of its Starlink satellite internet service as soon as next year.

2023-11-17,"Sam Altman, the high-profile chief executive of OpenAI, who became the face of the tech industry’s artificial intelligence boom, was pushed out of the company by its board of directors, OpenAI said in a blog post on Friday afternoon.
The move set off a reshuffling at OpenAI, a groundbreaking A.I. company and the maker of the popular chatbot ChatGPT. Mira Murati, previously OpenAI’s chief technology officer, was named interim chief executive officer, the company said. Hours later, Greg Brockman, the company’s president, said he was quitting.
“Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities,” the company said. “The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.”
Leaving OpenAI is a stunning fall for Mr. Altman, 38, who over the last year had become one of the tech industry’s most prominent executives as well as one of its most fascinating characters. Last fall, OpenAI launched an industrywide A.I. frenzy when it released ChatGPT.

It was not immediately clear what had led to the board’s decision beyond what its statement said. Mr. Altman could not be immediately reached for comment. In a post to X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: “i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what’s next later.”
In a post to X Friday evening, Mr. Brockman said that he and Mr. Altman had no warning of the board’s decision. “Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,” he wrote. “We too are still trying to figure out exactly what happened.”"
2023-11-18,"For the last month, an under-the-radar lawsuit has privately been a hot topic of conversation in Fortune 500 boardrooms and corporate security departments.
In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued a software company hacked by Russian agents in 2020, accusing it of defrauding investors by not disclosing allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.
The lawsuit named not just the company, SolarWinds, but also its chief information security officer, Timothy Brown. A year earlier, a former chief security officer at Uber, Joe Sullivan, was found guilty of failing to disclose a data breach to federal regulators. Executives heading up cybersecurity have a sense that their personal risk is increasing.
“I’ve been doing this for 25 years, and I’ve always been protecting others,” said George Gerchow, the chief security officer and senior vice president of information technology at Sumo Logic, a software company. “Now, all of a sudden, I’m in a weird position where I’m having to protect myself.”

Perhaps more alarming to boardrooms is that SolarWinds did disclose some cybersecurity risks — in the same way that just about all public companies do.
“You can track it across a hundred different companies, that they’re all basically using the exact same language,” said Josephine Wolff, an associate professor of cybersecurity policy at Tufts University.
Now it seems the S.E.C. no longer considers those boilerplate disclosures to be sufficient if the company knows of more specific risks. The lawsuit is the first in which the S.E.C. has charged a company with intentional fraud related to cybersecurity disclosures, according to the law firm White & Case.
In his first interview since the S.E.C. complaint, the C.E.O. of SolarWinds, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, told DealBook that the company hadn’t known about the issue that exposed it to the cyberattack in 2020, and that the lawsuit was “an attempt, we believe, by the S.E.C. to advance policy.”
The lawsuit could “actually make CISOs more fearful, not more emboldened to raise their voice,” he said.

Most experts agree that, regardless of the lawsuit’s outcome, it could affect how companies handle cybersecurity risks. But they’re divided over whether it will encourage better or worse practices.
The lawsuit is not the only sign the S.E.C. is paying attention to cybersecurity. In July, the agency adopted new cybersecurity disclosure requirements set to take effect in December. They require companies to report material attacks within four days and to make yearly disclosures about their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. In a June speech, the S.E.C.’s enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, said it had “zero tolerance for gamesmanship” around cybersecurity disclosures.
Some experts worry that the lawsuit could have a chilling effect. “There were some serious warning signs that he and his team had surfaced,” Wolff said of the SolarWinds CISO. “And now that’s being used against him specifically to say, ‘You knew about this, you didn’t disclose it in the S.E.C. filings.’ Which I think really does create an incentive to never document or never find any vulnerabilities anywhere.” That could make it difficult for the I.T. department to ask for money for cybersecurity, she said.
Ramakrishna, the SolarWinds C.E.O., said that being expected to disclose every potential security vulnerability could make it easier for attackers to abuse them. “For one, it’ll be too many for the average investor to understand,” he said. “For another, I think we’ll be playing into the hands of the threat.”
Others argue that the threat of S.E.C. action could empower executives in charge of cybersecurity. Jake Williams, a security expert who consults with companies when they’ve experienced a data breach, said he regularly saw CISOs being asked to “paint a rosy or maybe rosier-than-aligned-with-reality picture.” But he added: “That practice, I think, died the day the SolarWinds lawsuit was filed by the agency. No CISO can now risk basically painting an unrealistically positive picture of cybersecurity.”
Harley Geiger is a lawyer who specializes in cybersecurity at the law firm Venable and is part of the team representing a coalition of tech companies including Cisco, Broadcom, Microsoft and Google. He said there were ways for CISOs to react to increased personal risk other than avoiding documentation of concerns and recommendations, including by erring on the side of escalating risks and vulnerabilities.
“They may want to be covered by a company’s insurance policy. They may want indemnification in their employment contracts,” Geiger said. “I think it would be the wrong message for or the wrong takeaway for CISOs to choose to ignore or not escalate material cybersecurity information.”

An inflation surprise ignites a market rally. The Consumer Price Index report released on Tuesday showed that inflation cooled last month more than analysts had expected, helped by a fall in energy prices. Investors cheered the news as a bevy of Wall Street economists concluded that the Federal Reserve was most likely done with raising interest rates.
Another Republican drops out of the presidential race. Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, suspended his campaign this week. He and the rest of the Republican field have trailed Donald Trump by double-digit margins for months. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, had a better week. She appeared to be close to winning over big conservative donors, including Ken Griffin of Citadel.
Trump’s social media platform is struggling. Trump Media & Technology Group, the firm that runs Truth Social, has racked up big losses and may not survive without new funding, a regulatory filing this week disclosed. Truth Social has been pinning its future on a long-delayed merger with a shell company meant to take it public, giving it access to roughly $300 million in funding.

An A.I. pioneer on her life and science
When Fei-Fei Li, co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, showed the first draft of her book project to one of her colleagues, he told her to throw it away.
“He said that there’s a lot of scientists who can write about the ideas of technology,” Li told DealBook. But the colleague added that “my unique personal journey, as an immigrant, as a woman, as someone whose coming-of-age as a scientist is so intertwined with the coming-of-age of modern A.I., would give even those who are not traditionally in the world of tech a voice to identify with.”
Li persevered, and the book, “The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI,” was published this month, telling the story of the growth of A.I. and her own story as an immigrant from China who became one of the world’s leading experts in the field.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
What should a business leader take away from your book?
There’s so much debate and confusion and, frankly, anxiety around A.I. Part of the anxiety comes from not knowing what it is. Part of it comes from not knowing what it’s going to do. I hope this book sort of dispels both.
Tools are made by humans, designed by humans, used by humans. We have responsibilities as well as agency.
You write about the complex consequences of commercial investment in A.I. Can you tell me more about that?
At the beginning of my career, it was just pure scientific inquiry, curiosity. Nobody was paying attention. As A.I. became more powerful, as more resources from the industry poured into it, as its social impact was surfacing — it is a natural course of a profound technological change that it brings complexity.
Our ecosystem of innovation in America is hopefully driven by a combination of private sector, public sector and government. Right now, we have an imbalance. I’m hoping the public sector can still be a trusted source of evaluating and assessing and understanding and explaining this technology, but also be at the forefront of scientific discovery for the public good.

What risks are you most focused on?
I personally focus on societal risks, from disinformation to bias and privacy, infringement to job disruption, to weaponization.
I do think there is responsibility, especially for the media, as well as the government, to engage in this discourse responsibly. I’m concerned when the media is biasing their megaphones to very few voices that are much more hyperbolic, focusing on existential crises, rather than the real social risks that will deeply impact everyday people, especially people from underserved communities.
Is the government doing enough?
President Biden’s executive order was a good first step because it’s broad and relatively balanced. But that truly is a first step. What is really important is to have the humility, especially for policymakers and business leaders, to recognize that this is new. So learn about what this is before making policy.

DealBook readers respond: Sam Bankman-Fried
As crypto crime watchers know, Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Nov. 2 for his role in the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. The big question remaining: How long of a prison term will the 31-year-old get?
The maximum term is more than 100 years. Last Saturday, we asked DealBook readers what would be a fair sentence. Many respondents shared their view that the judge should not go easy on Bankman-Fried at the sentencing hearing, scheduled for March.
Here’s a selection of what readers had to say about Bankman-Fried, the American justice system and the wider cryptocurrency market:
“Perhaps because I am a former prosecutor, I believe white-collar criminals should be sentenced on a par with violent ones, or perhaps more severely because the societal impacts are generally broader and the mitigating factors (socioeconomic status, etc.) are less compelling.” — Ted Baker
“What about the crypto investors who got fleeced; how does locking him up help them? Retributive justice and rehabilitation don’t speak in any way to making the investors as whole as possible.” — Thomas Haible
“I think a factor is that crypto is primarily a fixation of gamblers. Call them traders. Call them investors. But they’re not. They’re bettors.” — Barry Morse

2023-11-19,"Talks at OpenAI to bring back Sam Altman, the artificial intelligence start-up’s recently ousted chief executive, continued into Sunday evening but there were disagreements over the makeup of the company’s board of directors, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
Mr. Altman, 38, spent the weekend waging a pressure campaign on the start-up’s four-person board of directors who ousted him on Friday afternoon, three people familiar with the matter said. The result was a groundswell of support from investors, employees and OpenAI executives.
Mr. Altman was at the OpenAI headquarters on Sunday afternoon. He posted a photo of himself on X, formerly Twitter, wearing a guest identification badge and wrote, “first and last time i ever wear one of these.”
The negotiations included a look at how the company’s board of directors might be reshaped if Mr. Altman returns as chief executive, two of the people said. Members of the board have not yet agreed to what a restructured board of directors might look like — nor is Mr. Altman’s reinstatement an inevitability, two of the people said.

Mr. Altman’s return would likely include major changes to the board and the company is currently evaluating candidates, according to two people familiar with the situation. Over time, the board’s structure could change to further reflect OpenAI’s evolution from a research start-up to a commercial entity with billions in revenue and enormous ambitions.
But Mr. Altman and the investors still want to retain voices from people who are concerned about the safety of A.I. along with other board members with expertise in technology and commercializing those products, the people said.
OpenAI’s unusual governance structure, which caps its profits, could change, while retaining the checks and balances the company built on the safety of its technology, the people said. The company’s priority is to get a viable board in place by Monday morning, the people said.
Down the line, Mr. Altman and his supporters want to have the company adopt a more traditional structure to reflect its growth into a business valued at $80 billion with many customers and constituents, the people said. They said the events since Friday had been a wakeup call that OpenAI’s structure no longer worked.
There has been a whirlwind of activity since Mr. Altman was forced out of OpenAI, a company he helped found eight years ago that has become one of the most closely watched companies in tech thanks to its popular ChatGPT chatbot.

On Sunday afternoon, Will Hurd, a former OpenAI board member and a former Republican congressman from Texas, was standing outside the company’s headquarters in San Francisco’s Mission district waiting for a ride to the airport after spending two days digging into the details of Mr. Altman’s dismissal.
Mr. Hurd said that a representative of the company had called him on Friday morning, before Mr. Altman’s removal, and asked for his help in navigating the leadership upheaval. Mr. Hurd traveled from Texas to San Francisco on Saturday.
“The industry is important, the company is important,” Mr. Hurd said. “This is the future. How do we make sure there’s a level of trust and transparency? All things we want from models, we want from governance.”
OpenAI declined to comment.
OpenAI’s board of directors has an atypical structure. The organization started as a nonprofit before transforming itself into a for-profit company and bringing on Microsoft as its biggest investor. The for-profit company still answers to the nonprofit board. As a result, the company’s investors have had no official say in what happens to the start-up or who leads it.
Before Mr. Altman was forced out, OpenAI had six board members, including Mr. Altman and Greg Brockman, a company co-founder and board chairman who quit on Friday in solidarity with Mr. Altman.

The other board members are Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI co-founder; Adam D’Angelo, the chief executive of Quora, the question-and-answer site; Helen Toner, a director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology; and Tasha McCauley, an entrepreneur and computer scientist.
Since Friday, people close to the company have been trying to learn why the board dismissed Mr. Altman. Brad Lightcap, the company’s chief operating officer, said in a note to staff on Saturday that there was no “malfeasance” involved.
OpenAI’s board did not tell investors, who have poured billions into the company, what Mr. Altman did wrong. Upon learning of news of his ouster, many investors began a push — in private communications and publicly via social media — to get the board to reverse its decision.
Many reached out to Microsoft, because it is OpenAI’s biggest shareholder and had the most leverage with the company.
The stalemate is the latest twist in a series of power struggles at OpenAI. The fight drew attention to a longtime rift in the A.I. community between people who believe A.I. is the biggest business opportunity in a generation and others who worry that moving too fast could be dangerous.

The company was recently in talks to raise a new funding round that would value the company at more than $80 billion. Bloomberg News earlier reported some of the details of the discussions.
Mr. Altman’s potential reinstatement would be a dramatic reversal for OpenAI, which said he had not been “consistently candid” in his discussions with the board when it unceremoniously ousted him.
As deliberations continued on Sunday, executives at OpenAI called in resources. At 12:45 p.m., a deliveryman with a dozen drinks from the Boba Guys chain showed up on a motorbike outside with two bags. Another deliveryman followed later with a half dozen more drinks.
At 6:15 p.m., a food delivery driver pulled up at the rear entrance and jumped out with four bags from McDonald’s. Two employees from OpenAI loaded them on carts and wheeled them inside for what looked to be a long night."
2023-11-20,"Microsoft, the technology giant that ranks as one of the world’s most valuable companies, was shaken by the upheaval at OpenAI, the small but influential artificial intelligence start-up that developed the ChatGPT chatbot, before it found a way out of the turmoil that propelled its shares to a new high.
The unexpected ouster on Friday of Sam Altman, OpenAI’s co-founder and chief executive, set off a chain of events that erased tens of billions from Microsoft’s market value, a sign of how important OpenAI is to the tech behemoth. Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, and Apple, Google and Meta have rushed to catch up with their own A.I. offerings.
Microsoft’s stock has been on a roller coaster since Mr. Altman’s departure from OpenAI, dropping on Friday and continuing to slide in after-hours trading. Over the weekend, the company led an effort to try to convince OpenAI’s board to reinstate Mr. Altman, a charismatic, well-connected founder in Silicon Valley.
In the end, Microsoft said late on Sunday that it would hire Mr. Altman and Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president and a company co-founder who quit in solidarity with Mr. Altman. The two men will lead an advanced research lab at Microsoft, “setting a new pace for innovation,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive.

On Monday, Microsoft’s stock recovered the ground it had lost, and then some: It rose more than 2 percent to a record high, as analysts praised the company for hiring the OpenAI outcasts.
The rally extended past Microsoft, with other A.I.-related companies, including the chip-makers Nvidia and Broadcom, reaching new highs as well. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index was up 1.13 percent at the close on Monday.
Microsoft’s stock had been on a steep rise for the past month after it reported a boom in profit in its most recent quarter. The company’s price per share at the end of the trading day on Monday was $377.44, beating its previous record of about $376.20 set on Thursday.
“While the events over the weekend were surprising and concerning, ultimately we believe Microsoft is actually in a stronger position now than before when it comes to A.I.,” analysts at RBC wrote in a research note.
Nearly all of OpenAI’s staff, including those in the top ranks, signed a letter to the board threatening to leave the start-up for Microsoft if Mr. Altman isn’t reinstated as the company’s leader. That list included OpenAI’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, who is a board member.

“We think Mr. Nadella may have pulled off his own coup, acquiring the most important part of OpenAI: its ambitious talent,” said researchers at Macquarie. And some believe that the high-stakes drama over control of OpenAI could, ultimately, be a good thing for companies like Microsoft that are commercializing their A.I. capabilities. “This publicity will draw further investment and enterprise attention to A.I.,” according to analysts at Oppenheimer.
OpenAI named its second interim chief executive in two days, tapping Emmett Shear, the former chief executive of Twitch. Mira Murati, a longtime OpenAI executive, was initially made interim chief after Mr. Altman’s departure.

2023-11-21,"Before Sam Altman was ousted from OpenAI last week, he and the company’s board of directors had been bickering for more than a year. The tension got worse as OpenAI became a mainstream name thanks to its popular ChatGPT chatbot.
At one point, Mr. Altman, the chief executive, made a move to push out one of the board’s members because he thought a research paper she had co-written was critical of the company.
Another member, Ilya Sutskever, thought Mr. Altman was not always being honest when talking with the board. And some board members worried that Mr. Altman was too focused on expansion while they wanted to balance that growth with A.I. safety.
The news that he was being pushed out came in a videoconference on Friday afternoon, when Mr. Sutskever, who had worked closely with Mr. Altman at OpenAI for eight years, read him a statement. The decision stunned OpenAI’s employees and exposed board members to tough questions about their qualifications to manage such a high-profile company.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Those tensions seemingly came to an end late Tuesday when Mr. Altman was reinstated as chief executive. Mr. Sutskever and others critical of Mr. Altman were jettisoned from the board, whose members now include Bret Taylor, an early Facebook officer and former co-chief executive of Salesforce, and Larry Summers, the former Treasury Department secretary. The only holdover is Adam D’Angelo, chief executive of the question-and-answer site, Quora.
The OpenAI debacle has illustrated how building A.I. systems is testing whether businesspeople who want to make money from artificial intelligence can work in sync with researchers who worry that what they are building could eventually eliminate jobs or become a threat if technologies like autonomous weapons grow out of control.
OpenAI was started in 2015 with an ambitious plan to one day create a superintelligent automated system that can do everything a human brain can do. But friction plagued the company’s board, which hadn’t even been able to agree on replacements for members who had stepped down.
Before Mr. Altman’s return, the company’s continued existence was in doubt. Nearly all of OpenAI’s 800 employees had threatened to follow Mr. Altman to Microsoft, which asked him to lead an A.I. lab with Greg Brockman, who quit his roles as OpenAI’s president and board chairman in solidarity with Mr. Altman.

The board had told Mr. Brockman that he would no longer be OpenAI’s chairman but invited him to stay on at the company — though he was not invited to the meeting where the decision was made to push him off the board and Mr. Altman out of the company.
OpenAI’s board troubles can be traced to the start-up’s nonprofit beginnings. In 2015, Mr. Altman teamed with Elon Musk and others, including Mr. Sutskever, to create a nonprofit to build A.I. that was safe and beneficial to humanity. They planned to raise money from private donors for their mission. But within a few years, they realized that their computing needs required much more funding than they could raise from individuals.
After Mr. Musk left in 2018, they created a for-profit subsidiary that began raising billions of dollars from investors, including $1 billion from Microsoft. They said that the subsidiary would be controlled by the nonprofit board and that each director’s fiduciary duty would be to “humanity, not OpenAI investors,” the company said on its website.

Among the tensions leading up to Mr. Altman’s ouster and quick return involved his conflict with Helen Toner, a board member and a director of strategy at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. A few weeks before Mr. Altman’s firing, he met with Ms. Toner to discuss a paper she had co-written for the Georgetown center.

Mr. Altman complained that the research paper seemed to criticize OpenAI’s efforts to keep its A.I. technologies safe while praising the approach taken by Anthropic, a company that has become OpenAI’s biggest rival, according to an email that Mr. Altman wrote to colleagues and that was viewed by The New York Times.
In the email, Mr. Altman said that he had reprimanded Ms. Toner for the paper and that it was dangerous to the company, particularly at a time, he added, when the Federal Trade Commission was investigating OpenAI over the data used to build its technology.
Ms. Toner defended it as an academic paper that analyzed the challenges that the public faces when trying to understand the intentions of the countries and companies developing A.I. But Mr. Altman disagreed.
“I did not feel we’re on the same page on the damage of all this,” he wrote in the email. “Any amount of criticism from a board member carries a lot of weight.”
Senior OpenAI leaders, including Mr. Sutskever, who is deeply concerned that A.I. could one day destroy humanity, later discussed whether Ms. Toner should be removed, a person involved in the conversations said.

But shortly after those discussions, Mr. Sutskever did the unexpected: He sided with board members to oust Mr. Altman, according to two people familiar with the board’s deliberations. The statement he read to Mr. Altman said that Mr. Altman was being fired because he wasn’t “consistently candid in his communications with the board.”
Mr. Sutskever’s frustration with Mr. Altman echoed what had happened in 2021 when another senior A.I. scientist left OpenAI to form  Anthropic. That scientist and other researchers went to the board to try to push Mr. Altman out. After they failed, they gave up and departed, according to three people familiar with the attempt to push Mr. Altman out.
“After a series of reasonably amicable negotiations, the co-founders of Anthropic were able to negotiate their exit on mutually agreeable terms,” an Anthropic spokeswoman, Sally Aldous, said. In a second statement, Anthropic added that there was “no attempt to ‘oust’ Sam Altman at the time the founders of Anthropic left OpenAI.”
Vacancies exacerbated the board’s issues. This year, it disagreed over how to replace three departing directors: Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a Microsoft board member; Shivon Zilis, director of operations at Neuralink, a company started by Mr. Musk to implant computer chips in people’s brains; and Will Hurd, a former Republican congressman from Texas.
After vetting four candidates for one position, the remaining directors couldn’t agree on who should fill it, said the two people familiar with the board’s deliberations. The stalemate hardened the divide between Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman and other board members.

Hours after Mr. Altman was ousted, OpenAI executives confronted the remaining board members during a video call, according to three people who were on the call.
During the call, Jason Kwon, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, said the board was endangering the future of the company by pushing out Mr. Altman. This, he said, violated the members’ responsibilities.
Ms. Toner disagreed. The board’s mission was to ensure that the company creates artificial intelligence that “benefits all of humanity,” and if the company was destroyed, she said, that could be consistent with its mission. In the board’s view, OpenAI would be stronger without Mr. Altman.
On Sunday, Mr. Sutskever was urged at OpenAI’s office to reverse course by Mr. Brockman’s wife, Anna, according to two people familiar with the exchange. Hours later, he signed a letter with other employees that demanded the independent directors resign. The confrontation between Mr. Sutskever and Ms. Brockman was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
At 5:15 a.m. on Monday, he posted on X, formerly Twitter, that “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions.”"
2023-11-22,"Sam Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI’s chief executive, the company said, successfully reversing his ouster by OpenAI’s board last week after a campaign waged by his allies, employees and investors.
The company’s board of directors will be overhauled, jettisoning several members who had opposed Mr. Altman. Adam D’Angelo, the chief executive of Quora, will be the only holdover.
OpenAI had an “agreement in principle” for Mr. Altman to return as chief executive, it said in a post to X. “We are collaborating to figure out the details. Thank you so much for your patience through this.”
The return of Mr. Altman and Greg Brockman, the company’s president who had resigned in solidarity, and the remaking of the board, capped a frenetic five days that upended OpenAI, the maker of the ChatGPT chatbot and one of the world’s highest-profile artificial intelligence companies.

“I love openai, and everything i’ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together,” Mr. Altman said in a post to X, adding that he looked forward to reinforcing OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft, its biggest investor.
OpenAI’s revamped board of directors will include Bret Taylor, an early Facebook officer and former co-chief executive of Salesforce; Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary; and Mr. D’Angelo, a current board member and chief executive of the question and answer site, Quora.
Mr. Taylor will act as board chairman, the company said.
Microsoft supported the move. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said on X that he was “encouraged by the changes to OpenAI board,” calling it a “first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”
Mr. D’Angelo was leading the negotiations, according to two people in touch with the board. The general framework for the changes was in place by late Sunday, one of those people said.
Determining the composition of the board slowed down the decision to bring Mr. Altman back, according to that person and one other. OpenAI called the new board its “initial” board, indicating it could expand.

A person close to the board’s deliberations on Tuesday said that Mr. D’Angelo, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner pressed for certain concessions from Mr. Altman, including an independent investigation into his leadership of OpenAI.

In the end, Ms. Toner and Ms. McCauley agreed to step down from the board because it was clear that it needed a fresh start, this person close to deliberations said. If all of them stepped down, they worried that it would suggest the board erred even though they collectively felt they did the right thing, this person said.
The outgoing board focused on curbing Mr. Altman’s power. In addition to an investigation into his leadership, they blocked his and Mr. Brockman’s return to the board and objected to potential board members who they worried might not stand up to Mr. Altman, said this person close to the board negotiations.
OpenAI’s board surprised Mr. Altman and the company’s employees on Friday afternoon when it told him he was being pushed out. Mr. Brockman, who co-founded the company with Mr. Altman and others, resigned in protest.
The ouster kicked off efforts by Mr. Altman, 38, his allies in the tech industry and OpenAI’s employees to force the company’s board to bring him back. On Sunday evening, after a weekend of negotiations, the board said it was going to stick with its decision.

But in a head-spinning development just hours later, Microsoft said that Mr. Altman, Mr. Brockman and others would be joining the company to start a new advanced artificial intelligence lab.
Most of OpenAI’s more than 700 employees signed a letter telling the board they would walk out and follow Mr. Altman to Microsoft if he wasn’t reinstated, putting the future of the start-up in jeopardy.
Four board members — Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI founder; Mr. D’Angelo; Ms. Toner, a director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology; and Ms. McCauley, an entrepreneur and computer scientist — had initially decided to push Mr. Altman out.
But as the employee revolt grew, Mr. Sutskever had second thoughts: “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions,” he said in a message on X. He also signed the letter. Mr. Sutskever is no longer on the board but remains an OpenAI employee.
“Ilya is thrilled that Sam is back as C.E.O. and he has been working tirelessly for days to make this happen,” said Mr. Sutskever’s lawyer, Alex Weingarten. “It is what is best for the company.”

OpenAI employees had been given this week off for Thanksgiving, but many workers remained in the office or glued to their screens to follow the drama. “Thank god,” one employee said. “We’re so back,” said another.
Thrive Capital, which is leading a new funding offer that will value OpenAI at more than $80 billion, said it would continue to partner with the company “now and in the future.”
Late on Tuesday night, OpenAI employees were celebrating in the company’s office. Mr. Altman phoned a reporter at The New York Times and said: “I hope you have a lovely Thanksgiving.”"

2023-11-25,"Meta has received more than 1.1 million reports of users under the age of 13 on its Instagram platform since early 2019 yet it “disabled only a fraction” of those accounts, according to a newly unsealed legal complaint against the company brought by the attorneys general of 33 states.
Instead, the social media giant “routinely continued to collect” children’s personal information, like their locations and email addresses, without parental permission, in violation of a federal children’s privacy law, according to the court filing. Meta could face hundreds of millions of dollars, or more, in civil penalties should the states prove the allegations.
“Within the company, Meta’s actual knowledge that millions of Instagram users are under the age of 13 is an open secret that is routinely documented, rigorously analyzed and confirmed,” the complaint said, “and zealously protected from disclosure to the public.”
The privacy charges are part of a larger federal lawsuit, filed last month by California, Colorado and 31 other states in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit accuses Meta of unfairly ensnaring young people on its Instagram and Facebook platforms while concealing internal studies showing user harms. And it seeks to force Meta to stop using certain features that the states say have harmed young users.

But much of the evidence cited by the states was blacked out by redactions in the initial filing.
Now the unsealed complaint, filed on Wednesday evening, provides new details from the states’ lawsuit. Using snippets from internal emails, employee chats and company presentations, the complaint contends that Instagram for years “coveted and pursued” underage users even as the company “failed” to comply with the children’s privacy law.
The unsealed filing said that Meta “continually failed” to make effective age-checking systems a priority and instead used approaches that enabled users under 13 to lie about their age to set up Instagram accounts. It also accused Meta executives of publicly stating in congressional testimony that the company’s age-checking process was effective and that the company removed underage accounts when it learned of them — even as the executives knew there were millions of underage users on Instagram.
“Tweens want access to Instagram, and they lie about their age to get it now,” Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, said in an internal company chat in November 2021, according to the court filing.
In Senate testimony the following month, Mr. Mosseri said: “If a child is under the age of 13, they are not permitted on Instagram.”
In a statement on Saturday, Meta said that it had spent a decade working to make online experiences safe and age-appropriate for teenagers and that the states’ complaint “mischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents.”

The statement also noted that Instagram’s terms of use prohibit users under the age of 13 in the United States. And it said that the company had “measures in place to remove these accounts when we identify them.”
The company added that verifying people’s ages was a “complex” challenge for online services, especially with younger users who may not have school IDs or driver’s licenses. Meta said it would like to see federal legislation that would require “app stores to get parents’ approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps” rather than having young people or their parents supply personal details like birth dates to many different apps.
The privacy charges in the case center on a 1998 federal law, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. That law requires that online services with content aimed at children obtain verifiable permission from a parent before collecting personal details — like names, email addresses or selfies — from users under 13. Fines for violating the law can run to more than $50,000 per violation.
The lawsuit argues that Meta elected not to build systems to effectively detect and exclude such underage users because it viewed children as a crucial demographic — the next generation of users — that the company needed to capture to assure continued growth.
Meta had many indicators of underage users, according to the Wednesday filing. An internal company chart displayed in the unsealed material, for example, showed how Meta tracked the percentage of 11- and 12-year-olds who used Instagram daily, the complaint said.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Meta also knew about accounts belonging to specific underage Instagram users through company reporting channels. But it “automatically” ignored certain reports of users under 13 and allowed them to continue using their accounts, the complaint said, as long as the accounts did not contain a user biography or photos.
In one case in 2019, Meta employees discussed in emails why the company had not deleted four accounts belonging to a 12-year-old, despite requests and “complaints from the girl’s mother stating her daughter was 12,” according to the complaint. The employees concluded that the accounts were “ignored” partly because Meta representatives “couldn’t tell for sure the user was underage,” the legal filing said.
This is not the first time the social media giant has faced allegations of privacy violations. In 2019, the company agreed to pay a record $5 billion, and to alter its data practices, to settle charges from the Federal Trade Commission of deceiving users about their ability to control their privacy.
It may be easier for the states to pursue Meta for children’s privacy violations than to prove that the company encouraged compulsive social media use — a relatively new phenomenon — among young people. Since 2019, the F.T.C. has successfully brought similar children’s privacy complaints against tech giants including Google and its YouTube platform, Amazon, Microsoft and Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite."

2023-11-27,"One reason that the idea of free trade has fallen out of fashion in recent years is the perception that trade agreements reflect the wishes of big American corporations, at everybody else’s expense.
U.S. officials fought for trade agreements that protect intellectual property — and drug companies got the chance to extend the life of patents, raising the price of medicine around the world. U.S. officials fought for investor protections — and mining companies got the right to sue for billions in “lost profit” if a country moved to protect its drinking water or the Amazon ecosystem. And for years, U.S. officials have fought for digital trade rules that allow data to move freely across national borders — prompting fears that the world’s most powerful tech companies would use those rules to stay ahead of competitors and shield themselves from regulations aimed at protecting consumers and privacy.
That’s why the Biden administration, which came into office promising to fight for trade agreements that better reflect the interests of ordinary people, has dropped its advocacy for tech-friendly digital trade rules that American officials have championed for more than a decade.
Last month, President Biden’s trade representative, Katherine Tai, notified the World Trade Organization that the American government no longer supported a proposal it once spearheaded that would have exported the American laissez-faire approach to tech. Had that proposal been adopted, it would have spared tech companies the headache of having to deal with many different domestic laws about how data must be handled, including rules mandating that it be stored or analyzed locally. It also would have largely shielded tech companies from regulations aimed at protecting citizens’ privacy and curbing monopolistic behavior.

The move to drop support for that digital trade agenda has been pilloried as a disaster for American companies and a boon to China, which has a host of complicated restrictions on transferring data outside of China. “We have warned for years that either the United States would write the rules for digital trade or China would,” Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, lamented in a press statement. “Now, the Biden administration has decided to give China the pen.”

The truth is that Ms. Tai is taking the pen away from Meta, Google and Amazon, which helped shape the previous policy, according to a research paper published this year by Wendy Li, a doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who used to answer the phone and interact with lobbyists at the U.S. trade representative’s office. The paper includes redacted emails between Trump-era trade negotiators and lobbyists for Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon, exchanging suggestions for the proposed text for the policy on digital trade in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. “While they were previously ‘allergic to Washington,’ as one trade negotiator described, over the course of a decade, technology companies hired lobbyists and joined trade associations with the goal of proactively influencing international trade policy,” Ms. Li wrote in the Socio-Economic Review."
2023-11-28,"OpenAI has ChatGPT. Google has the Bard chatbot. Microsoft has its Copilots. On Tuesday, Amazon joined the chatbot race and announced an artificial intelligence assistant of its own: Amazon Q.
The chatbot, developed by Amazon’s cloud computing division, is focused on workplaces and not intended for consumers. Amazon Q aims to help employees with daily tasks, such as summarizing strategy documents, filling out internal support tickets and answering questions about company policy. It will compete with other corporate chatbots, including Copilot, Google’s Duet AI and ChatGPT Enterprise.
“We think Q has the potential to become a work companion for millions and millions of people in their work life,” Adam Selipsky, the chief executive of Amazon Web Services, said in an interview.

Amazon has been racing to shake off the perception that it is lagging behind in the A.I. competition. In the year since OpenAI released ChatGPT, Google, Microsoft and others have jumped into the frenzy by unveiling their own chatbots and investing heavily in A.I. development.

Amazon was quieter about its A.I. plans until more recently. In September, it announced that it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up that competes with OpenAI, and develop advanced computing chips together. Amazon also introduced a platform this year that allows customers to have access to different A.I. systems."
2023-11-29,"OpenAI said on Wednesday that it had completed the first phase of a new governance structure that added Microsoft as a nonvoting board member, as it works to end the divisions that fueled the ouster of Sam Altman as chief executive and sets itself up for a future as a bigger company.
In a blog post, Mr. Altman, who was rapidly reinstated last week, also outlined his priorities for OpenAI as he retakes the reins of the high-profile artificial intelligence start-up. He said the company would resume its work building safe A.I. systems and products that benefited its customers. He added that its board would focus on improving governance and overseeing an independent review of the events that led to and followed his removal as chief executive.
Microsoft expands a three-person board that OpenAI announced last week. The tech giant is one of OpenAI’s biggest investors, having committed $13 billion. Microsoft will be able to participate in OpenAI’s board meetings but not vote on business decisions.
“Part of what good governance means is that there’s more predictability, transparency and input from various stakeholders, and this seemed like a good way to get that from a very important one,” Mr. Altman said in an interview, referring to Microsoft.

The blog post was the first extensive commentary from Mr. Altman since the leadership crisis at OpenAI. Four board members fired him on Nov. 17, saying he hadn’t been “consistently candid” with them. That set off a frenzy, with more than 700 of OpenAI’s 770 employees signing a letter saying they would leave if Mr. Altman didn’t return. Within days, he reclaimed his job, and two board members said they would resign.
The drama was scrutinized because OpenAI is one of the most powerful players in artificial intelligence, a rapidly evolving technology that could help people become more productive, potentially displace jobs and be used to spread misinformation. The leadership crisis raised questions about the company’s governance structure, which is unusual because a nonprofit board is in control, as well as whether it had outgrown its roots and how it should move forward.
On Wednesday, Mr. Altman and Bret Taylor, a tech executive who has been appointed the new chairman of OpenAI, did not directly address these questions in blog posts. Without providing many specifics, they said the company would build a board that included members with expertise in technology and safety policy.
Mr. Taylor said OpenAI would remain committed to its mission of building artificial intelligence “that is safe and benefits all of humanity.”
For the foreseeable future, OpenAI’s board will consist of Microsoft; Mr. Taylor, an early Facebook officer and a former co-chief executive of Salesforce; Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary; and Adam D’Angelo, the chief executive of the question-and-answer site Quora, who was among the members who ousted Mr. Altman.

In an interview, Mr. Taylor said he and Mr. Summers would oversee the independent review and select a law firm to conduct the investigation.
Microsoft declined to comment on its board membership.
Mr. Altman said OpenAI had not lost any employees during the leadership crisis. Its executive ranks will look similar to what they were before Mr. Altman’s ouster, with Mira Murati returning to her role as chief technology officer. Mr. Altman said Greg Brockman, the company’s former chairman, will be his partner and continue in his role as president.
The future of Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist and a founder, is unclear. He was one of the board members who voted for Mr. Altman’s removal. Mr. Sutskever later said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that he regretted his role in the ouster.
In his blog post, Mr. Altman said he harbored “zero ill will towards” Mr. Sutskever and was in discussions with him about “how he can continue his work at OpenAI.”"

Elon Musk, the billionaire tech executive, stunned many with his blunt advice to advertisers who’ve fled his social media platform, X. He was interviewed by The Times’s Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times
“Is that clear?”
Andrew here. Yes, I was surprised at what Elon Musk said at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday — you can see that in the moment from our conversation when he left me temporarily speechless. But I would encourage everyone to watch the entire interview, as we covered so much more than that.
Coming into Wednesday’s DealBook Summit, few could predict what Elon Musk — whose SpaceX, Tesla and X are among the most consequential and talked-about companies in the world — would say. And the famously voluble billionaire delivered.
Yes, there was the moment when, using profane language, Musk denounced companies that had suspended advertising on X following his endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory. (He did try to clear the air, saying he hadn’t meant to support bigots. “I’m quite sorry” if he had encouraged them, he said.)
But over a 90-minute conversation, Musk touched on much more, including what drives him, his fears about artificial intelligence and more.
“Don’t advertise.” Musk accused advertisers of trying to “blackmail” him over his remarks. (Bob Iger, Disney’s C.E.O., had said earlier that being associated with X and Musk was “not a positive” for his company.) After directing expletives at those businesses, Musk then cheekily added, “Hi, Bob, if you’re in the audience.” Linda Yaccarino, X’s C.E.O. whom Musk hired to win back advertisers (and who was at the summit), later posted a more conciliatory message.
“Do you want the best car, or do you not want the best car?” Whether people love Musk or hate him, the mogul boasted about the capabilities of Tesla vehicles and SpaceX rockets.
“A philosophy of curiosity.” Pressed on what drives him, Musk turned contemplative, speaking at length about a difficult childhood and how he has grappled with an existential crisis he first felt at age 12. His answer: Ensure humanity reaches the stars and settles other planets, hence his work at SpaceX. “If you’re a single-planet civilization,” he said, “something will happen to that planet, and you will die.”
“I’m quite concerned that there’s some dangerous element of A.I. that they’ve discovered.” Asked about the recent leadership shake-up at OpenAI, which he co-founded before leaving in 2019, Musk said that he was worried about the speed at which it had been pushing innovation. He predicted that the technology could reach the point of problem-solving like the human brain — so-called artificial general intelligence — in less than three years. (Jensen Huang, the C.E.O. of the A.I. chipmaker Nvidia, reckoned that milestone would take at least a decade.)
“I think I would not vote for [President] Biden.” Musk, who has turned politically conservative in recent years, criticized the president for snubbing Tesla in the company’s green-energy initiatives, despite its leadership in electric vehicles. The billionaire also said that liberals tended to embrace censorship now, anathema to the self-described free speech “absolutist.” But when asked if he would then vote for Donald Trump, Biden’s likely Republican opponent, Musk demurred, saying only, “this is definitely a difficult choice.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Henry Kissinger dies at 100. One of America’s most powerful diplomats in recent memory, he helped reshape the world order during the Cold War, including by normalizing U.S. relations with China, brokering détente with the Soviet Union and negotiating the end of the Vietnam War. Kissinger was alternately lauded for his accomplishments and castigated for an approach that abandoned American values when deemed necessary.
The U.A.W. unveils its plan to organize nonunionized automakers. The United Automobile Workers union said it was courting potential union recruits at more than a dozen companies, including Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen, which together employ more than 150,000 workers. Separately, G.M. will cut spending at its Cruise subsidiary after pausing operations there amid concerns about the safety of its autonomous vehicles.
Disney adds two directors as activist investors circle. James Gorman, the outgoing C.E.O. of Morgan Stanley, and Jeremy Darroch, the former head of the British media company Sky, are joining the Disney board ahead of an expected fight with the financier Nelson Peltz. Disney said that Gorman would help with C.E.O. succession planning, a concern of Peltz’s.

Kamala Harris: “If I listened to polls, I would have never run for my first office or my second one, and here I am as vice president.”
The vice president conceded that the White House had “work to do” to convince voters before next year’s election that Bidenomics is working for them but dismissed polling that showed the Biden-Harris ticket trailing Trump in swing states. Harris pointed to the strong labor market and economic growth that outpaced most trading partners — revised G.D.P. numbers released on Wednesday showed the U.S. economy grew 5.2 percent last quarter — but she noted that stubbornly high inflation was weighing on American families. She also hit back at concerns about Biden’s age.

Jamie Dimon: “If you’re a very liberal Democrat, I urge you to help Nikki Haley, too. Give them a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump.”
JPMorgan Chase’s C.E.O. voiced his appreciation for Haley, the Republican presidential hopeful who has been gaining in the polls in recent weeks. When asked about the two front-runners, Biden and Trump, Dimon remarked “Oh god,” eliciting some awkward laughs from the audience. He also weighed in on the politics around so-called E.S.G. investing, vowing to “punch back” over Texas’s 2021 efforts to restrict the state’s business with financial firms that embrace environmental, social and governance policies.
Tsai Ing-wen: “My thought is that perhaps this is not a time for them to consider a major invasion of Taiwan.”
Taiwan’s president played down the chances that China would invade the island imminently, saying Beijing was focused on domestic economic and political difficulties. “I think the Chinese leadership at this juncture is overwhelmed by its internal challenges,” she said. Tsai also addressed the chips war, saying that American efforts to bolster its semiconductor sector would not harm Taiwan’s leadership position in the sector.

If you follow business or tech or artificial intelligence news at all, in recent weeks you certainly were following Sam Altman being unexpectedly fired as C.E.O. of OpenAI, and then a huge staff revolt at OpenAI where more than 95 percent of the company said it would resign if he was not reinstated. And then he was reinstated, and so this whole thing seemed to have happened for nothing.
I spent a lot of time reporting on this. And I talked to people on the Altman side of things. I talked to people on the board side of things. And the thing I am now convinced of — truly convinced of — is that there was less to it than met the eye. People saw — I saw — Altman fired by this nonprofit board meant to ensure that A.I. is built to serve humanity.
And I assumed — and I think many assumed — there was some disagreement here over what OpenAI was doing, over how much safety was building into the systems, over the pace of commercialization, over the contracts it was signing, over what it was going to be building next year, over something. And that, I think, I can say conclusively — and has been corroborated by other reporting — that was not what this was about.
The OpenAI board did not trust and did not feel it could control Sam Altman, and that is why they fired Altman. It’s not that they felt they couldn’t trust him on one thing, that they were trying to control him on X but he was beating them on X. It’s that a lot of little things added up. They felt their job was to control the company, that they did not feel they could control him, and so to do their job, they had to get rid of him.
They did not have, obviously, the support inside the company to do that. They were not ultimately willing to let OpenAI completely collapse. And so they largely — although, I think in their view not totally — backed down. One of the members is still on the board. Altman and the president of OpenAI, Greg Brockman, are off the board.
Some new board members are coming in who they think are going to be stronger and more willing to stand up to them. There’s an investigation that is going to be done of Altman’s behavior, that will be at least released to the board so they’ll I guess know what to think of him. It’s a very strange story. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s things yet to come out. But I am pretty convinced that this was truly a struggle for control not a struggle about x.
But it has been a year since ChatGPT was released. It was a weird way to mark the year, but it has been a year. A year since OpenAI kicked off the whole modern era in artificial intelligence, a year since a lot of people’s estimations of what humanity’s future looked like began to shift and cloud, and darken, and shimmer.
And so I wanted to have the conversation that many of us thought was a conversation happening here about what A.I. was becoming, how it was being used, how it was being commercialized, whether or not the path we’re on is going to benefit humanity. And so I asked my friends over at “Hard Fork,” another great New York Times podcast, to come on the show.
Kevin Roose is my colleague at The Times. He writes a tech column called “The Shift.” Casey Newton is the editor of Platformer, an absolutely must-read newsletter about the intersection of technology and democracy. And they have been following this in and out, but they’ve been closely following A.I. for the past year. So I wanted to have this broader conversation with them. As always, my email ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com.

Kevin Roose, Casey Newton, welcome to the show, my friends.
CASEY NEWTON: Hey, Ezra.
KEVIN ROOSE: Thanks for having us.
EZRA KLEIN: All right, so we’re talking on Monday, Nov. 27. ChatGPT, which kicked off this era in A.I., was released on Nov. 30, 2022. So the big anniversary party was that Sam Altman got temporarily fired and the company almost collapsed and was rebuilt over at Microsoft, which I don’t think is how people expected to mark the anniversary.
But it has been now a year, roughly, in this whole new A.I. world that we’re in. And so I want to talk about what’s changed in that year. And the place I want to begin is with the capabilities of the A.I. systems we’re seeing. Not the ones we’re hearing about, but that we know are actually being used by someone in semi real-world conditions. What can A.I. systems do today that they couldn’t do a year ago, Kevin?
KEVIN ROOSE: Well, the first most obvious capabilities improvement is that these models have become what’s called multimodal. So a year ago, we had ChatGPT, which could take in text input and output other text as the response to your prompt. But now we have models that can take in text and output images, take in text and output video, take in voice data and output other voice data.
So these models are now working with many more types of inputs and outputs than they were a year ago. And that’s the most obvious difference. If you just woke up from a year-long nap and took a look at the A.I. capabilities on the market, that’s the thing that you would probably notice first.
EZRA KLEIN: I want to pull something out about that — is that it almost sounds like they’re developing what you might call senses. And I recognize that there’s a real danger of anthropomorphizing A.I. systems, so I’m not trying to do that. But one thing about having different senses is that we get some information that helps us learn about the world from our eyes, other information that helps us learn about the world from our ears, et cetera.
One of the constraints on the models is how much training data they can have. As it becomes multimodal, it would seem that would radically expand the amount of training data. If you can have not just all of the text on the internet, but all of the audio on YouTube, or all the podcast audio on Spotify or something — or Apple podcasts — that’s a lot of data to learn about the world from, that, in theory, will make the models smarter and more capable. Does it have that kind of recursive quality?
KEVIN ROOSE: Absolutely. I mean, part of the backdrop for these capabilities improvements is this race for high-quality data. All of the A.I. labs are obsessed with finding new undiscovered high-quality data sources that they can use to train their models. And so if you run out of text because you’ve scraped the entire internet, then you’ve got to go to podcasts or YouTube videos or some other source of data to keep improving your models.
CASEY NEWTON: For what it’s worth, though, I don’t think the availability of more training data is what is interesting about the past year. I think what was interesting about ChatGPT was that it gave average people a way to interact with A.I. for the first time. It was just a box that you could type in and ask it anything and often get something pretty good in response.
And even a year into folks using this now, I don’t think we’ve fully discovered everything that it can be used for. And I think more people are experiencing vertigo every day as they think about what this could mean for their own jobs and careers. So to me, the important thing was actually just the box that you type in and get questions from.
KEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, I agree with that. I think if you had just paused there and there was no new development in A.I., I think it would still probably take the next five or 10 years for society to adjust to the new capabilities in our midst.
EZRA KLEIN: So you’ve made this point in other places, Casey, that a lot of the advances to come are going to be in user interfaces, in how we interact with these systems. In a way, that was a big advance of ChatGPT. The system behind it had been around for a while. But the ability to speak to it, or I guess write to it in natural language, it created this huge cultural moment around A.I.
But what can these A.I. products actually do that they couldn’t do a year ago? Not just how we interface with them, but their underlying capacity or power.
CASEY NEWTON: I mean, as of the Developer Day Update that OpenAI had a few weeks back, the world knowledge of the system has been updated to April of this year. And so you’re able to get something closer to real-time knowledge of world events. It has now integrated with Microsoft Bing. And so you can get truly real-time information in a way that was impossible when ChatGPT launched.
And these might sound like relatively minor things, Ezra, but you start chaining them together, you start building the right interfaces, and you actually start to see beyond the internet as we know it today. You see a world where the web, where Google is not our starting point for doing everything online. It is just a little box on your computer that you type in and you get the answer without ever visiting a web page. So that’s all going to take many years to unfold, but the beginnings of it are easy to see now.
KEVIN ROOSE: One other capability that didn’t exist a year ago, at least in any public products, is the ability to bring your own data into these models. So Claude was the first language model that I used that had the ability to, say, upload a PDF. So you could say, here’s a research paper. It’s 100 pages long. Help me summarize and analyze this. And it could do that. Now ChatGPT can do the same thing. And I know a bunch of other systems are moving in that direction too.
There are also companies that have tried to spin up their own language models that are trained on their own internal data. So if you are Coca-Cola, or B.C.G., or some other business, and you want an internal ChatGPT that you can use for your own employees to ask, say, questions about your H.R. documents, that is a thing that companies have been building. So that’s not the sexiest, most consumer-facing application, but that is something that there’s enormous demand for out there.
EZRA KLEIN: So one thing it seems to me to be getting better at, from what I can tell from others, is coding. I often ask people whether they’re using A.I. bots very often, and if so, for what? And basically nobody says yes unless they are a coder. Everybody says, oh, yeah, I played around with it. I thought it was really cool. I sometimes use DALL-E or Midjourney to make pictures for my kids or for my email newsletter. But it is the coders who say, I’m using it all the time, it has become completely essential to me. I’m curious to hear a bit about that capability increase.
KEVIN ROOSE: I think where it has become part of the daily habit of programmers is through tools like GitHub Copilot, which is basically ChatGPT for coders that finishes whatever line of code you’re working on or helps you debug some code that’s broken.
And there have been some studies and tests. I think there was one test that GitHub itself ran where they gave two groups of coders the same task, and one group was allowed to use GitHub Copilot and one group wasn’t. And the group with GitHub Copilot finished the task 55 percent faster than the group without it. Now, that is a radical productivity increase. And if you tell a programmer, here’s a tool that can make you 55 percent faster, they’re going to want to use that every day.
EZRA KLEIN: So when I see, functionally, chatbots in the wild, what I see is different versions of what people used to somewhat derisively call the fancy autocomplete, right? Help you finish this line of code, help you finish this email. You ask a question that you might ask the search engine, like why do I have spots all over my elbow? And it gives you an answer that hopefully is right but maybe is not right.
I do think some of the search implications are interesting. But at the same time, it is not the case that Bing has made great strides on Google. People have not moved to asking the kind of Bing chatbot its questions as opposed to asking Google. Everybody feels like they need A.I. in their thing now. There’s a — I don’t think you can raise money in Silicon Valley at the moment if you don’t have a generative A.I. play built into your product or built into your business strategy.
But that was true for a minute for crypto, too. And I’m not one of the people who makes a crypto A.I. analogy. I think crypto is largely vaporware and A.I. is largely real. But Silicon Valley is faddish and people don’t know how to use things and so everybody tries to put things in all at once. What product has actually gotten way better?
CASEY NEWTON: I’ll just use one example. There’s an app you might be familiar with called Notion. It’s productivity collaborative software. I write a newsletter. I save every link that I put in my newsletter into Notion. And now that there is A.I. inside Notion, Notion can do a couple of things. One, it can just look at every link I save and just write a two-sentence summary for me, which is just nice to see, at a glance, what that story is about.
And most recently it added a feature where you can just do Q&A with a database and say like, hey, what are some of the big stories about Meta over the past few weeks? And it’ll just start pulling those up, essentially querying the database that I have built. And so while we’re very early in this, you’re beginning to see a world where A.I. is taking data that you have stored somewhere and it’s turning it into your personal research assistant. So is it great right now? No, I would give it like a C. But for 1.0, I think it’s not bad.
KEVIN ROOSE: And I’ll share another example that is not from my own use, but I was talking a few weeks ago with a doctor who’s a friend of a friend. And doctors, you get tons of messages from patients. What’s this rash? Can you renew this prescription? Do I need to come in for a blood test, that kind of stuff. And doctors and nurses spend a ton of time just opening up their message portal, replying to all these messages. It’s a huge part of being a doctor and it’s a part that they don’t like.
And so this doctor was telling me that they have this software now that essentially uses a language model — I assume it’s OpenAI’s or someone very similar to that — that goes in and pre-fills the responses to patient queries. And the doctor still has to look it over, make sure everything’s right and press Send. But just that act of pre-populating the field, this person was saying it saves them a ton of time, like on the order of several hours a day.
And if you have that, and you extrapolate to what if every doctor in America was saving themselves an hour or two a day of responding to patient messages? I mean, that’s a radical productivity enhancement. And so you can say that that’s just fancy autocomplete, and I guess on some level it is. But just having fancy autocomplete in these paperwork-heavy professions could be very important.
EZRA KLEIN: Well, let me push that in two directions, because one direction is that I am not super thrilled about the idea that my doctor, theoretically here, is glancing over things and clicking “submit” as opposed to reading my message themselves and having to do the act of writing, which helps you think about things and thinking about what I actually emailed them and what kind of answer they need to give me. I mean, I know personally the difference in thought between scanning things and editing and thinking through things. So that’s my diminishing response.
But the flip of it is the thing I’m not hearing anybody say here, and the thing I keep waiting for and being interested in is the things A.I. might be able to do better than my doctor. I was reading Jack Clark’s “Import A.I.” newsletter today, which I super recommend to people who want to follow advancements in the field, and he was talking about a — I mean, it was a system being tested, not a system that is in deployment — but it was better at picking up pancreatic cancer from certain kinds of information than doctors are.
And I keep waiting to hear something like this going out into the field. Something that doesn’t just save people a bit of time around the edges. I agree that’s a productivity improvement. It’s fine. You can build a business around that. But the promise of A.I. when Sam Altman sat with you all a few weeks ago, or however long it was, and said, we’re moving to the best world ever, he didn’t mean that our paperwork is going to get a little bit easier to complete. He meant we’d have cures for new diseases. He meant that we would have new kinds of energy possibilities. I’m interested in the programs and the models that can create things that don’t exist.
CASEY NEWTON: Well, to get there, you need systems that can reason. And right now the systems that we have just aren’t very good at reasoning. I think that over the past year we have seen them move a little away from the way that I was thinking of them a year ago, which was a sort of fancy autocomplete. It’s making a prediction about what the next word will be. It’s still true that they do it that way. But it is able to create a kind of facsimile of thought that can be interesting in some ways.
But you just can’t get to where you’re going, Ezra, with a facsimile of thought. You need something that has improved reasoning capabilities. So maybe that comes with the next generation of frontier models. But until then, I think you’ll be disappointed.
EZRA KLEIN: But do you need a different kind of model? This is something that lingers in the back of my head. So I did an interview on the show with Demis Hassabis who’s the co-founder of DeepMind and now runs the integrated DeepMind Google A.I. program. And DeepMind had built this system a while back called AlphaFold, which treated how proteins are constructed in 3-D space, which is to say in reality. We live in 3-D space. [LAUGHS] It treated it as a game. And it fed itself a bunch of information and it became very good at predicting the structure of proteins. And that solved this really big scientific problem. And they then created a subsidiary of Alphabet called Isomorphic Labs to try to build drug discovery on similar foundations.
But my understanding is that Google, during this period, became terrified of Microsoft and OpenAI beating it up in search and Office. And so they pulled a lot of resources, not least Hassabis himself, into this integrated structure to try to win the chatbot wars, which is now what their system Bard is trying to do. And so when you said, Casey, that we need things that can reason, I mean maybe. But also, you could say we need things that are tailored to solve problems we care about more.
And I think this is one of the things that worries me a bit, that we’ve backed ourselves into business models that are not that important for humanity. Is there some chance of that? I mean, are we going too hard after language-based general intelligent A.I. that, by the way, integrates very nicely into a suite of enterprise software as opposed to building things that actually create scientific breakthroughs but don’t have the same kind of high scalability profit structure behind them?
CASEY NEWTON: I would stick up for the people who are working on the what you could call the non-language problems in A.I. right now. This stuff is going on. It maybe doesn’t get as much attention from people like the three of us as it should. But if you talk to folks in fields like pharmaceuticals and biotech, there are new A.I. biotech companies spinning up every day, getting funding to go after drug discovery or some more narrow application.
We talked to a researcher the other day, formerly of Google, who is teaching A.I. to smell. Taking the same techniques that go into these transformer-based neural networks like ChatGPT and applying them to the molecular structures of different chemicals, and using that to be able to predict what these things will smell like.
And you might say, well, what’s the big deal with that? And the answer is that some diseases have smells associated with them that we can’t pick up on because our noses aren’t as sensitive as, say, dogs or other animals. But if you could train an A.I. to be able to recognize scent molecules and predict odors from just chemical structures, that could actually be useful in all kinds of ways. So I think this kind of thing is happening. It’s just not dominating the coverage the way that ChatGPT is.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
EZRA KLEIN: Let me ask you, Kevin, about I think an interesting, maybe promising, maybe scary avenue for A.I. that you possibly personally foreclosed, which is, at some point during the year, Microsoft gave you access to a OpenAI-powered chatbot that had this dual personality of Sydney. And Sydney tried to convince you you didn’t love your wife and that you wanted to run away with Sydney. And my understanding is immediately after that happened, everybody with enough money to have a real business model an A.I. lobotomized the personalities of their A.I.s. That was the end of Sydney.
But there are a lot of startups out there trying to do A.I. friends, A.I. therapists, A.I. sex bots, A.I. boyfriends and girlfriends and nonbinary partners, just every kind of A.I. companion you can imagine. I’ve always thought this is a pretty obvious way this will affect society, and the Sydney thing convinced me that the technology for it already exists. So where is that, and how are those companies doing?
KEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, I mean, I’m sorry, A, if I did foreclose the possibility of A.I. personalities.
I think what’s happening is it’s just a little too controversial and fraught for any of the big companies to wade into. Microsoft doesn’t want its A.I. assistants and co-pilots to have strong personalities. That much is clear. And I don’t think their enterprise customers want them to have strong personalities, especially if those personalities are adversarial, or confrontational, or creepy, or unpredictable in some way. They want Clippy but with real brain power.
But there are companies that are going after this more social A.I. market. One of them is this company Character A.I., which was started by one of the original people at Google who made the transformer breakthrough. And that company is growing pretty rapidly. They’ve got a lot of users, especially young users, and they are doing, essentially, A.I. personas. You can make your own A.I. persona and chat with it or you can pick from ones that others have created.
Meta is also going a little bit in this direction. They have these persona-driven A.I. chatbots. And all of these companies have put guardrails around — no one really wants to do the erotic — what they call erotic role-play, in part because they don’t want to run afoul of things like the Apple app store terms of service.
But I expect that that will also be a big market for young people. And anecdotally, I mean I have just heard from a lot of young people who already say, like, my friends have A.I. chatbot friends that they talk to all the time. And it does seem to be making inroads into high schools. And that’s just an area that I’ll be fascinated to track.
CASEY NEWTON: I mean, this is going to be huge. A couple thoughts come to mind. One, I talked to somebody who works at one of the leading A.I. companies, and they told me that 99 percent of people whose accounts they remove, they remove for trying to get it to write text-based erotica. So that, I think, speaks to the market demand for this sort of thing.
I’ve also talked to people who have used the models of this that are not constrained by any safety guidelines, and I’ve been told these things are actually incredible at writing erotica. So what I’m telling you is there is a $10 billion —
EZRA KLEIN: So you’ve done really a lot of reporting on this, Casey. You’d say maybe a personal interest?
CASEY NEWTON: I’m so interested in this. Look, I write about content moderation, and porn is the content moderation frontier. And it’s just very interesting to me that it’s so clear that there are billions of dollars to be made here and no company will touch it.
And I asked one person involved, I said, well, why don’t you just let people do this? And they basically said, look, if you do this, you become a porn company overnight. It overwhelms the usage — this is what people wind up using your thing for and you’re working at a different company then. So I sort of get it.
But even setting aside the explicitly erotic stuff, Ezra, you well know and have talked and written about, just the loneliness epidemic that we have in this country. There’s a lot of isolated people in this world. And I think there is a very real possibility that a lot of those people will find comfort and joy and delight with talking to these A.I.-based companions.
I also think that when that happens, there will be a culture war over it. And we will see lengthy segments on Fox News about how the Silicon Valley technologists created a generation of shut-ins who wants to do nothing but talk to their fake friends on their phones. So I do think this is the culture war yet to come, and the question is just when do the enabling technologies get good enough and when do companies decide that they’re willing to deal with the blowback?
EZRA KLEIN: I also think this is going to be a generational thing. I mean, I’m very interested in this and have been for a bit, in part because I suspect, if I had to make a prediction here, my five-year-old is going to grow up with A.I. friends. And my pat line is that today we worry that 12-year-olds don’t see their friends enough in person. And tomorrow we’ll worry that not enough of our 12-year-old’s friends are persons. Because it’s going to become normal.
And my sense is that the systems are really good. If you unleashed them, you are already good enough to functionally master this particular application. And the big players simply haven’t unleashed them. I’ve heard from people at the big companies here who are like, oh, yeah, if we wanted to do this, we could dominate it.
But that does bring me to a question, which is Meta kind of does want to do this. Meta, which owns Facebook, which is a social media company. They seem to want to do it in terms of these lame-seeming celebrity avatars. You can talk to A.I. Snoop Dogg.
CASEY NEWTON: It’s so bad.
EZRA KLEIN: But Meta is interesting to me because their A.I. division is run by Yann LeCun, who’s one of the most important A.I. researchers in the field, and they seem to have very different cultural dynamics in their A.I. shop than Google DeepMind or OpenAI. Tell me a bit about Meta’s strategy here and what makes them culturally different.
KEVIN ROOSE: Well, Casey, you cover Meta and have for a long time and may have some insight here. My sense is that they are up against a couple problems, one of which is they have arrived to A.I. late and to generative A.I. specifically. Facebook was, for many years, considered one of the top two labs along with Google when it came to recruiting A.I. talent, to putting out cutting edge research, to presenting papers at the big A.I. conferences. They were one of the big dogs.
And then they had this funny thing happen where they released a model called Galactica just right before ChatGPT was released last year. And it was supposed to be this L.L.M. for science and for research papers. And it was out for I think three days. And people started noticing that it was making up fake citations.
It was hallucinating. It was doing what all the A.I. models do. But it was from Meta and so it felt different. It had this tarnish on it because people already worried about fake news on Facebook. And so it got pulled down. And then ChatGPT, just shortly thereafter, launched and became this global sensation.
So they’re grappling for what to do with this technology that they’ve built now. There’s not a real obvious business case for shoving A.I. chatbots into products like Facebook and Instagram. And they don’t sell enterprise software like Microsoft does, so they can’t really shove it into paid subscription products. So my sense from talking with folks over there is that they’re just not sure what to do with this technology that they’ve built. And so they’re just flinging it open to the masses. What do you think?
CASEY NEWTON: That tracks with me. I basically don’t get it either. Basically what you’ve just said has been explained to me. They are investing a ton with no obvious return on investment in the near term future. I will say that these celebrity A.I. chatbots they’ve made are quite bad.
EZRA KLEIN: Horrible.
CASEY NEWTON: It’s truly baffling. And the thing is they’ve taken celebrities, but the celebrities are not playing themselves in the A.I. They’ve given all of the celebrities silly names. And you can just follow their Instagram and send them messages and say, hey, character that Snoop Dogg is portraying, like what do you think about this? So it’s all very silly. And I expect it’ll die a rapid death sometime in the next year and then we’ll see if they have a better idea.
What I will say is if you’re somebody who wakes up from A.I. nightmares some mornings, as a lot of folks in San Francisco do, go listen to Yann LeCun talk about it. No one has ever been more relaxed about A.I. than Yann LeCun. It’s just like an army of superhuman assistants are about to live inside your computer. They’re going to do anything you want to do and there’s no risk of them harming you ever. So if you’re feeling anxious, go listen to Yann.
EZRA KLEIN: Do you think he’s right? Because it also has led to a policy difference. Meta has been much more open source in their approach, which OpenAI and Google seem to think is irresponsible. But there is something happening there that I think is also built around a different view of safety. What is their view of safety? Why does Yann LeCun, who is an important figure in this whole world, why is he so much more chill than, you know, name your other founder?
CASEY NEWTON: I mean, part of it is I just think these are deeply held convictions from someone who is an expert on this space and who has been a pioneer and who understands the technology certainly far better than I do. And he can just not see from here to killer robot. So I respect his viewpoint in that respect given his credentials in the space.
I think on the question of is open source A.I. safer, this is still an open question — not to pun. The argument for it being safer is, well, if it’s open source, that means that average people can go in and look at the code, and identify flaws, and see how the machine works, and they can point those out in public, and then they can be fixed in public.
Whereas if you have something like OpenAI, which is building very powerful systems behind closed doors, we don’t have the same kind of access. And so you might not need to rely on a government regulator to see how safe their systems were. So that is the argument in favor of open source.
Of course, the flip side of that is like, well, if you take a very powerful open source model and you put it out on the open web, even if it’s true that anyone can poke holes and identify flaws, it’s also true that a bad actor could take that model and then use it to do something really, really bad. So that hasn’t happened yet, but it certainly seems like it’s an obvious possibility at some time in the near future.
EZRA KLEIN: Let me use that as a bridge to safety more generally. So we’ve talked a bit about where these systems have gone over the past year, where they seem to be going. But there’s been a lot of concern that they are unsafe and fundamentally that they’ve become misaligned or that we don’t understand them or what they’re doing. What kind of breakthroughs have there been with all this investment and all this attention on safety, Kevin?
KEVIN ROOSE: So a lot of work has gone into what is called fine-tuning of these models. So basically if you’re making a large language model, like GPT-4, you have several phases of that. Phase one is what’s called pre-training, which is just the basic process. You take all of this data. You shove it into this neural network and it learns to make predictions about the next word in a sequence.
Then from there, you do what’s called fine-tuning. And that is basically where you are trying to turn the model into something that’s actually useful or tailored. Turn it into a chatbot. Turn it into a tool for doctors. Turn it into something for social A.I.s. That’s the process that includes things like reinforcement learning from human feedback, which is how a lot of the leading models are fine-tuned. And that work has continued to progress. The models, they say, today are safer and less likely to generate harmful outputs than previous generations of models.
There’s also this field of interpretability, which is where I’ve been doing a lot of reporting over the past few months, which is this tiny subfield of A.I. that is trying to figure out what the guts of a language model look like and what is actually happening inside one of these models when you ask it a question or give it some prompt and it produces an output.
And this is a huge deal, not only because I think people want to know how these things work — they’re not satisfied by just saying these are mystical black boxes — but also because if you understand what’s going on inside a model, then you can understand if, for example, the model starts lying to you or starts becoming deceptive, which is a thing that A.I. safety researchers worry about. So that process of interpretability research I think is really important. There have been a few minor breakthroughs in that field over the past year, but it is still slow going and it’s still a very hard problem to crack.
CASEY NEWTON: And I think it’s worth just pausing to underscore what Kevin said, which is the people building these systems do not know how they work. They know at a high level, but there is a lot within that where if you show them an individual output from the A.I., they will not be able to tell you exactly why it said what it said. Also, if you run the same query multiple times, you’ll get slightly different answers. Why is that? Again, the researchers can’t tell you.
So as we have these endless debates over A.I. safety, one reason why I do tend to lean on the side of the folks who are scared is this exact point. At the end of the day, we still don’t know how the systems work.
EZRA KLEIN: Tell me if this tracks for you. I think compared to a year ago, when I talked to the A.I. safety people, the people who worry about A.I.s that become misaligned and do terrible civilizational-level damage, A.I.s that could be really badly misused, they seem to think it has been actually a pretty good year, most of them.
They think they’ve been able to keep big models, like GPT-4, which, of course, are much less powerful than what they one day expect to invent, but they think they’ve been pretty good at keeping them aligned. They have made some progress on interpretability, which wasn’t totally clear a year ago. Many people said that was potentially not a problem we could solve. At least we’re making some breakthroughs there.
They’re not relaxed — the people who worry about this. And they will often say we would need a long time to fully understand even the things we have now and we may not have that long. But nevertheless, I get the sense that the safety people seem a little more confident that the technical work they’ve been doing is paying off than at least was the impression I got from the reporting prior.
CASEY NEWTON: I think that’s right. I mean, Sam Altman, in particular, this has been his strategy, is we are going to release this stuff that is in our labs and we’re going to wait and see how society reacts to it. And then we’ll give it some time to let society address and then we will release the next thing. That’s what he thinks is the best way to slowly integrate A.I. into our lives.
And if you’d asked me maybe 11 months ago, like a month into using ChatGPT, what are the odds of something really, really bad happening because of the availability of ChatGPT, I would have put them much higher than they turned out to be. And when you talk to folks at OpenAI, they will tell you that that company really has taken A.I. safety really seriously. You can see this yourself when you use the product. Ask it a question about sex, it basically calls the police. So there is a lot to be said for how these systems have been built so far.
KEVIN ROOSE: And I would say the other thing that I’ve heard from A.I. safety researchers is that they are feeling relief not just that the world has not ended but that more people are now worried about A.I. It was a very lonely thing for many years to be someone who worried about A.I. safety because there was no apparent reason to be worried about A.I. safety, right? The chatbots that were out, it was like Siri and Alexa and they were terrible. And no one could imagine that these things could become dangerous or harmful because the technology itself was just not that advanced.
Now you have congressional hearings. You have regulations coming from multiple countries. You have people like Geoff Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, two of the so-called godfathers of deep learning, proclaiming that they are worried about where this technology is headed. So I think for the people who’ve been working on this stuff for a long time, there is some just palpable relief at like, oh, I don’t have to carry this all on my shoulders anymore. The world is now aware of these systems and what risks they could pose.
EZRA KLEIN: One irony of it is that my read from talking to people is that A.I. safety is going better as a technical matter than was expected and I think worse as a matter of governance and intercorporate competition and regulatory arbitrage than they had hoped.
There is a fear, as I understand it, that we could make the technical breakthroughs needed, but that the kind of coordination necessary to go slow enough to make them, that’s where a lot of the fear is. I think they feel like that’s actually going worse, not better.
CASEY NEWTON: So one of the big narratives coming out of Sam Altman’s firing was that it must have had something to do with A.I. safety. And based on my reporting and reporting shared by many others, this was not an A.I. safety issue. But it is very much the story that is being discussed about the whole affair.
And the folks who are on the board who are associated with these A.I. safety ideas, they’ve taken a huge hit to their public reputation because of the way they handled the firing and all of that. And so I think a really bad outcome of this firing is that the A.I. safety community loses its credibility, even though A.I. safety, as far as we can tell, really didn’t have a lot to do with what happened to Sam Altman.
EZRA KLEIN: Yeah, I first agree that clearly A.I. safety was not behind whatever disagreements Altman and the board had. I heard that from both sides of this. And I didn’t believe it, and I didn’t believe it, and I finally was convinced of it. I was like, you guys had to have had some disagreement here? It seems so fundamental.
But this is what I mean the governance is going worse. All the OpenAI people thought it was very important, and Sam Altman himself talked about its importance all the time, that they had this nonprofit board connected to this nonfinancial mission. The values of building A.I. that served humanity, that could fire Sam Altman at any time or even shut down the company fundamentally if they thought it was going awry in some way or another.
And the moment that board tried to do that — now, I think they did not try to do that on very strong grounds — but the moment they tried to do that, it turned out they couldn’t. That the company could fundamentally reconstitute itself at Microsoft or that the board itself couldn’t withstand the pressure coming back.
I think the argument from the board side, the now mostly defunct board, is that this didn’t go as badly for them as the press is reporting. That they brought in some other board members who are not cronies of Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Sam Altman and Greg Brockman are not on the board now. There’s going to be investigation into Altman. So maybe they have a stronger board that is better able to stand up to Altman. That is one argument I have heard.
On the other hand, those stronger board members do not hold the views on A.I. safety that the board members who left, like Helen Toner of Georgetown and Tasha McCauley from Rand, held. I mean, these are people who are going to be very interested in whether or not OpenAI is making money. I’m not saying they don’t care about other things too, but these are people who know how to run companies. They serve on corporate boards in a normal way where the output of the corporate board is supposed to be shareholder value, and that’s going to influence them even if they understand themselves to have a different mission here. I mean, am I getting that story wrong to you?
KEVIN ROOSE: No, I think that’s right. And it speaks to one of the most interesting and strangest things about this whole industry is that the people who started these companies were weird. And I say that with no normative judgment. But they made very weird decisions.
They thought A.I. was exciting and amazing. They wanted to build A.G.I. But they were also terrified of it, to the point that they developed these elaborate safeguards. I mean, in OpenAI’s case, they put this nonprofit board in charge of the for-profit subsidiary and gave, essentially, the nonprofit board the power to push a button and shut down the whole thing if they wanted to.
At Anthropic, one of these other A.I. companies, they are structured as a public benefit corporation. And they have their own version of a nonprofit board that is capable of essentially pushing the big red shut it all down button if things get too crazy. This is not how Silicon Valley typically structures itself.
Mark Zuckerberg was not in his Harvard dorm room building Facebook thinking if this thing becomes the most powerful communication platform in the history of technology, I will need to put in place these checks and balances to keep myself from becoming too powerful. But that was the kind of thing that the people who started OpenAI and Anthropic were thinking about.
And so I think what we’re seeing is that that kind of structure is bowing to the requirements of shareholder capitalism which says that if you do need all this money to run these companies, to train these models, you are going to have to make some concessions to the powers of the shareholder and of the money. And so I think that one of the big pieces of fallout from this OpenAI drama is just that OpenAI is going to be structured and run much more like a traditional tech company than this kind of holdover from this nonprofit board.
CASEY NEWTON: And that is just a sad story. I truly wish that it had not worked out that way. I think one of the reasons why these companies were built in this way was because it just helped them attract better talent. I think that so many people working in A.I. are idealistic and civic-minded and do not want to create harmful things. And they’re also really optimistic about the power that good technology has.
And so when those people say that as powerful and good as these things could be, it could also be really dangerous, I take them really seriously. And I want them to be empowered. I want them to be on company boards. And those folks have just lost so much ground over the past couple of weeks. And it is a truly tragic development, I think, in the development of this industry.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
EZRA KLEIN: One thing you could just say with that is, yeah, it was always going to be up to governments here, not up to strange nonprofit, corporate, semi-corporate structures. And so we actually have seen a huge amount of government activity in recent weeks.
And so I want to start here in the US. Biden announced a big package of a big executive order. You could call them regulations. I would call them pre-regulations. But Casey, how would you describe in sum what they did. What is the Biden administration’s approach that it is signaling to regulating A.I.?
CASEY NEWTON: The big headline was if you are going to train a new model, so a successor to a GPT-4, and it uses a certain amount of energy — and the energy there is just a proxy for how powerful and capable this model might be — you have to tell the federal government that you have done this, and you have to inform them what safety testing you did on this model before releasing it to the public.
So that is the one break that they attempted to put on the development of this industry. It does not say you can’t train these models. It doesn’t specify what safety tests you have to do. It just says if you are going to go down this road, you have to be in touch with us. And that will, I think, slightly decelerate the development of these models.
I think critics would say it also pushes us a little bit away from a more open source version of A.I. That open source development is chaotic by its nature, and if you want to do some giant open source project that would compete with the GPTs of the world, that would just be harder to do. But to me those were the big takeaways.
EZRA KLEIN: One of the things that struck me looking at the order was go back a year, go back two years, I think the thing that people would have said is that the government doesn’t understand this at all. It can barely be conversant in technology. People remember Senator Orrin Hatch asking Mark Zuckerberg, well, if you’re not making people pay, then how do you make money?
When I read the order and looked at it, this actually struck me as pretty seriously engaged. For instance, there’s a big debate in the A.I. world about whether or not you’re going to regulate based on the complexity and power of the model or the use of the model. You have a fear about what happens if you’re using the model for medical decisions. But if you’re just using it as your personal assistant, who cares?
Whereas, the A.I. safety people have the view that, no, no, no, the personal assistant model might actually be the really dangerous one because that’s the one that knows how to act in the real world. And the Biden administration takes a real — it actually takes a view of the A.I. safety people. If you have a model over a certain level of computing complexity, they want this higher level of scrutiny, higher level of disclosure on it. They want everything that comes from an A.I. to be watermarked in some way so you can see that it is A.I.-generated.
This struck me as the Biden administration actually clearly having taken this seriously and having convened some set of group of stakeholders and experts that knew what they were doing.
I mean, I don’t necessarily agree with literally every decision and a lot of it is just asking for reports. But when you think about it as a framework for regulation, it didn’t read to me as a framework coming from people who had not thought about this for 10 minutes.
CASEY NEWTON: Absolutely. I was quite impressed. I had a chance to meet with Ben Buchanan at the White House who worked on this, talked to him about this stuff. And it is clear that they have been reading everything. They’ve been talking to as many people as they can. And they did arrive in a really nuanced place.
And I think when you look at the reaction from the A.I. developers in general, it was mostly neutral to lightly positive, right? There was not a lot of blowback. But at the same time, folks in civic society I think were also excited that the government did have a point of view here and had done its own work.
KEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, it struck me as a very deft set of — I think I would agree that they’re more like pre-regulations than regulations. And to me it sounded like what the Biden White House was trying to do was throw a few bones to everyone.
We’re going to throw a few bones to the A.I. safety community who worries about foundation models becoming too powerful. We’re going to throw some bones to the A.I. harms community that is worried about things like bias and inaccuracy. And we’re going to throw some bones to the people who worry about foreign use of A.I. So I saw it as a very deliberate attempt to give every camp in this debate a little to feel happy about.
EZRA KLEIN: One of the things it raised for me as a question, though, was did it point to a world where you think that regulators are going to be empowered to actually act? This was the thing I was thinking about after the board collapse. You imagine a world sometime in the future where you have OpenAI with GPT 6 or Meta or whomever, and they are releasing something that the regulator is looking at the safety data, looking at what’s there.
They’re just itchy about it. It’s not obviously going to do a ton of harm, but they’re not convinced it’s safe. They’ve seen some things that worry them. Are they really going to have the power to say, no, we don’t think your safety testing was good enough, when this is a powerful company, when they won’t be able to release a lot of the proprietary data, right?
The thing where the board could not really explain why they were firing Sam Altman struck me as almost going to be the situation of virtually every regulator trying to think about the future harms of a model. If you’re regulating in time to stop the thing from doing harm, it’s going to be a judgment call. And if it’s a judgment call, it’s going to be a very hard one to make. And so if we ever got to the point where somebody needed to flip the switch and say no, does anybody actually have the credibility to do it?
Or is what we’ve seen, that, in fact, these very lauded, successful companies run by smart people who have huge Twitter followings or Threads followings or whatever they end up being on, that they actually have so much public power that they’ll always be able to make the case for themselves. And the political economy of this is actually that we better just hope the A.I. companies get it right because nobody’s really going to have the capability to stand in front of them.
CASEY NEWTON: When you talk to folks who are really worried about A.I. safety, they think that there is a high possibility that at some point, in let’s say the next five years, A.I. triggers some sort of event that kills multiple thousands of people. What that event could be, we could speculate. But assume that that is true, I think that changes the political debate a lot. All of a sudden you start to see jets get scrambled. Hopefully that never happens, but I think that will be the inciting moment.
And this is the thing that just frustrates me as somebody who writes about tech policy is we just live in a country that doesn’t pass laws. There are endless hearings, endless debates. And then it gets time to regulate something and it’s like, well, yeah, they can regulate A.I., but it’s going to be based on this one regulation that was passed to deal with the oat farming crisis of 1906 and we’re just going to hope that it applies.
And it’s like, we should pass new laws in this country. I don’t know that there’s a law that needs to be passed today to ensure that all of this goes well, but certainly Congress is going to need to do something at some point as this stuff evolves.
KEVIN ROOSE: I mean, one thing I was thinking about as this whole situation at OpenAI was playing out was actually the financial crisis in 2008 and the scenes that were captured in books and movies where you have the heads of all the investment banks and they’re scrambling to avoid going under.
And they’re meeting in these boardrooms with people like Ben Bernanke, the Chair of the Federal Reserve. And the government actually had a critical role there in patching together the financial system because they were interested, not in which banks survived and which failed, but in making sure that there was a banking system when the markets opened the next Monday.
And so I think we just need a new regulatory framework that does have some kind of — the clichéd word would be stakeholder. But someone who is in there as a representative of the government who is saying, what is the resolution to this conflict that makes sense for most Americans or most people around the world?
EZRA KLEIN: When you looked at who the government gave power to in this document, when you think about who might play a role like that, when you need to call the government on A.I., the way I read it is it spread power out across a lot of different agencies. And there were places where it invested more rather than less.
But one thing that different people have called for that I didn’t see it do, in part because you would actually need to pass a law to do this, was actually create the A.I. Department, something that is funded and structured and built to do this exact thing, to be the central clearinghouse inside the government, to be led by somebody who would be the most credible on these issues and would maybe have then the size and strength to do this kind of research.
The thing that is in my head here, because I find your analogy really compelling, Kevin, is the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is a big institution. And it has a significant power of its own in terms of setting interest rates. It also does a huge amount of research. When you think about where would a public option for A.I. come from, you would need something like that that has the money to be doing its own research and hiring really excellent people. In that case, economists. In this case, A.I. researchers.
And there was nothing like that here. It was an assertion that we more or less have the structure we need. We more or less have the laws we need. We can apply all those things creatively. But it did not say this is such a big deal that we need a new institution to be our point person on it.
KEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, I mean, I think that’s correct. I think there are some reasons for that. But I think you do want a government that has its own technological capacity when it comes to A.I. Previous waves of innovation, certainly nuclear power during the Manhattan Project, but also things like the internet came out of Darpa. These are areas where the government did have significant technical expertise and was building its own technology in competition with the private sector.
There is no public sector equivalent of ChatGPT. The government has not built anything even remotely close to that. And I think it’s worth asking why that is and what would need to happen for the government to have its own capacity, not just to evaluate and regulate these systems, but to actually build some of their own.
EZRA KLEIN: I think it is genuinely strange, on some level, that given how important this is, there is not a bill gathering steam. Look, if the private sector thinks it is worth pumping $50 or $100 billion into these companies so they can help you make better enterprise software, it seems weird to imagine that there are not public problems that have an economic value that is equal to that or significantly larger.
And we may just not want to pay that money. Fine. But we do that for infrastructure, right? I mean, we just passed a gigantic infrastructure bill. And if we thought of A.I. like infrastructure — we actually also spend a lot of money on broadband now — it seems to me you’d want to think about it that way.
And I think it is a kind of fecklessness and cowardice on the part of the political culture that it no longer thinks itself capable of doing things like that. At the very least — and I’ve said this I think on your show probably — I think they should have prize systems where they say a bunch of things they want to see solved, and if you can build an A.I. system that will solve them, they’ll give you $1 billion.
But the one thing is the government does not like to do things and spend money for an uncertain return. And building a giant A.I. system is spending a lot of money for an uncertain return. And so the only part of the government that’s probably doing something like it is the Defense Department in areas that we don’t know. And that does not make me feel better. That makes me feel worse. [LAUGHS] That’s my take on that.
KEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, I mean, I think there’s also a piece of this that has to do with labor and talent. There are probably on the order of several thousand people in the world who can oversee the building, training, fine-tuning, deployment of large language models. It is a very specific skill set. And the people who have it can make gobs of money in the private sector working wherever they want to.
The numbers that you hear coming out of places like OpenAI for what engineers are being paid there — I mean, it’s like NFL-level football compensation packages for some of their people. And the government simply can’t or won’t pay that much money to someone to do equivalent work for the public sector. Now, I’m not saying they should be paying engineers millions of dollars of taxpayer money to build these things, but that’s what you would need to do if you wanted to compete in an open market for the top A.I. talent.
EZRA KLEIN: I am saying they should. I am saying this is the fecklessness and cowardice point. This is stupid.
KEVIN ROOSE: You think there should be A.I. engineers working for the federal government making $5 million a year?
EZRA KLEIN: Look, maybe not $5 million a year. But it would — this thing that we don’t think civil servants should make as much as people in the private sector because — I don’t know — somebody at a congressional hearing is going to stand and be like, that person is making a lot of money, that is a way we rob the public of value.
If Google’s not wrong, Microsoft is not wrong that you can create things that are of social value through A.I., and if you believe that, then leaving it to them — I mean, they intend to make a profit. Why shouldn’t the public get great gains from this? It won’t necessarily be through profit. But if we could cure different diseases or make big advances on energy — this way of thinking is actually to me the really significant problem.
I’m not sure you would need to pay people as much as you’re saying because I actually do think a lot of — I mean, we both know the culture of the A.I. people. And at least up until a year or so ago, it was weird. And a lot of them would do weird things and are not living very lush lives. They’re in group houses with each other, taking psychedelics, and working on A.I. on the weekdays. But I think you could get people in to do important work and you should.
Now, look, you don’t have the votes to do stuff like this. I think that’s the real answer. But in other countries, they will and do. When Saudi Arabia decides that it needs an A.I. to be geostrategically competitive, it will take the money it makes from selling oil to the world, and in the same way that it’s currently using that money to hire sports stars, it will hire A.I. engineers for a bazillion dollars. And it will get some of them and then it will have a decent A.I. system one day. I don’t know why we’re waiting on other people to do that. We’re rich. It’s stupid.
CASEY NEWTON: I agree with you, Ezra. And I’m sorry that Kevin is so resistant to your ideas because I think paying public servants well would do a lot of good for this country.
KEVIN ROOSE: Look, I think public servants should be paid well.
I’m just saying when Jim Jordan gets up and grills the former DeepMind engineer about why the Labor Department is paying them $2.6 million to fine-tune language models, I’m not sure what the answer is going to be.
EZRA KLEIN: No, I agree with you. I mean — but I think we’re all saying, in a way, the same thing. This is a problem. Government by dumb things Jim Jordan says is not going to be a great government that takes advantage of opportunities for the public good. And that sucks. It would be better if we were doing this differently and if we thought about it differently.
Let me ask about China. Because China is where, on the one hand, at least on paper, the regulations look much tougher. So one version is maybe they’re regulating A.I. much more strictly than we are. Another view that I’ve heard is that, in fact, that’s true for companies, but the Chinese government is making sure that it’s building very, very strong A.I.s. To the extent you all have looked at it, how do you understand the Chinese regulatory approach and how it differs from our own?
CASEY NEWTON: I mean, I’ve looked at it mostly from the standpoint of what are the consumer-facing systems look like. It has only been I think a couple of months since China approved the first consumer usable ChatGPT equivalent. As you might imagine, they have very strict requirements as far as what the chatbot can say about Tiananmen Square. So they wind up being more limited maybe than what you can use in the United States. As far as what is happening behind closed doors, and for their defense systems and that sort of thing, I’m in the dark.
KEVIN ROOSE: So four or five years ago, when I started reporting a book about A.I., the conventional wisdom among A.I. researchers was that China was ahead and they were going to make all of the big breakthroughs and beat the U.S. technology companies when it came to A.I.
So it’s been very surprising to me that in the past year since ChatGPT has come out, we have not seen anything even remotely close to that level of performance coming out of a Chinese company. Now, I do think they are working on this stuff. But it’s been surprising to me that China has been mostly absent from the frontier A.I. conversation over the past year.
EZRA KLEIN: And do you think those things are related? Do you think that the Chinese government’s risk aversion and the underperformance of at least the products and systems we’ve seen in China — I mean, there might be things we don’t know about — do you think those things are connected?
KEVIN ROOSE: Absolutely. I think you do need a risk appetite to be able to build and govern these systems because they are unpredictable. We don’t know exactly how they work. And what we saw, for example, with Microsoft was that they put out this Bing Sydney chatbot and it got a lot of attention and blowback. And people reported all these crazy experiences. And in China, if something like that had happened, they might have shut the company down. Or it might have been deemed such an embarrassment that they would have radically scaled back the model.
And instead what Microsoft did was just say, we’re going to make some changes to try to prevent that kind of thing from happening, but we’re keeping this model out there. We’re going to let the public use it. And they’ll probably discover other crazy things, and that’s just part of the learning process. That’s something that I’ve been convinced of over the past year talking with A.I. executives and people at these companies is that you really do need some contact with the public before you start learning everything that these models are capable of and all the ways that they might misbehave.
EZRA KLEIN: What is the European Union trying to do? They’ve had draft regulations that seemed very expansive. What has been the difference in how they’re trying to regulate this versus how we are? And what in your understanding is the status of their effort?
CASEY NEWTON: Europe was quite ahead with developing its A.I. Act, but it was written in a pre-ChatGPT world. It was written in a pre-generative A.I. world. And so over the past year, they’ve been trying to retrofit it so that it kind of reflects our new reality and is caught up in debate in the meantime.
But my understanding is the A.I. Act is not particularly restrictive on what these companies can do. So to my understanding, there’s nothing in the A.I. Act that is going to prevent these next generation technologies from being built. It’s more about companies being transparent.
KEVIN ROOSE: Let me add a little bit of flavor to that because I was in Europe just recently talking with some lawmakers. And one of the things that people will say about the A.I. Act is that it has this risk-based framework where different A.I. products are evaluated and regulated based on these classifications of, this is a low-risk system, or this is a high-risk system, or this is a medium-risk system. So different rules apply based on which of those buckets a new tool falls into.
And so right now what a lot of regulators and politicians and companies and lobbyists in Europe are arguing about is what level of risk should something like a foundation model, a GPT-4, a Bard, a Claude — are those low-risk systems because they’re just chatbots or are they high-risk systems because you can build so many other things once you have that basic technology? And so that’s what my understanding is of the current battle in Europe is over whether foundation models, frontier models, whatever you want to call them, whether those should be assigned to one risk bucket or another.
EZRA KLEIN: I think that’s a good survey of the waterfront. And so I guess I’ll end on this question, which is, all right, we’re talking here at the one-year anniversary, roughly, of ChatGPT. If you were to guess, if we were having another conversation a year from now on the two-year anniversary, what do you think would have changed? What are one or two things each of you think is likely to happen over the next year that did not happen this year?
KEVIN ROOSE: I think all communication-based work will start to have an element of A.I. in it. All email, all presentations, office work, essentially, A.I. will be built into all the applications that we use for that stuff. And so it’ll just be part of the background just like autocomplete is today when you’re typing something on your phone.
CASEY NEWTON: I would say that A.I. is going to continue to hollow out the media industry. I think you’re going to see more publishers turning to these really bad services that just automate the generation of copy. You’ll see more content farms springing up on the web. It’ll reduce publisher revenue and we’ll just see more digital media businesses either get sold or quietly go out of business.
And that’s just going to go hand-in-hand with the decline of the web in general. A year from now, more and more people are going to be using ChatGPT and other tools as their front door to internet knowledge. And that’s just going to sap a lot of life out of the web as we know it. So we don’t need one more technological breakthrough for any of that to happen. That’s just a case of consumer preferences taking a while to change. And I think it’s well underway.
EZRA KLEIN: So do you think, then, that next year, we’re going to see something that has been long predicted, which is significant A.I.-related job losses? Is that the argument you’re making here?
CASEY NEWTON: I think that to some degree it already happened this year in digital media. And yes, I do think it will start to pick up. Just keep in mind, 12 months is not a lot of time for every single industry to ask itself, could I get away with 5 percent or 10 percent or 15 percent fewer employees? And as the end of this year comes around, I have to believe that in lots and lots of industries, people are going to be asking that question.
KEVIN ROOSE: Yeah, I agree. I don’t know whether there will be one year where all the jobs that are going to vanish vanish. I think it’s more likely to be a slow trickle over time. And it’s less likely to be mass layoffs than just new entrants that can do the same work as incumbents with many fewer people. The software development firm that only needs five coders because all their coders are using A.I. and they have software that is building itself, competing with companies that have 10,000 engineers and doing so much more capably.
So I don’t think it’s going to necessarily look like all the layoffs hit on one day, or in one quarter, or even in one year. But I do think we’re already seeing displacement of jobs through A.I.
EZRA KLEIN: Those are kind of dark predictions. I mean, we’ll have a little bit better integration of A.I. into office tools and also we’ll begin to see really the productivity improvements create job losses. Is there anything that you think is coming down the pike technologically that would be really deeply to the good, things that are not too far from fruition that you think will make life a lot better for people?
CASEY NEWTON: I mean, I love the idea of universal translators. It’s already pretty good using A.I. to speak in one language and get output in another. But I do think that’s going to enable a lot of cross-cultural communications. And there are a lot of products remaining to be built that will essentially just drop the latency so that you can talk and hear in real time and have it be quite good. So that’s something that makes me happy.
KEVIN ROOSE: And I’m hopeful that we will use A.I. — not we as in me and Casey and —
CASEY NEWTON: But we might. [LAUGHS]
KEVIN ROOSE: This would be sort of a career change for us. But we, as in society, I have some hope that we will use A.I. to cure one of the top deadliest diseases — cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, things like that that really affect massive numbers of people.
I don’t have any inside reporting that we are on the cusp of a breakthrough, but I know that a lot of energy and research and funding is going into using A.I. to discover new drugs and therapies for some of the leading killer diseases and conditions in the world. And so when I want to feel more optimistic, I just think about the possibility that all of that bears fruit sometime in the next few years. And that’s pretty exciting.
EZRA KLEIN: All right, and then always our final question. What are a few books you would each recommend to the audience or at least recommend the audience ask ChatGPT to summarize for them?
CASEY NEWTON: Kevin, you want to go first?
KEVIN ROOSE: Sure. I actually have two books and a YouTube video. The two books, one of them is called “Electrifying America” by David E. Nye. It is a 30-year-old history book about the process by which America got electricity. And it has been very interesting to read. I read it first a few years ago and have been rereading it just to sketch out what would it look like if A.I. really is the new electricity? What happened the last time society was transformed by a technology like this?
The other book I’ll recommend is “Your Face Belongs to Us” by my colleague — our colleague at “The Times,” Kashmir Hill, which is about the facial recognition A.I. company Clearview AI. and is one of the most compelling tech books I’ve read in a few years.
And then the YouTube video I’ll recommend was just posted a few days ago. It’s called “Intro to Large Language Models.” It’s made by Andre Karpathy who is an A.I. researcher actually at OpenAI. And it’s his one-hour introduction to what is a large language model and how does it work. And I’ve just found it very helpful for my own understanding.
EZRA KLEIN: Casey?
CASEY NEWTON: Well, Ezra, with permission, and given that Kevin has just given your listeners two great books and a YouTube video to read, I would actually like to recommend three newsletters, if I could. And the reason is because the books that were published this year did not help me really understand the future of the A.I. industry. And to understand what’s happening in real time, I really am leaning on newsletters more than I’m leaning on books. So is that OK?
EZRA KLEIN: Yeah, go for it.
CASEY NEWTON: All right. So the first one, cruelly, you already mentioned earlier in this podcast. It’s Import AI from Jack Clark. Jack co-founded Anthropic, one of the big A.I. developers. And it is fascinating to know which papers he’s reading every week that are helping him understand this world. And I think that they’re arguably having an effect on how Anthropic is being created because he is sitting in all of those rooms. So that is just an incredible weekly read.
I would also recommend AI Snake Oil from the Princeton Professor Arvind Narayanan and a Ph.D. student at Princeton, Sayash Kapoor. They’re very skeptical of A.I. hype and doomsday scenarios, but they also take the technology really seriously and have a lot of smart thoughts about policy and regulation.
And then the final one is Pragmatic Engineer by this guy Gergely Orosz. He’s this former Uber engineering manager. And he writes about a lot of companies, but he writes about them as workplaces. And I love when he writes about OpenAI as a workplace. He interviews people there about culture and management and process. And he just constantly reminds you they are just human beings, showing up to the office every day and building this stuff. And it’s just a really unique viewpoint on that world.
So read those three newsletters. You’ll have a little better sense of what’s coming for us in the future.
KEVIN ROOSE: What Casey didn’t say is that he actually hasn’t read a book in 10 years.
So it was a bit of a trick question.
CASEY NEWTON: [LAUGHS] You know what I will say? I did read “Your Face Belongs to Us” by Kash. An incredible book. Definitely read that one.
KEVIN ROOSE: Sure you did.
EZRA KLEIN: There you go. Casey Newton, Kevin Roose, your podcast, which requires very little reading, is “Hard Fork.”
Thank you all for being on the show.
KEVIN ROOSE: It’s the first illiterate podcast, actually, put out by “The New York Times.” Thank you for having us.
CASEY NEWTON: Thanks, Ezra.
EZRA KLEIN: Thanks, guys.

2023-12-02,"One day this summer, the internet personality Adin Ross switched on his camera and started broadcasting himself live to thousands of fans, sipping a Yerba Mate drink and nodding along to Lil Uzi.
Mr. Ross soon cut the music and started talking, assuring his fans that he would livestream Jake Paul’s upcoming boxing match, even though it would violate copyright laws. “I’ll pay the fines,” he promised them. Later, he streamed himself playing online slot machines and blackjack on a gambling site, Stake. Once, he streamed pornography. He has hosted Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist, and Andrew Tate, the online influencer known for his misogyny who faces human-trafficking charges. As Mr. Ross streams, his viewers post a torrent of messages in his channel’s chat feature — some celebrating him, some abusing him with slurs.
Welcome to life on Kick, the Wild West of livestreaming — where seemingly any kind of content goes. Since it went live late last year, the upstart platform has made waves in the world of livestreaming, long dominated by Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. Today, Kick has 21 million accounts, nearly twice as many as just four months ago, and has carved out a niche for itself as the latest home for the fringes of young male viewers who spend a significant amount of time online.
Kick, an Australian company, has flourished thanks to an unusual business model. It offers eyebrow-raising multimillion dollar contracts to top streamers and takes just 5 percent of all streamers’ earnings, compared with a 50-50 split on Twitch, helping lure away both top Twitch stars and rank-and-file content creators who say they’ve seen a bump in earnings. But the site itself is something of a loss leader for Stake, the online casino backed by the same ownership and frequently promoted on Kick. By offering them sizable endorsement deals with Stake, Kick has also attracted mainstream stars like the rapper Drake.

Until recently, Kick employed a laissez-faire approach to content moderation, which attracted controversial characters like Mr. Ross, who was banned from Twitch earlier this year. . Other streamers have filmed themselves committing apparent crimes, like trespassing and sexual assault.
To some streamers and viewers, Kick represents a welcome freedom from what they see as the draconian rules and corporate greed on Twitch, which is more closely moderated and in recent years has taken a greater cut of its streamers’ earnings. To others, Kick is allowing harmful views to thrive."
2023-12-03,"Artificial intelligence has been a breakout star in the opening days of COP28, the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Entrepreneurs and researchers have dazzled attendees with predictions that the fast-improving technology could accelerate the world’s efforts to combat climate change and adapt to rising temperatures.
But they have also voiced worries about A.I.’s potential to devour energy, and harm humans and the planet.
Exactly one year after the blockbuster debut of ChatGPT, the chatbot that introduced A.I. to hundreds of millions of people, the climate summit opened last week with a burst of events and announcements centered on A.I. technology. Many were stocked with representatives from Microsoft, Google and other power players in the emerging A.I. industry.
The hope for A.I. breakthroughs in the fight against rising global temperatures flows from the technology’s ability to process vast quantities of information. That allows it to produce insights and efficiencies that far exceed what computers and data scientists have been able to do, with a wide range of applications for climate.

The United Nations said on the summit’s opening day that it was partnering with Microsoft on an A.I.-powered tool to track whether countries are following through on their pledges to reduce fossil fuel emissions, helping to solve what has been one of the thorniest issues in international climate diplomacy.
Other groups offered research highlighting A.I.’s potential to reduce emissions in manufacturing and food production, help locate new renewable energy projects and balance electricity loads during extreme weather events.
Officials from Google and Boston Consulting Group predicted that A.I. could help mitigate as much as one-tenth of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. A team of researchers led by David Sandalow, a former U.S. Energy Department official in President Barack Obama’s administration who is now at Columbia University, issued what it called a road map on Sunday for A.I.’s role in speeding emissions reduction across a wide range of sectors.
In an interview at the conference, Mr. Sandalow said he was particularly excited for the possible ways A.I. could speed up the discovery and design of new materials for low-emission energy technologies like advanced batteries.
“When Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb, he physically took different metals to test how they would react to electric charges — it took him months to identify the best options,” Mr. Sandalow said. “Today, with A.I. tools, we can test a million different options in a second and impose chemical structural constraints to figure out what’s realistic and rapidly accelerate the pace of innovation.”

In a panel discussion on Sunday morning, business executives said A.I. was already helping their companies deliver alerts to people at risk of experiencing flooding, send text messages with hyperlocal planting advice to farmers coping with drought and help people exposed to high levels of air pollution decide the safest times to venture outdoors.
They also said concerns over the technology were holding them back from doing more.
“Climate change is a man-made existential threat,” Natalie Blyth, the global head of commercial banking sustainability at HSBC, said at the event. “What we don’t want is to move from one man-made to another,” she said, referring to crises. “So we have to be responsible and ethical, and really cautious, in how we release and understand some of these technologies.”
Leaders at the companies developing A.I. technology have already cautioned that it could someday pose a risk of extinction to humanity, on par with nuclear war. Researchers at COP28 have focused on a different risk — that the computing power required to run advanced A.I. could be enormous. That electricity appetite could send emissions soaring and make climate change worse.
A peer-reviewed analysis published in October estimated that A.I. systems worldwide could use as much energy in 2027 as all of Sweden. That would almost certainly add to emissions, even though countries are lagging on their pledges to cut them. (A Boston Consulting Group study for Google also noted that powering A.I. would quite likely require vast quantities of water and produce an increasing amount of waste.)
Researchers and company representatives said they hoped the relative benefits of A.I. on the climate would outweigh the significant energy use required to power it. But they were not certain.

Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said in an interview that A.I. was creating huge additional demand for energy. To address that, he said Microsoft was working to improve the sustainability of its data centers and help develop more renewable energy.
“We need to maximize the benefits this can create across the economy, including for sustainability, and make sure that it’s all fueled by carbon-free energy with more energy-efficient data centers,” Mr. Smith said. “Can I do a mathematical equation? Not yet.”
Environmental groups at the summit have seemed to largely embrace the technology. One coalition of them, called We Don’t Have Time, put out a series of videos last week of young activists calling for more urgent climate action, with a twist.
The activists appeared as simulated middle-aged versions of themselves, as if they were speaking from the future. The aging, the group said, was handled by A.I.

2023-12-04,"Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, the wealthy former software executive who entered the presidential campaign in June hoping a back-to-basics appeal on the economy would propel him forward, dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination on Monday.
Though his personal fortune could have kept his campaign afloat, Mr. Burgum’s mild demeanor and resolute focus on three issues, the economy, energy and foreign policy, never caught on with a G.O.P. electorate steeped in the pugilistic flash of Donald J. Trump and the more visceral appeal of social issues.
Mr. Burgum claimed on Monday that he had shifted the conversation on the campaign trail from divisive social issues to energy and foreign policy. He blamed media inattention and Republican Party rules for his poor showing.
“Our decision to run for president came from a place of caring deeply about every American and a mission to re-establish trust in America’s leadership and our institutions of democracy,” he said in a statement announcing he was suspending his campaign. “While this primary process has shaken my trust in many media organizations and political party institutions, it has only strengthened my trust in America.”

Mr. Burgum’s base in tiny, remote North Dakota and a short political résumé had given him almost no name recognition when he began the campaign, leaving even his home-state constituents wondering how he might rise in a crowded field laboring in the shadow of the former president and prohibitive front-runner, Mr. Trump.

But Mr. Burgum believed there was a market for his business acumen — he sold his software company to Microsoft for $1 billion — and a kitchen-table focus that resolutely avoided confrontation with Mr. Trump or anybody else in the field.
He was wrong, never polling above the low single digits. But he may have made an impression on Mr. Trump. Advisers in the former president’s orbit have put out word that Mr. Burgum’s looks and money made him “central casting” for a second Trump term.
Mr. Burgum’s departure technically narrows the field of Republican hopefuls, as Mr. Trump’s critics, such as Senator Mitt Romney of Utah and the commentator George F. Will, issue calls for candidates not named Trump to consolidate around a single alternative. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, former Vice President Mike Pence, the former Texas congressman Will Hurd and Larry Elder, a conservative talk radio host, have also left the race.
That pressure is now on Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, who has shown no sign of traction with Republican voters nationally but whose relatively strong polling in New Hampshire is preventing Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, or Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida from consolidating the anti-Trump vote.

Mr. Burgum’s short-lived presidential run did make some impact in Republican circles, even if it didn’t with Republican voters. To muster the 40,000 individual donors he needed to qualify for the first debate in August, he offered $20 gift cards to the first 50,000 people who donated at least $1 to his campaign.
Just before that debate, he tore his Achilles’ tendon and had to sit during commercial breaks. In the second debate, he largely faded into the background. When he made his presence known, it was to plead with the moderators to let him answer any of the questions that he could make about energy, ostensibly a strong suit in oil-rich North Dakota."
2023-12-05,"Speaking to business leaders at a 2018 dinner at his New Jersey golf club, former President Donald J. Trump hailed the achievement of his recently enacted tax cuts, highlighting a provision that he said would reel in trillions of dollars that American companies had been holding overseas.
“We expect to have in excess of $4 trillion brought back very shortly,” Mr. Trump said. “This is money that would never, ever be seen again by the workers and the people of our country.”
Mr. Trump was referring to measures in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that overhauled how the United States taxed corporate profits that were earned abroad. Those provisions dramatically reduced the incentives that big companies had to keep their cash parked overseas in hopes that those funds would be reinvested at home.
Mr. Trump did not mention that along with that lower tax on foreign earnings, known as the global intangible low-taxed income — or the acronym GILTI — came a one-time levy on three decades’ worth of foreign corporate earnings that would be “repatriated.” Five years later, that tax is the subject of a case being heard before the Supreme Court on Tuesday that has implications for the entire U.S. tax code.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
GILTI as charged?
Before the 2017 tax law was enacted, American companies paid taxes on their worldwide profits at a rate of 35 percent. But they were able to indefinitely defer taxes on profits they earned abroad as long as that money stayed overseas.
If a company wanted to bring that money back into the United States, it would have to pay the 35 percent corporate tax rate minus whatever it had already paid abroad. The potential for a big tax hit encouraged multinational companies to stash their profits in low-tax jurisdictions likes Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The “GILTI” tax that was enacted as part of the 2017 tax law imposed a tax of at least 10.5 percent on the foreign earnings of American companies so that businesses such as Microsoft, Merck and Facebook would see less benefit from pushing profits into foreign subsidiaries. The law also applied a one-time “transition” levy on cash and assets that companies had kept overseas over the previous three decades that had essentially escaped U.S. taxation.
The changes to the international tax code, which were the subject of intense lobbying by corporate America, were projected to raise more than $300 billion over a decade.
A tricky transition tax
The transition tax is at the heart of the case being heard by the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Moore vs. U.S.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
While the tax broadly applied to big corporations like Apple and Alphabet, it also hit some individuals if they owned more than 10 percent of a foreign company. Charles and Kathleen Moore, who live in Washington state, owned an 11 percent stake of KisanKraft, an Indian firm that provides equipment for small farmers. That stake was worth about $500,000.
Because of the transition tax, the Moores owed $15,000 to the U.S. government even though they had never “realized,” or actually received, any of their profits from the investment.
In their lawsuit seeking a refund, the Moores argued that the one-time levy fell outside the power Congress has under the 16th Amendment to tax income.
A ruling with big implications
Legal experts and economists have been following the arguments in the Moore case closely and will be listening for the tenor of questions from the justices because the ruling has the potential to upend large swaths of the U.S. tax code.
In particular, it could influence the ability of the United States to tax overall wealth, including assets like real estate, stock ownership and other assets that have accrued value but whose gains have not been realized by its owners. In other words, whether the government can tax earnings that exist on paper but have not yet been recognized.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog, estimates that the decision could end up costing the federal government anywhere from $3 billion to $1 trillion of lost revenue over the decade and create an array of new loopholes.
A narrow ruling in favor of the Moores, the group suggests, could strike down the transition tax for individuals and “pass-through” firms, whose profits go directly to owners that are taxed as individuals. A broader ruling could strike down the entire transition tax, which could cost nearly $350 billion in lost revenue, and the 10.5 percent tax on foreign earnings, which could cost another $350 billion.
If the Supreme Court takes a more expansive view, it could theoretically also invalidate the new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that Democrats passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. That tax applies to financial income that companies report to their shareholders that could be considered “unrealized” profits.
And potential for global fallout
Although these taxes were passed by Republicans and signed into law by Mr. Trump, the Supreme Court ruling could have ramifications for a key part of President Biden’s economic agenda.
In 2021, the Biden administration reached an agreement with more than 130 countries on a new 15 percent “global minimum tax” that would require companies to pay a rate of at least that much on their global profits no matter where they set up shop. The threshold was intended to give companies less reason to flee to countries with rock-bottom rates, and to put less pressure on nations to slash their tax rates to attract foreign investment.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
To comply with that agreement, the U.S. said it would overhaul the 2017 international tax, raising the rate to 15 percent from 10.5 percent.
It would also seek to change the structure of the GILTI tax so that the new minimum tax is applied on a country-by-country basis, preventing companies from lowering their tax bills simply by seeking out tax havens and “blending” their tax rates.
Congress so far has been unable to pass legislation that would allow the U.S. to comply with the agreement it brokered. A ruling from the Supreme Court that says the U.S. cannot tax foreign income would represent another blow, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, by making it impossible for the U.S. to conform to the deal’s rules."

The future is here, and for many in the media business, it’s terrifying.
In an effort to understand threats facing the media during the upcoming presidential campaign, I asked a technology firm in California to create a “deep fake” video of President Biden, the kind of inauthentic footage that could flummox journalists on Election Day.

Every presidential election cycle in recent memory has been shaped by the emergence of a new technology or the exploitation of an existing one. But 2024 will be more complicated. In addition to threats posed by “deep fakes,” journalists will have to fight a battle for the truth on multiple fronts, grappling with tricky coverage of the criminal proceedings against former President Donald J.

Most election years, coverage of the grueling campaign trail dominates the airwaves, as candidates make the quadrennial pilgrimage to seemingly every fish fry, state fair and union hall between the coasts.
Things will be a little different this year, throwing a curveball to journalists and media executives making coverage decisions.
As Mr. Trump faces criminal charges in New York, Georgia, Washington, D.C., and Florida, one of the dominant stories of the 2024 campaign will most likely be the outcome of those criminal proceedings, said David Axelrod, the architect of former President Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns and a senior fellow at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
That poses a challenge for news organizations, Mr. Axelrod said. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and railed against prosecutors, signaling he would try to use the indictments for political advantage.
With Mr. Trump likely to run his campaign “from the courthouse steps,” journalists will be forced to separate the facts of the case from Mr. Trump’s partisan attacks in real time, Mr. Axelrod said. News directors will be tasked with covering the case without airing falsehoods or lavishing Mr. Trump with gratuitous airtime, as they have in Mr. Trump’s earlier campaigns.
“He knows the case he wants to make, and it has nothing to do with the law,” Mr. Axelrod said. “He’s going to be pushing a story of political persecution.”
Political persecution is exactly what many conservative legal experts think the charges against Mr. Trump amount to. Josh Hammer, a constitutional lawyer and syndicated columnist who has written extensively on the cases against Mr. Trump, said that the proceedings posed an entirely different challenge to mainstream news organizations: being fair to the former president.

Mr. Hammer said that the overwhelming majority of coverage of Mr. Trump’s legal travails, including cable news segments and newspaper editorials, had shown that the press had rendered its guilty verdict before the jury has had a chance to weigh in.
“The hardest thing, by far, is for the media to separate the objective, legal facts from what their obvious preferences are,” said Mr. Hammer, a conservative who is supporting the presidential bid of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.

Deep Fakes
The artificial video of President Biden is just one example of the many types of inauthentic content journalists will grapple with in 2024.
Elections in Chicago and in Slovakia in Eastern Europe have already been disrupted by fake audio clips released before the election, spreading disinformation about candidates during a crucial period, said Sam Gregory, the executive director of Witness, a nonprofit that exposes human rights abuses posed by emerging technologies like deep fakes and generative A.I.
ADVERTISEMENT

Deep fake technology has become so ubiquitous that it is now possible to create inauthentic photos, videos and audio faster than it takes to debunk them, Mr. Gregory said. In addition, most mainstream news organizations have not invested in the resources required to verify and cover misinformation on a tight deadline.
The fake videos and audio also pose another problem. They create an environment where everyone is skeptical of everything, including true information, Mr. Gregory said.
“Knowing that people don’t have the skills to do the detection, it’s really quite easy to say, ‘Oh, that was faked,’ and know that it’s going to be hard for people to prove that it’s actually real,” he said.
Still, there are some opportunities for attentive deep fake sleuths, Mr. Gregory said. While audio is more complicated, images and video have a range of context clues that can help prove whether a snippet of footage is genuine, and you can compare falsified images of an event against genuine to spot inconsistencies.
Any downsides posed by generative A.I. technology to the media must be weighed against its upsides, said Steve Amato, the founder and chief executive of Contend, a studio in Los Angeles that has used the technology to create marketing campaigns for companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Disney.

Mr. Amato cited medicine and education as fields in which the technology could be beneficial, bringing health care providers closer to patients virtually and providing students with immersive learning experiences.
“We’re in awe of all of these things on the positive side, too,” Mr. Amato said.

Decline of Trust
One of the biggest challenges facing the press next year has nothing to do with emerging technology or political attacks. Readers just don’t trust the press the way they used to, experts say, and that could have major consequences come election time.
About a quarter of Americans surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2019 said they don’t have much trust in information they get from the national news media. That number is even higher among Republicans, with roughly a third of those professing little trust in national news.
Deep fakes and accusations of bias from politicians are particularly damaging because they reach voters who are already distrustful of traditional media, said Frank Sesno, a professor of media and public affairs at the George Washington University.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
To combat sagging trust, news executives need to be more transparent with their readers and views about their journalism, showing them how stories get made and why, he said. That doesn’t mean news networks like CNN should play an “endless tape loop” of “journalism primer,” Mr. Sesno said, but it does mean explaining what makes certain topics newsworthy.
“People love being taken behind the scenes,” Mr. Sesno said. “People stood and applauded years ago when I was in a movie theater and they watched ‘Spotlight.’”
In addition to being more open with readers, news organizations should also push back against politicians like Mr. Trump who accuse the press of being dishonest or deliberately spouting misinformation, Mr. Sesno said.
If an airline were facing attacks from competitors who said its planes weren’t safe, the company would be orchestrating a huge public relations campaign to reassure passengers and win back their business, he said.
“When the media does that, it often sounds like self-congratulatory backslapping,” Mr. Sesno said. “But they need to respond.”"

Wall Street and economists will be watching tomorrow’s payrolls report closely for signs on the health of the economy.

The high stakes in Friday’s jobs report
Bonds have been on an impressive monthlong rally fueled by investors’ hopes that the Fed will begin cutting interest rates next year. That bet may be tested as soon as Friday with the release of new payroll data that Wall Street expects will show the labor market cooling further.
The numbers to watch: Economists polled by Reuters estimate that employers had added roughly 150,000 jobs in November, in line with October. (The November figure is expected to include roughly 33,000 United Automobile Workers union workers returning after their strike.)

Wages will again be in focus. Data published on Wednesday by ADP, the payroll processing firm, showed growth in private sector pay has fallen to its lowest level in more than two years. The Fed would welcome similar results on Friday as it watches for data that could influence inflation.

The labor market is shifting. The number of job openings has declined significantly this year, Labor Department data released this week reveals. “Employers were scrambling for workers over the last few years, but demand has cooled and staffing levels are higher across most of the economy,” Bill Adams, Comerica’s chief economist, wrote to investors on Wednesday.
The slower-growing, but more stable, labor market has led to higher worker productivity, he added, “which reduces the wage-price pressures in business cost structures and takes the edge off economywide inflationary pressure.”
Inflation hawks have recently seen lots of promising indicators. Both the jobs and Consumer Price Index reports last month came in below analysts’ expectations, a sign that the Fed’s aggressive raising of borrowing costs — from near zero to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent over a 16-month stretch — has begun to tame inflation.
In other good news for the economy, U.S. gasoline prices hit an 11-month low this week, amid further weakness in oil demand.
Inflation is expected to stay above the Fed’s 2 percent target for another year, most economists predict, but there’s near-unanimous consensus that the central bank will vote to hold interest rates steady at its policy meeting next week.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Nikki Haley takes fire for her growing support from elite donors. In last night’s Republican presidential debate, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy criticized her over recent donations and endorsements from business moguls. Analysts said while the four participants took aim at one another, Donald Trump largely escaped criticism.
Kevin McCarthy, the former House speaker, quits Congress. “I’m leaving the House but not the fight,” the California Republican wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion essay, announcing his departure by year end, before his term expires. McCarthy’s departure is another headache for his successor, Mike Johnson, whose slim majority in the House will get smaller.
Moody’s reportedly tells some China-based workers to stay home. The ratings agency advised some employees to avoid the office before it cut its outlook on China’s sovereign credit rating this week, according to The Financial Times. The decision comes as Western companies in the country have taken greater precautions after a series of raids on their offices and growing sensitivity among Chinese officials over reporting on the economy.

An E.U.-China summit’s tests for the U.S.
European Union leaders met with China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, on Thursday, kicking off talks to press Beijing on a 400 billion euro (around $430 billion) trade imbalance and its support for Russia after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
But a broader question looms over the discussions: How do Europe’s relations with China fit into the American efforts to counter Beijing?
Xi urged Europe to maintain the “momentum” in their relationship, stressing that they were the champions of a multipolar world and should “eliminate all kinds of interference” — a dig at Washington.

The president of the European Commission has said this may include imposing trade restrictions on technologies with potential military applications and creating a mechanism to monitor overseas investments by European companies. In September, the E.U. also said it would begin investigating Chinese subsidies of its electrical vehicle makers, over fears that European manufacturers were being undercut.
President Biden has wooed European allies to help with America’s China strategy, in contrast to the Trump administration. But some of Biden’s other policies have irked E.U. members, including billions in subsidies to accelerate the green transition and domestic semiconductor manufacturing. European officials say that the U.S. approach discriminates against their own companies.
China sees a gap to exploit, betting that Europe’s economic ties will force it to act as a counterweight to Washington. “Beijing hopes that Europe won’t go the same way as the U.S.” Yu Jie, a China expert at the Chatham House research organization, told DealBook.
Next year’s presidential election is also weighing on European thinking. “There is a legitimate concern about the direction of U.S. politics and how much longer Biden will be in office,” Noah Barkin, a senior adviser in the China practice at the Rhodium Group, a research firm, told DealBook. “Could we see a return of a more confrontational approach from the U.S. towards Europe?”

Google’s latest volley in the A.I. battle
OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT last year put Google on the back foot, beating the tech giant to market with an artificial intelligence product that took the public by storm. The search titan was forced to change tack, rushing out new services even if they were flawed.
After releasing an array of A.I.-infused offerings this year, Google has announced perhaps its biggest one yet: a new version of Bard, its ChatGPT rival. The question is whether that’s enough to keep it competitive with OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft. (Investors appeared unimpressed: Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent, fell on Wednesday.)
The new Bard is powered by Gemini, Google’s most advanced A.I. model. The company said Gemini could generate more accurate responses and come closer to mimicking human reasoning in some situations. The technology was capable of beating GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest offering, in several benchmarks, according to Google, including the task of summarizing news articles.
And a version of Gemini, called Nano, is optimized for running on mobile devices. That means that chatbot services could run offline, promising greater speed and versatility — and allowing for more secure processing of personal information, because it wouldn’t have to flow over the internet.

Executives didn’t hold back in praising the new model: “This is the beginning of the Gemini era,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s C.E.O., told The Times.
Except … The most powerful Gemini tech isn’t being made available right away. Its top version, Ultra, will debut next year. The updated edition of Bard that was released on Wednesday is roughly comparable to the version of ChatGPT that’s been available for free since last year; a more powerful version of ChatGPT has been available since early this year.
And, like all chatbots, the refreshed Bard still “hallucinates,” or makes stuff up.
In related news: Apple quietly released a model framework that could let generative A.I. applications run on its laptops. And the money management giant BlackRock plans to begin releasing A.I. tools for clients next month.
“As an industry we should all be braced to hear about a lot more failures. The more money people got before the party ended, the longer the hangover.”
— Jenny Lefcourt, an investor at Freestyle Capital, on the wave of start-ups being forced to shut down as investors close their wallets. About 3,200 private venture-backed U.S. companies have gone out of business this year, according to data compiled for The Times by the analytics company PitchBook; the companies had raised $27.2 billion in venture funding.

What’s your p(doom)?
An inside joke about artificial intelligence’s apocalyptic potential is going increasingly mainstream: Meet p(doom), a way to describe where someone stands on the utopia-to-dystopia spectrum of A.I. outcomes.
Dario Amodei, the chief executive of the A.I. company Anthropic, puts his p(doom) between 10 and 25 percent — higher means you’re more likely to believe the technology could wipe out humanity — while Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., says hers is around 15 percent. As part of a special section on the DealBook Summit, Kevin Roose, The Times’s tech columnist, explains the morbid statistic and its place in A.I. culture:
It’s become a common icebreaker among techies in San Francisco — and an inescapable part of A.I. culture. I’ve been to two tech events this year where a stranger has asked for my p(doom) as casually as if they were asking for directions to the bathroom. “It comes up in almost every dinner conversation,” Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the cloud data platform Box, told me.

Wharton’s board of advisers this week called on Liz Magill, center, to resign as president of the University of Pennsylvania.

University leaders fail to assuage angry donors
The leaders of Harvard, M.I.T. and the University of Pennsylvania face increasing pressure after their disastrous testimony before Congress this week regarding antisemitism on college campuses. At issue: their legalistic responses on whether students calling for the genocide of Jews should be disciplined. (Liz Magill of Penn and Claudine Gay of Harvard later apologized for their testimony.)
Magill appeared the most vulnerable of the three as the school’s trustees debated her future — while the influential board of advisers at Wharton, the university’s business school, called on her to resign.
A firestorm over the testimony is growing in Washington and beyond. House Republicans announced an inquiry into the “learning environments” at the three schools, with the possibility of subpoenas. Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, said that the administrators’ “lack of moral clarity is simply unacceptable.”
Business leaders also expressed outrage. Ross Stevens, a hedge fund manager who has already criticized Penn’s curriculum, said he would withdraw a $100 million gift to the school. The billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who has publicly condemned Harvard students whom he said blamed Israel for the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, called for the presidents of all three universities to be fired.

And David Wolpe, a prominent rabbi, resigned from Harvard’s antisemitism advisory committee, saying that anti-Jewish ideology was so entrenched that he did not think he could make the kind of difference he had hoped for.
Penn “requires new leadership with immediate effect,” Wharton’s board of advisers wrote in a letter to Magill this week. While the board can only make recommendations, its voice is influential: Its chair, Marc Rowan of Apollo Global Management, has called on alumni to withhold donations to Penn. Moreover, three Wharton board members — David Blitzer of Blackstone, Jamie Dinan of York Capital Management and Alberto Duran of Mundivox Communications — are also Penn trustees.
It isn’t clear what the Penn trustees will do with Magill. During an emergency call Thursday, they didn’t vote on whether to oust her, instead urging her and other school leaders to express the university’s values with greater clarity.
But some on the Penn board suggested that further action was needed: Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a nonvoting member, urged fellow trustees to decide whether Magill’s testimony reflected the school’s values. “I expect they’ll be meeting again in the coming days, and I expect them to carefully weigh that question,” he told reporters.

The backlash against the Harvard and M.I.T. presidents hasn’t gone quite as far. Wolpe said that Harvard’s Gay was a “kind and thoughtful person” and stopped short of calling on her to resign. And M.I.T.’s executive committee said that Sally Kornbluth, the school’s president, had “our full and unreserved support.”
In related news: Sam Altman, the C.E.O. of OpenAI, wrote on X that he “was totally wrong” for saying that “antisemitism, particularly on the american left, was not as bad as people claimed.” He added, “i still don’t understand it, really. or know what to do about it.”

The Competition and Markets Authority said that it would begin to examine whether actions including Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in the maker of ChatGPT, which gave it a 49 percent stake in the company, represented an “acquisition of control” that amounted to a de facto merger. (Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said that his company’s relationship with OpenAI was “very different” from, say, Google’s takeover of the A.I. lab DeepMind.) The review is the most prominent effort yet to scrutinize the partnership between two leading A.I. developers.

The OpenAI director at the center of Altman’s ouster speaks
One of the central characters in the short-lived coup at OpenAI last month was Helen Toner, a researcher of artificial intelligence and a board member at the time who had clashed with Sam Altman, the company’s C.E.O.
A recap: Altman was fired and briefly hired by Microsoft; OpenAI employees — including the chief scientist who initially backed firing the C.E.O. — threatened to quit en masse; Altman was reinstated; and most of the board, including Toner, resigned. This all happened within five days.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Toner didn’t get into specifics, but said that the board’s loss of trust in Altman meant that firing him would fulfill the organization’s aim of developing A.I. in a responsible way:
At one point during the heated negotiations, a lawyer for OpenAI said the board’s decision to fire Altman could lead to the company’s collapse. “That would actually be consistent with the mission,” Toner replied at the time, startling some executives in the room.
In the interview, Toner said that comment was in response to what she took as an “intimidation tactic” by the lawyer. She says she was trying to convey that the continued existence of OpenAI isn’t, by definition, necessary for the nonprofit’s broader mission of creating artificial general intelligence that benefits humanity at large. A simultaneous concern of researchers is that AGI, an AI system that can do tasks better than most humans, could also cause harm.We’d like your feedback!

Ralph Nader’s top C.E.O.s
The consumer advocate Ralph Nader has made a career out of criticizing corporations and C.E.O.s and advancing laws to make food, water, work and travel safer. Now the 89-year-old lawyer has shifted gears: He’s singing the praises of exceptional business leaders.
Nader’s latest book, “The Rebellious C.E.O.: 12 Leaders Who Did It Right,” examines the work of executives he thinks did a good job when they ran their companies, including The Body Shop’s Anita Roddick, Patagonia’s Yvon Chouinard and Vanguard’s John Bogle.
The book itself is an example of Nader’s rebellious streak: He told DealBook’s Ephrat Livni that publishers had encouraged him to write about corporate malfeasance, but instead he wanted to highlight principled business leaders.
“Young people think C.E.O.s are just judged by whether they meet market demand,” Nader said in an interview. “This book raises the expectation level.”

The C.E.O.s he has profiled, he said, meet five criteria.
They focused on workers. “Herb Kelleher, the former C.E.O. of Southwest Airlines, always called workers ‘my people’ and he prioritized them even over consumers, but the result was cordiality and a culture of ‘yes’ among staff that consumers could really feel.”
They spoke their mind in public. “Often, C.E.O.s sound like they are speaking from a script and have marbles in their mouths. But those in the book didn’t hesitate to articulate their positions. Roddick of Body Shop was withering on the beauty industry.”
They admitted their mistakes. “They did that to hasten the corrective process. After saying they were wrong, they were quicker to fix problems.”
They weren’t overly secretive. “They all shared their so-called trade secrets and ways of doing business. They rebelled against the proprietary-secret syndrome that can often mask wrongdoing.”
They showed restraint. “All paid attention to profits and knew that without them they could not be bold or take risks. But they did not put profits above all else and they didn’t overpay themselves.”

2023-12-09,"Around noon on Nov. 17, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, logged into a video call from a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. He was in the city for its inaugural Formula 1 race, which had drawn 315,000 visitors including Rihanna and Kylie Minogue.
Mr. Altman, who had parlayed the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot into personal stardom beyond the tech world, had a meeting lined up that day with Ilya Sutskever, the chief scientist of the artificial intelligence start-up. But when the call started, Mr. Altman saw that Dr. Sutskever was not alone — he was virtually flanked by OpenAI’s three independent board members.
Instantly, Mr. Altman knew something was wrong.
Unbeknownst to Mr. Altman, Dr. Sutskever and the three board members had been whispering behind his back for months. They believed Mr. Altman had been dishonest and should no longer lead a company that was driving the A.I. race. On a hush-hush 15-minute video call the previous afternoon, the board members had voted one by one to push Mr. Altman out of OpenAI.
Now they were delivering the news. Shocked that he was being fired from a start-up he had helped found, Mr. Altman widened his eyes and then asked, “How can I help?” The board members urged him to support an interim chief executive. He assured them that he would.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Within hours, Mr. Altman changed his mind and declared war on OpenAI’s board.
His ouster was the culmination of years of simmering tensions at OpenAI that pit those alarmed by A.I.’s power against others who saw the technology as a once-in-a-lifetime profit and prestige bonanza. As divisions deepened, the organization’s leaders sniped and turned on one another. That led to a boardroom brawl that ultimately showed who has the upper hand in A.I.’s future development: Silicon Valley’s tech elite and deep-pocketed corporate interests.
The drama embroiled Microsoft, which had committed $13 billion to OpenAI and weighed in to protect its investment. Many top Silicon Valley executives and investors, including the chief executive of Airbnb, also mobilized to support Mr. Altman."
2023-12-10,"The near implosion of OpenAI, a world leader in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, surfaced a conflict within the organization and the broader community about the speed with which development of the technology should continue and whether slowing it down would aid in making it safer.
As a professor of both A.I. and A.I. ethics, I think this framing of the problem omits the critical question of the kind of A.I. that we accelerate or decelerate.
In my 40 years of A.I. research in natural language processing and computational creativity, I pioneered a series of machine learning advances that let me build the world’s first large-scale online language translator, which quickly spawned the likes of Google Translate and Microsoft’s Bing Translator. You’d be hard pressed to find any arguments against developing translation A.I.s. Reducing misunderstanding between cultures is probably one of the most important things humanity can do to survive the escalating geopolitical polarization.
But A.I. also has a dark side. I saw many of the very same techniques, invented for beneficial purposes by our natural language processing and machine learning community, instead being used in social media, search and recommendation engines to amplify polarization, bias and misinformation in ways that increasingly pose existential threats to democracy. More recently, as A.I. has grown more powerful, we have seen the technology take phishing to a new level by using deepfake voices of your colleagues or loved ones to scam you out of money.

2023-12-12,"Ukraine’s largest mobile operator said it had come under a powerful cyberattack on Tuesday morning that knocked out service to millions of people.
The company, Kyivstar, said that the attack also affected internet access and that it was “unclear” when service would be restored. The interruption poses real danger in a country where many rely on phone alerts to warn them of impending Russian bombardments.
“We are working to eliminate the consequences of this attack to restore communication as soon as possible,” the head of Kyivstar, Oleksandr Komarov, said in a video statement, adding that users’ personal data had not been compromised.
While Mr. Komarov did not explicitly say who was responsible for the attack and there was no immediate claim of responsibility, the implication was clear.

“The war with Russia has many dimensions, and one of them is in cyberspace,” he said.
Ukraine’s domestic intelligence agency, known as the S.B.U., said it would investigate and that one line of inquiry would be whether “Russian special services” were behind the hack.
Officials in the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy, which has frequently come under Russian bombardment, warned on Tuesday morning that the air alarm system was affected.
“The notification system will temporarily not work,” Sumy’s regional military administration said in a statement.
Data showed that connectivity for Kyivstar users plummeted to around 12 percent on Tuesday morning from close to 100 percent, with both fixed-line and mobile services affected, according to NetBlocks, a cybersecurity research group.
At the same time, one of Ukraine’s large financial institutions, Monobank, said that it, too, had been targeted by hackers. While it was not immediately clear if the attacks had been carried out by the same hackers, the effects of both were widely felt. In the western city of Lviv, the departure boards of public transit systems were down and some people were unable to withdraw cash from A.T.M.s.

After Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukrainian telecom companies banded together to share services so that users could roam on a different provider if their service was interrupted. But the national roaming scheme was also offline on Tuesday, operators said.
The Ukrainian military relies heavily on smartphones and mobile data to communicate and coordinate operations, especially on encrypted messaging applications. While Ukraine has other cell providers and the military uses Starlink satellite extensively, it’s possible that the Kyivstar outage affected the ability of Ukrainian troops to coordinate in some places.
Tuesday’s attack was not the first time that Ukrainian telecom companies have been targeted since the February 2022 invasion, and experts say that the attacks are part of a broader campaign.
Russian government-backed hackers targeted users in Ukraine more than any other country last year, according to a report published in February by Google’s Threat Analysis Group.
“While we see these attackers focus heavily on Ukrainian government and military entities, the campaigns we disrupted also show a strong focus on critical infrastructure, utilities and public services, and the media and information space,” the analysis found.
In March, Microsoft warned that a hacking group with ties to the Russian government appeared to be preparing new cyberattacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure and government offices."

Nearly 200 countries pledged to transition away from fossil fuels as part of a compromised COP28 agreement reached today.

The global challenge of phasing out fossil fuels
The COP28 climate summit wrapped up a few hours ago with a compromise agreement that calls on nations to move away from fossil fuels.
But the deal still gives energy-exporting giants like Saudi Arabia plenty of leeway to continue drilling and presents countries and investors with the huge challenge of how to fund a green-energy shift over the next few years.
Here’s what’s in the pact: pledges by countries to wean their economies off fossil fuels in a “just, orderly and equitable manner” this decade; triple their uptake of renewables by 2030; restrict methane emissions; and halt carbon emissions entirely by midcentury.
It’s the first explicit agreement to curb fossil fuel use in the roughly three decades of such multinational negotiations. Scientists say drastic cutbacks are needed to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.

John Kerry, President Biden’s special climate envoy, said he was “in awe of the spirit of cooperation” among negotiators. And Dan Jorgensen, the Danish minister for climate and energy, marveled that such an agreement could be reached at a summit hosted by the oil-rich United Arab Emirates.
Here’s what isn’t in it: tough language on outlawing construction of new coal-burning power plants and specific commitments to help finance poorer nations’ energy transitions. “Asking Nigeria, or indeed, asking Africa, to phase out fossil fuels is like asking us to stop breathing without life support,” said Ishaq Salako, Nigeria’s environmental minister.
Heading into the conference, there was deep skepticism among climate activists and scientists that the Emirates and other OPEC nations would try to water down any deal. And indeed, countries like Saudi Arabia were among those pushing back against efforts to craft a tougher pledge to fully phase out fossil fuels.
The deal is not legally binding. And some critics grumbled that it contained “cavernous loopholes” that would give countries producing fossil fuel incentives to continue oil exploration, including allowing room for “transitional fuels” like natural gas.
Investors didn’t appear worried about what the pledge might mean for the fossil fuel industry: Shares in Chevron and Exxon Mobil were up slightly in premarket trading on Wednesday.

Much work remains. One recent estimate suggests that trillions of dollars in investment is needed to transition to greener fuel sources like wind and solar and avert a climate catastrophe.
“We must transform the international financial system to pursue and achieve our climate goals,” Kerry told delegates. He added that policies were needed to encourage investment in green initiatives “and shift finance away from the things that put our shared prosperity at risk.”

Defending global efforts to rein in Big Tech
As technology giants and its allies urge President Biden to push back against a landmark European Union law meant to curb the power of Big Tech, a group of progressive lawmakers are urging him to stand firm.
In a letter sent on Tuesday to Biden and shared first with DealBook, the legislators defended the Digital Markets Act from claims that it unfairly discriminates against U.S. businesses. “Big Tech companies are trying to squash competition by skewing the rules of digital trade to favor monopolies,” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the letter’s authors, told DealBook.
Silicon Valley argues that the E.U. law violates international trade rules. Tech companies and their lobbyists say the act overwhelmingly takes aim at American companies, with five of six so-called gatekeeper platforms subject to tougher regulations being U.S. firms. They also say it could undermine American efforts to maintain an innovation edge over China.

Amazon has appealed its designation and sought exemptions from parts of the law. And last month, Bytedance’s TikTok, Meta and Apple all filed challenges to the law. (Microsoft and Google said they would not fight their categorization.)
The progressive lawmakers dismissed those complaints. The group, led by Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, said that the law wasn’t targeting companies by national origin. Instead, it’s taking on American tech giants “because they have engaged in anticompetitive tactics.”
More broadly, the American lawmakers pointed to the millions that tech companies have spent fighting efforts to rein in their industry. They added that the tech industry’s attacks on the E.U. law seek to undermine Biden’s antitrust aims.
In other tech regulation news, here’s a reminder of the antitrust challenges that Google faces in the next year.
Musk’s problems on Earth, and above it
A move by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday to continue denying SpaceX’s Starlink nearly $900 million in federal funding is the latest blow to Elon Musk’s corporate empire. Yet that decision drew complaints by a Republican regulator that the Biden administration was setting government agencies against the billionaire’s businesses.
The F.C.C. again rejected Starlink’s request for broadband subsidies. The satellite internet provider had applied in 2020 for $885.5 million worth of federal money to provide service to remote U.S. communities. But the agency withdrew that money last year, after Starlink had agreed to provide service to 642,000 homes and businesses in 35 states.

Starlink, the agency ruled on Tuesday, “failed to demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service.” Among its concerns were failures in SpaceX launching its latest Starship rocket.
Republican F.C.C. commissioners disagreed, calling the decision unfair to Starlink by holding the company to unrealistic performance requirements. “What good is an agreement to build out service by 2025 if the F.C.C. can, on a whim, hold you to it in 2022 instead?” one, Nathan Simington, wrote in his dissent.
The other Republican commissioner, Brendan Carr, went further. In his dissent, Carr wrote that the F.C.C. was joining “the growing list of administrative agencies that are taking action against Elon Musk’s businesses,” pointing to a “pattern of regulatory harassment.” (Tesla is facing multiple government inquiries, including into its Autopilot driver monitoring system, while the S.E.C. is looking into Musk’s $44 billion takeover of what is now X.)
Musk posted on X that “companies that lobbied for this massive earmark (not us) thought they would win, but instead were outperformed by Starlink, so now they’re changing the rules to prevent SpaceX from competing.”
In a statement, Jessica Rosenworcel, the F.C.C.’s chair and a Democrat, said the agency had followed “a careful legal, technical and policy review” in denying Starlink’s request.
In other Musk news: X is expected to bring in just $2.5 billion in ad revenue this year, according to Bloomberg, after bringing in about $1 billion per quarter a year ago. It’s further evidence of big brands pulling back from the social network.

Ackman’s other dispute with Harvard
Harvard’s governing body is standing by Claudine Gay as the school’s president, despite calls to remove her over what critics called insufficiently robust denunciations of antisemitism. (It also cleared her of plagiarism charges raised by conservatives.) But it faulted her initial response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks.
The move is a partial rebuff of Bill Ackman, the hedge fund billionaire who has been among the loudest critics of Gay and Harvard more broadly. The Times spoke with Ackman about his unusual activist campaign against his alma mater. In a response to the article on the social media platform X, the financier detailed another grievance against the university.
Ackman is still upset about a 2017 donation to Harvard. He gave $10 million worth of shares in Coupang, a South Korean e-commerce giant that was then privately held, to the school to help it recruit the highly regarded economist Raj Chetty.
In 2021, the financier said he learned that Coupang was going public at a $50 billion valuation, which would value the Harvard gift at $85 million — only to find out that the school had sold the stock for $10 million back to Coupang:
Harvard had never told me that they had sold the shares. I was never offered the opportunity to buy the shares back for $10m or a higher price, which I would happily have done, had I known the University needed liquidity.
And the notion that Harvard needed $10m of liquidity in the context of a $50 billion endowment is on its face absurd. Any sophisticated investor should also understand that when a private venture-backed company is buying back stock, it is a bad idea to sell.
Ackman wants what he says he’s owed: the right to allocate the profit from that investment, $75 million, to a Harvard-related initiative of his choice.
In other university news: Marc Rowan, the private equity mogul who publicly demanded ousting Liz Magill as the University of Pennsylvania’s president, suggested that he wanted to help further overhaul the school’s governance. Scott Bok, who recently stepped down as the chairman of Penn’s trustee board, warned that “donors should not be able to decide campus policies or determine what is taught.”

2023-12-14,"In a faintly stilted tone and with slightly awkward grammar, the American-accented voice on YouTube last month ridiculed Washington’s handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, claiming that the United States was unable to “play its role as a mediator like China” and “now finds itself in a position of significant isolation.”
The 10-minute post was one of more than 4,500 videos in an unusually large network of YouTube channels spreading pro-China and anti-U.S. narratives, according to a report this week from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a security-focused think tank.
Some of the videos used artificially generated avatars or voice-overs, making the campaign the first influence operation known to the institute to pair A.I. voices with video essays.
The campaign’s goal, according to the report, was clear: to influence global opinion in favor of China and against the United States. The videos promoted narratives that Chinese technology was superior to America’s, that the United States was doomed to economic collapse, and that China and Russia were responsible geopolitical players. Some of the clips fawned over Chinese companies like Huawei and denigrated American companies like Apple.

Content from at least 30 channels in the network drew nearly 120 million views and 730,000 subscribers since last year, along with occasional ads from Western companies, the report found.
Some of the videos featured titles and scripts that seemed to be direct translations of common Chinese phrases and the names of Chinese companies, the report said. Others mentioned information that could be traced to news stories that were produced and circulated primarily in mainland China.
Disinformation — such as the false claim that some Southeast Asian nations had adopted the Chinese yuan as their own currency — was common. The videos were often able to quickly react to current events. Jacinta Keast, an analyst at the Australian institute, wrote that the coordinated campaign might be “one of the most successful influence operations related to China ever witnessed on social media.”
YouTube said in a statement that its teams work around the clock to protect its community, adding that “we have invested heavily in robust systems to proactively detect coordinated influence operations.” The company said it welcomed research efforts and that it had shut down several of the channels mentioned in the report for violating the platform’s policies.
Efforts to push pro-China messaging have proliferated in recent years, but have featured largely low-quality content that attracted limited engagement or failed to sustain meaningful audiences, Ms. Keast said.

“This campaign actually leverages artificial intelligence, which gives it the ability to create persuasive threat content at scale at a very limited cost compared to previous campaigns we’ve seen,” she said.
Several other recent reports have suggested that China has become more aggressive in pressing propaganda denigrating the United States. Historically, its influence operations have focused on defending the Communist Party government and its policies on issues like the persecution of Uyghurs or the fate of Taiwan.
China began targeting the United States more directly amid the mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019 and continuing with the Covid-19 pandemic, echoing longstanding Russian efforts to discredit American leadership and influence at home and aboard.
Over the summer, researchers at Microsoft and other companies unearthed evidence of inauthentic accounts that China employed to falsely accuse the United States of using energy weapons to ignite the deadly wildfires in Hawaii in August.
In a report in September, the State Department accused China of using “deceptive and coercive methods” to shape the global information environment, including the creation of fake social media accounts and even fake news organizations. Other research suggests that China has actively spread disinformation in Taiwan that the United States will eventually betray the island nation.

Meta announced last month that it removed 4,789 Facebook accounts from China that were impersonating Americans to debate political issues, warning that the campaign appeared to be laying the groundwork for interference in the 2024 presidential elections. It was the fifth network with ties to China that Meta had detected this year, the most of any other country.
The advent of artificial technology seems to have drawn special interest from Beijing. Ms. Keast of the Australian institute said that disinformation peddlers were increasingly using easily accessible video editing and A.I. programs to create large volumes of convincing content.
She said that the network of pro-China YouTube channels most likely fed English-language scripts into readily available online text-to-video software or other programs that require no technical expertise and can produce clips within minutes. Such programs often allow users to select A.I.-generated voice narration and customize the gender, accent and tone of voice.
Some of the voices used in the pro-China network were clearly synthetic. Ms. Keast noted that the audio lacked natural pauses and included pronunciation mistakes and occasional notes of electronic interference. Occasionally, multiple channels in the network used the same voice. (One group of videos, however, tried to dupe viewers into thinking a real person was speaking, incorporating audio such as “I’m your host, Steffan.”)
In 39 of the videos, Ms. Keast found at least 10 artificially generated avatars advertised by a British A.I. company. She wrote that she also discovered what may be the first example in an influence operation of a digital avatar created by a Chinese company — a woman in a red dress named Yanni.
The scale of the pro-China network is probably even larger, according to the report. Similar channels appeared to target Indonesian and French people. Three separate channels posted videos about chip production that used similar thumbnail images and the same title translated into English, French and Spanish."
2023-12-15,"More than two years after a California state agency accused the video game maker Activision Blizzard of fostering a work culture of sexual harassment and discrimination against female employees, the agency on Friday withdrew its allegations in a settlement with the company.
As part of the settlement, Activision agreed to set aside as much as $47 million to address accusations of pay disparity and discrimination in promotions for female employees. In total, the company agreed to pay about $54 million in the settlement.
In the agreement, the California Civil Rights Department and Activision Blizzard said that “no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations” about “systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard.” The settlement also said an investigation had not found evidence of wrongdoing by Activision’s board, its executives or its chief executive, Robert Kotick.
The move ends a long-running dispute between the State of California and Activision, which makes video games like Call of Duty, Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft. The company had repeatedly said the accusations about its workplace culture were false.

The case — and the pall it created over the company when it was filed in 2021 — was a factor that led Microsoft to seek to buy Activision because its stock had fallen. Microsoft completed the blockbuster $69 billion deal for Activision this year.
The original complaint from the California Civil Rights Department, which was then called the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, contended that the state had conducted an investigation into Activision and found that it “fostered a pervasive ‘frat boy’ workplace” and that female employees were “subjected to constant sexual harassment.”
At the time, Activision said the complaint included “distorted and, in many cases, false, descriptions” and was “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable state bureaucrats.”
The settlement agreement is subject to court approval and is expected to be filed in court early next week.
The settlement, signed by both parties, said Gilbert Casellas, a former chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, had conducted a review of Activision and found “there was no widespread harassment or recurring pattern or practice of gender harassment” at the company.

Activision agreed to set aside as much as $47 million to pay women who were employees or contract workers at the company from 2015 to 2020 who said they had received inequitable pay.
One of the California agency’s own expert witnesses had testified that when taking into account the seniority of the roles that women at the company held, he did not find a pay disparity. He said there was a disparity when not taking into consideration the rank of the employees.
Activision also agreed to hire an outside consultant to evaluate compensation, promotion policies and training materials as part of the settlement."
2023-12-16,"On Friday, the California state agency that accused the video game maker Activision Blizzard of fostering a culture of sexual harassment against women withdrew those allegations in a $54 million settlement with the company.
The California Civil Rights Department found that “no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations” about “systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard.”
As part of the settlement, however, Activision agreed to pay as much as $47 million to address accusations of pay disparity and discrimination. All female employees who worked at the company between 2015 to 2020 will be offered a kind of monetary relief; they will get paid based on a formula. The company maintains it has offered equitable pay.
It is a stunning reversal. In 2021, the state agency estimated that Activision’s liability was about $1 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. How the state agency went from accusing Activision of fostering a culture in which female employees were “subjected to constant sexual harassment” to withdrawing those claims a couple of years later isn’t clear.

Was it enforcement zeal? This all started with an anonymous complaint in 2018. That letter was followed by a lawsuit from the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2021 and shortly later another from the California Civil Rights Department, which was then called the Department of Fair Employment Housing. The state agency objected to the settlement reached in the E.E.O.C. case. And then finally came a scathing Wall Street Journal story about accusations that the company didn’t handle sexual misconduct allegations properly.
The journalist Matt Taibbi wrote about this investigation: “Corporate regulation often begins with an investigation and ends with a devastating headline, but California flipped the script.”
The settlement  leaves big questions unanswered. In a news release, the California Civil Rights Department declared victory, heralding the $54 million payout and stating that “California remains deeply committed to promoting and enforcing the civil rights of women in the workplace.” That the agency found no legal wrongdoing doesn’t mean it found no wrongdoing at all.
But the case utilized vast resources. The chief counsel at the agency was fired last year. And it all comes about a year after Microsoft, which presumably conducted its own due diligence, paid $69 billion to acquire the gaming company, whose shares took a hit after the allegations came to light.

Google’s antitrust gauntlet
Epic Games’s court victory over Google this week was a big antitrust blow for the search giant. The Fortnite maker had accused Google of illegally throttling competition using its Google Play store, and a San Francisco jury agreed. Google plans to appeal, but the legal fight is just one of a number of cases it faces next year.
Nico Grant, a technology reporter for The Times, covers Google. He talked with DealBook about how the cases could reshape Google’s business.

Apple mostly won a case similar to the one Google just lost, which was also brought by Epic. What explains the different outcomes?
Apple must be very happy it didn’t have to face a San Francisco jury! And that was the significant difference between the cases. A judge ruled in the Apple case.
It’s also notable that Apple has a closed system, in which it makes its own phones and software, so it doesn’t have the complicated relationships with other phone makers that Google does — partnerships that the jury found to be coercive and anticompetitive.
A judge will decide remedies in the Google Play case early next year. What potential changes could Google be ordered to make?
Google could be ordered to open up payment options in the Play Store, so that users can subscribe to apps directly with the developer that made them. The company could also be forced to open up the Android mobile operating system to a broader range of app stores. For instance, Epic would love to offer an app store to Android users.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
In these scenarios, the company’s Play Store business could be much less profitable, because Google would collect fewer fees.
Would Apple have to adopt similar changes?
In Apple’s Epic case, a judge ruled that the company has to allow users to pay app makers directly, rather than Apple processing the payments and taking a cut. But that hasn’t gone into effect as we’re waiting to see if the Supreme Court picks up the case next year. It’s possible that both companies — Apple and Google — will have to offer customers more options for how to pay for apps, even if so far, they’ve taken different routes to get there.
Google faces two other big antitrust cases in the United States — one related to its search business and the other to its dominance in digital advertising. Which of the three cases has potential to impact Google’s business most significantly?
The search case. It concerns Google’s largest business, responsible for more than half of its revenue last year. Closing arguments won’t take place until May and the judge has said he doesn’t have any idea how he’ll rule yet. But if Google is found to have run afoul of antitrust laws in search, there could be very serious consequences. The Justice Department could ask for one of the platforms where it distributes its search engine, such as its Chrome web browser or Android operating system, to be spun off from the company.
Is the outcome in the Google Play case likely to affect rulings in other antitrust cases Google faces in the United States or in the European Union?

A legal expert I spoke to said the cases are so different from one another that this result is not necessarily representative. But it shows that Google isn’t invincible. And it will certainly motivate anti-Google lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic to push harder to replicate the result.
What made a Netflix hit?

Netflix this week gave a peek into its black box, publishing viewing data for over 18,000 titles for the first half of the year. The streaming giant described it as a “big step” toward transparency, and despite its omissions — including whether viewers watched five minutes or an hour of an hourlong show — the release reveals more than what rivals like Disney have published.
Here are some of the most interesting stats to come out of the report, which covers 93.5 billion hours (or 10.7 million years) viewed:
Overall, Netflix originals accounted for 55 percent of hours viewed. The top-watched series: “The Night Agent,” with 812 million hours viewed, followed by Season 2 of “Ginny & Georgia” and the Korean series “The Glory.”
“Suits,” the USA Networks drama that became a global binge-watching phenomenon this year, accounted for 599 million hours across its nine seasons. (The show began running on Netflix in the summer, so the bulk of its views came after the report’s measured period.)
The top-watched productions didn’t have huge stars, who can significantly raise costs. The top-ranked star vehicle was “FUBAR,” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which came in 10th. Jennifer Lopez’s “The Mother” came in next at 14th.
That said, Netflix’s pricey partnerships with mega-producers are paying off. “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story,” from Shonda Rimes, ranked fourth with 503 million hours viewed.

2023-12-18,"When it comes to Christmas, your birthday or any other holiday that involves gifts, do you share ideas with family and friends about what you would like to receive? Or do you prefer surprises?
When you’re the one giving a gift, do you appreciate having as much direction as possible, or do you prefer to give something the person isn’t expecting?
In “All I Want for Christmas Is in This 18-Slide Presentation,” Alyson Krueger writes about the trend of teenagers showcasing the items they want for Christmas in PowerPoints. The article begins:
Every year, Michelle Miller-McNair asks her three children to make lists of what they want for Christmas. “They usually write it down on a piece of paper or send me a link to a website,” she said.
But this holiday season, Ms. Miller-McNair, a comedian in Mooresville, N.C., received something else: an 18-slide PowerPoint presentation with photos, links and QR codes. It was made by one of her daughters, McKinley.
“I worked on it some during school and also when I was at my friend’s house,” McKinley, 13, said. “It took me about two hours total.”
The slide show included Panda Dunks (black-and-white Nike sneakers), makeup and a necklace from Kendra Scott. She marked high priority items with stars. Before delivering her wish list to her parents one weeknight after dinner, she practiced going through her deck.
“I thought through what I was going to say for each slide,” McKinley said.
Her mother was impressed.
“She gave me reasons why she doesn’t just want these items, but she actually needs them,” Ms. Miller-McNair, 40, said. “She had these Uggs that are slide-on-slippers, and she said she needs to put them on when she gets out of basketball practice, so she doesn’t ruin her basketball shoes.”
Let’s hope Santa is tech-savvy. Kids have long been using Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides for gift requests and school projects, but this year’s lists seem more elaborate than ever, with links, photos, decorative themes and QR codes. A number of recent TikTok videos show teenagers taking their parents through their gift requests in meetings that resemble corporate sales pitches.
Students, read the entire article and then tell us:
Does anything in the article remind you of yourself or someone you know, in regard to gift-giving? Did anything seem unfamiliar?
What role does PowerPoint play in your life at school and elsewhere? Are you adept at conveying information in that medium? What about the public speaking aspect of presenting your decks? Does it seem natural to you that teens are using these skills to communicate with their family members about what they want for Christmas?
Would you ever make a video, deck or wish list with links to things you would like to receive as gifts? How do you think your loved ones would react? Or, if you’ve already made such a presentation, what response did it get?
Do you think people tend to appreciate directions and specifics about gift giving? Or do they prefer to choose what they would like to give to people?
Do you think the trend of making and sharing wish lists on TikTok or via PowerPoint decks will catch on more, eventually becoming a holiday standard?

2023-12-19,"One of the first things I asked ChatGPT about, early this year, was myself: “What can you tell me about the writer Vauhini Vara?” It told me I’m a journalist (true, though I’m also a fiction writer), that I was born in California (false) and that I’d won a Gerald Loeb Award and a National Magazine Award (false, false).
After that, I got in this habit of inquiring about myself often. Once, it told me Vauhini Vara was the author of a nonfiction book called “Kinsmen and Strangers: Making Peace in the Northern Territory of Australia.” That, too, was false, but I went with it, responding that I had found the reporting to be “fraught and difficult.”
“Thank you for your important work,” ChatGPT said.
Trolling a product hyped as an almost-human conversationalist, tricking it into revealing its essential bleep-bloopiness, I felt like the heroine in some kind of extended girl-versus-robot power game.
Different forms of artificial intelligence have been in use for a long time, but ChatGPT’s unveiling toward the end of last year was what brought A.I., quite suddenly, into our public consciousness. By February, ChatGPT was, by one metric, the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Our first encounters revealed these technologies as extremely eccentric — recall Kevin Roose’s creepy conversation with Microsoft’s A.I.-powered Bing chatbot, which, in the space of two hours, confided that it wanted to be human and was in love with him — and often, as in my experience, extremely wrong.

A lot happened in A.I. since then: Companies went beyond the basic products of the past, introducing more sophisticated tools like personalized chatbots, services that can process photos and sound alongside text and more. The rivalry between OpenAI and more established tech companies became more intense than ever, even as smaller players gained traction. Governments in China, Europe and the United States took major steps toward regulating the technology’s development while trying not to cede competitive ground to other nations’ industries.
But what distinguished the year, more than any single technological, business or political development, was the way A.I. insinuated itself into our daily lives, teaching us to regard its flaws — creepiness, errors and all — as our own while the companies behind it deftly used us to train up their creation. By May, when it came out that lawyers had used a legal brief that ChatGPT had filled with references to court decisions that didn’t exist, the joke, like the $5,000 fine the lawyers were ordered to pay, was on them, not the technology. “It’s embarrassing,” one of them told the judge."
2023-12-20,"The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday proposed sweeping changes to bolster the key federal rule that has protected children’s privacy online, in one of the most significant attempts by the U.S. government to strengthen consumer privacy in more than a decade.
The changes are intended to fortify the rules underlying the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, a law that restricts the online tracking of youngsters by services like social media apps, video game platforms, toy retailers and digital advertising networks. Regulators said the moves would “shift the burden” of online safety from parents to apps and other digital services while curbing how platforms may use and monetize children’s data.
The proposed changes would require certain online services to turn off targeted advertising by default for children under 13. They would prohibit the online services from using personal details like a child’s cellphone number to induce youngsters to stay on their platforms longer. That means online services would no longer be able to use personal data to bombard young children with push notifications.
The proposed updates would also strengthen security requirements for online services that collect children’s data as well as limit the length of time online services could keep that information. And they would limit the collection of student data by learning apps and other educational-tech providers, by allowing schools to consent to the collection of children’s personal details only for educational purposes, not commercial purposes.

“Kids must be able to play and learn online without being endlessly tracked by companies looking to hoard and monetize their personal data,” Lina M. Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement on Wednesday. She added, “By requiring firms to better safeguard kids’ data, our proposal places affirmative obligations on service providers and prohibits them from outsourcing their responsibilities to parents.”

COPPA is the central federal law protecting children online in the United States, though members of Congress have tried to introduce more expansive online safety bills for children and teenagers since then.
Under the COPPA law, online services aimed at children, or those that know they have children on their platform, must obtain a parent’s permission before collecting, using or sharing personal details — such as first and last names, addresses and phone numbers — from a child under the age of 13.
To comply with the law, popular apps like Instagram and TikTok have terms of service that prohibit children under 13 from setting up accounts. Social media and video game apps typically ask new users to provide their birth dates.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Still, regulators have filed numerous complaints against large tech companies accusing them of failing to set up effective age-gating systems; showing targeted ads to children based on their online behavior without parental permission; enabling strangers to contact children online; or keeping children’s data even after parents asked for it to be deleted. Amazon; Microsoft; Google and its YouTube platform; Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite; and Musical.ly, the social app now known as TikTok, have all paid multimillion-dollar fines to settle charges that they violated the law.
Separately, a coalition of 33 state attorneys general filed a joint federal lawsuit in October against Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, saying the company had violated the children’s privacy law. In particular, the states criticized Meta’s age-checking system, saying the company had allowed millions of underage users to create accounts without parental consent. Meta has said that it spent a decade working to make online experiences safe and age-appropriate for teenagers and that the states’ complaint “mischaracterizes” the company’s work.
The F.T.C. proposed the stronger children’s privacy protections amid heightened public concern over the potential mental health and physical safety risks that popular online services may pose to young people online. Parents, pediatricians and children’s groups warn that social media content recommendation systems have routinely shown inappropriate content promoting self-harm, eating disorders and plastic surgery to young girls. And some school officials worry that social media platforms distract students from their work in class.
States this year have passed more than a dozen laws that restrict minors’ access to social media networks or pornography sites. Industry trade groups have successfully sued to temporarily block several of those laws.
The F.T.C. began reviewing the children’s privacy rule in 2019, receiving more than 175,000 comments from tech and advertising industry trade groups, video content developers, consumer advocacy groups and members of Congress. The resulting proposal runs more than 150 pages.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Proposed changes include narrowing an exception that allows online services to collect persistent identification codes for children for certain internal operations, like product improvement, consumer personalization or fraud prevention, without parental consent.
The proposed changes would prohibit online operators from employing such user-tracking codes to maximize the amount of time children spend on their platforms. That means online services would not be able to use techniques like sending mobile phone notifications “to prompt the child to engage with the site or service, without verifiable parental consent,” according to the proposal.
How online services would comply with the changes is not yet known. Members of the public have 60 days to comment on the proposals, after which the commission will vote.
The initial reactions by industry trade groups were mixed.
The Software and Information Industry Association, whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, said that it was “grateful” for the F.T.C.’s efforts to consider outside input and that the agency’s proposal had cited the group’s recommendations.
“We are interested in participating in the next phase of the effort and hopeful the F.T.C. will take a similarly thoughtful approach,” Paul Lekas, the group’s head of global public policy, said in an email.

NetChoice, whose members include TikTok, Snap, Amazon, Google and Meta, by contrast, said the agency’s proposed changes went too far by setting defaults that parents might not want. The group has sued several states to block new laws that would limit access to online services by minors.
“With this new rule, the F.T.C. is overriding the wishes of parents,” Carl Szabo, the group’s general counsel, said in a statement. It “will make it even harder for websites to provide necessary services to children as approved by their parents.”"

David Zaslav, the C.E.O. of Warner Bros. Discovery, set the media world buzzing yesterday after holding potential merger talks with Paramount.

The wrinkles in a potential media merger
Media deal makers aren’t waiting until 2024 to get started on potential big-ticket M.&A.
News that David Zaslav, the C.E.O. of Warner Bros. Discovery, expressed interest in combining with Paramount set tongues wagging about a possible union of Hollywood’s top deal candidates. But it’s unclear whether this will be the combination that gets completed, DealBook’s Lauren Hirsch and Michael de la Merced write.
A deal could make sense. Their streaming platforms — Max and Paramount+ — are far smaller than Netflix or Disney+, so putting them together might create a more robust competitor. (Of note: Both companies own valuable sports streaming rights, which could help draw subscribers.)
And it could give the united business more leverage in negotiations with cable providers on the fees for carrying legacy television networks like Comedy Central and Discovery, especially as those channels suffer from falling ratings and stagnant ad sales.
But there are plenty of reasons not to do a deal. Warner Bros. Discovery has $40 billion in debt and $5 billion in free cash flow, while Paramount has negative cash flow and $15 billion in debt. In other words, the combined company would have a crushing debt load and little money to pay that down or spend on content — potentially forcing Zaslav to cut more costs, after previous efforts torched his standing with content creators.
ADVERTISEMENT
SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
The new business would also be heavily reliant on declining TV channels, a situation that investors don’t like. (Paramount, however, may be able to sell BET and VH1 to a buyer such as the media mogul Byron Allen.)
Investors aren’t enthusiastic about the potential combination: Warner Bros. Discovery shares fell almost 6 percent on Wednesday after Axios scooped the talks, while Paramount’s stock declined 2 percent.
There are other unknowns:
Shari Redstone, who runs Paramount’s parent, may be up for a deal, given that she’s exploring selling a controlling stake in her company to Skydance, a studio backed by the investment firm RedBird Capital. But is the media mogul John Malone, who sits on the Warner Bros. Discovery board, also game?
The Biden administration’s antitrust enforcers, who just finalized an aggressive overhaul of merger rules, is likely to be skeptical of such a combination.
How far can talks go without running afoul of I.R.S. rules that would impose a big tax hit on Warner Bros. Discovery if it does a big deal before April?
Some observers think there’s a Kabuki element to these talks. CNBC’s Alex Sherman and The Information’s Martin Peers wonder whether Zaslav’s approach to Paramount, and its quick leak to the media, was a market trial balloon — or a way to draw out Comcast, whose NBCUniversal has long been considered a potential buyer of Warner Bros. Discovery. (NBCUniversal, with its deeper pockets, is financially a more attractive partner for Zaslav’s company, though it would also face antitrust concerns.)
Not all deal makers think that’s the case here. But with investors widely believing that the media industry must consolidate in some way, the only question is which deals get done.

The International Trade Commission denied the company’s effort to pause the action while Apple appeals a ruling that it infringed a competitor’s patents.

The Biden administration may raise tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle makers. Officials are considering increasing the 25 percent levy (imposed by the Trump administration) to boost the U.S. clean energy sector, according to The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, China said on Thursday that it would halt the export of rare earth metals and magnets, crucial ingredients in the making of military hardware and EVs.
More companies warn of supply chain disruptions from Red Sea attacks. Ikea and Electrolux said delivery of products may be delayed, as Houthi rebels in Yemen vow to step up their attacks on ships. More than 100 container ships have been redirected to circumnavigate Africa, a detour that could add more than a week to journey times and push shipping rates higher.

Consider the eye-popping numbers of the potential investment: At $15 billion, excluding the potential new investment, Anthropic’s valuation would be triple what it was in a fund-raising round this spring. And, according to The Information, it would be 75 times the company’s annualized revenue — more than the 66 times multiple in OpenAI’s current share sale.
Anthropic has already raised five rounds this year, according to data from Crunchbase. The company has collected $7.6 billion from investors, including tech giants like Amazon and Google that are eager to hook Anthropic’s Claude A.I. model into their sprawling cloud computing platforms.
That huge sum is necessary, considering the extremely expensive costs of the computing power needed to develop A.I. systems. (That’s a reason much of Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI is in cloud credits.)
It suggests that investors remain interested in A.I. leaders. Overall investment in generative A.I. start-ups declined in the third quarter, according to PitchBook, with some investors citing growing pains with the technology and some cooling of the fervor for chatbots. Anthropic is clearly an exception, as is Mistral, a French start-up that in its first seven months has raised more than $650 million and closed a new funding round this month.
Investors are still willing to back a business with unorthodox corporate governance. Oversight at Anthropic isn’t as overtly messy as OpenAI’s setup; it has a board that has a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders, for instance.

But the start-up, whose founders left OpenAI because of concerns about safety, has also created a so-called long-term benefit trust, made up of financially disinterested directors meant to ensure the company lives up to its mission of producing A.I. that benefits humanity.
The banking sector’s $160 billion conundrum
Since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last spring, Wall Street has been on high alert for the next big systemic risk. Atop its list of worries is the banking sector’s exposure to the souring commercial real estate market.
A new study puts a number on what’s at stake. Banks face up to $160 billion in losses from an anticipated wave of defaults on their commercial real estate loans, researchers from Columbia, Stanford, U.S.C., and Northwestern write in a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Separate research this week estimated that commercial real estate, or C.R.E., values are set to drop by more than $500 billion in 2024. And Morgan Stanley calculated earlier this year that lenders would need to negotiate more than $1.5 trillion of their C.R.E. portfolios by the end of 2025 to avert defaults.

The potential tsunami of losses could put banks at risk. “Our analysis, reflecting market conditions up to Q3 2023, reveal that C.R.E. risk can induce anywhere from dozens to over 300 mainly smaller regional banks joining the ranks of banks at risk of solvency runs,” the researchers wrote in the N.B.E.R. paper.
C.R.E. is the lifeblood of most banks’ lending businesses, a market estimated at roughly $20 trillion. The sector has grown more precarious because of a potentially toxic cocktail of post-pandemic office vacancies, the work-from-home trend, the highest interest rates in decades and a slowing economy.
Regulators are concerned, too. In its annual report released last week, the Financial Stability Oversight Council — a watchdog created in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis — called commercial real estate the biggest financial risk to the economy. The massive C.R.E. crunch may also force banks to cut back on lending elsewhere, the F.S.O.C. warned.

The popularity of “buy now, pay later” offers has surprised economists, who warn it may encourage younger and lower-income consumers to take on more debt.

Buy now, pay “phantom debt” later
Strong retail spending has been one of the surprises of this holiday season, bucking economists’ predictions that consumers were about to pull back in the face of high inflation and reduced savings.
The resurgence of so-called “buy now, pay later” loans may be fueling the shopping splurge, and some economists are worried, report The Times’s Ben Casselman and Jordyn Holman.
The loans, which allow consumers to pay for purchases in installments, often interest-free, have soared in popularity because of high prices and interest rates. Retailers have used them to attract customers and to get people to spend more.
But such loans may be encouraging younger and lower-income Americans to take on too much debt, according to consumer groups and some lawmakers. And because such loans aren’t routinely reported to credit bureaus or captured in public data, they could also represent a hidden source of risk to the financial system.
“The more I dig into it, the more concerned I am,” said Tim Quinlan, a Wells Fargo economist who recently published a report that described pay-later loans as “phantom debt.”

2023-12-22,"Apple has opened negotiations in recent weeks with major news and publishing organizations, seeking permission to use their material in the company’s development of generative artificial intelligence systems, according to four people familiar with the discussions.
The technology giant has floated multiyear deals worth at least $50 million to license the archives of news articles, said the people with knowledge of talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The news organizations contacted by Apple include Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker; NBC News; and IAC, which owns People, The Daily Beast and Better Homes and Gardens.
The negotiations mark one of the earliest examples of how Apple is trying to catch up to rivals in the race to develop generative A.I., which allows computers to create images and chat like a human. The technology, which artificial intelligence experts refer to as neural networks, is built by using troves of photos or digital text to recognize patterns. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, a computer can learn to recognize a cat.
Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Meta and other companies have released chatbots and other products built with the technology. The tools could change the way people work and generate billions of dollars in sales.

But Apple has been absent from the public discussion of A.I. Its virtual assistant, Siri, has remained largely stagnant in the decade since its release.
A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. During a call with analysts last month, Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, said Apple has work “going on” connected to A.I. but declined to elaborate."

2023-12-26,"Twelve months ago, Tom Lee bet that 2023 was going to turn out just fine.
While many of his peers on Wall Street were sounding the alarm over an impending economic downturn, Mr. Lee, a stock market strategist who spent more than a decade running J.P. Morgan’s equity research before setting up his own firm, forecast in December 2022 that falling inflation and economic resilience would buck the broadly bearish mood.
Mr. Lee was right. Despite political brinkmanship over the nation’s debt ceiling, a banking crisis in March, fears over the cost of funding the government’s fiscal deficit, a continuing war in Ukraine and fresh conflict in Israel, the core of Mr. Lee’s prediction came to fruition in 2023. Inflation has fallen, unemployment remains low, and the S&P 500 has risen 25 percent.
Most investors disagreed with Mr. Lee’s prognosis; in 2023, they pulled more than $70 billion out of funds that buy U.S. stocks, according to data from EPFR Global. Only a quarter of fund managers whose performance is benchmarked to the S&P 500 have beaten the index’s returns this year, according to Morningstar Direct.
“2023 was a year that people were so convinced we would have a recession and they looked at everything through that lens,” said Mr. Lee, head of research for Fundstrat. “Then there were folks like us that said we don’t know the future but there is little evidence a recession is coming.”

Heading into 2024, prognosticators tracked by Bloomberg share Mr. Lee’s optimism more broadly, including analysts at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Binky Chadha, an equity strategist at Deutsche Bank who bet against the consensus with Mr. Lee last year, is also predicting that the bull rally will continue.
At the same time, analysts at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and others maintain that the absence of a severe downturn in 2023 doesn’t mean it has been avoided altogether, since the full effect of higher interest rates is still working through the economy.
“There are a lot of things that have to go right to still come out the other side unscathed,” said Mike Wilson, chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. He revised his bearish bets in July, although even then he didn’t budge from his stance that the economy would worsen.
Central to both views is the path of inflation and whether the Federal Reserve can return the pace of price rises back to its target of 2 percent before the economy sputters.
The Fed began putting the brakes on the economy in March 2022 by raising interest rates. But the central bank has recently appeared confident that it is getting close to its target. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.1 percent over the year through November, down from a peak of over 9 percent through June 2022. Core C.P.I., which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remains at 4 percent.

The sooner the Fed gets to its target, the sooner it can start to take its foot off the brakes of the economy. The central bank recently forecast lower interest rates next year. Even without rate cuts, falling inflation and historically high wage growth could embolden consumers to keep spending, offering a tailwind for corporate profits to soar even higher, Mr. Lee said.

“2023 was a year that people were so convinced we would have a recession, and they looked at everything through that lens,” said Tom Lee, head of research for Fundstrat.

Others are less confident. While the labor market remains strong, recent months have shown early signs of weakness, with a modest rise in unemployment as more people begin seeking work. Credit card delinquencies and the number of people overdue on car loan repayments are also rising, as investors note that consumer finances have become more stretched after the repeal of plans to forgive student loan debt. With inflation still above the Fed’s target, these cracks could widen in the coming year.
Jason Hunter, an equity strategist at J.P. Morgan, said the market appeared to be ignoring an expected slowdown in growth next year. “The equity market looks like it is priced for a very rosy outcome,” he said.

While the service side of the economy, such as restaurants, has held up well this year, manufacturing has struggled after a stretch of overproduction in 2022.

Energy stocks remain negative for the year, after being the standout performer in 2022. Utilities stocks — typically a haven when other parts of the market are in turmoil, thanks to their steady income stream — have fallen more than 10 percent since January. Smaller companies, too, have languished, with the Russell 2000 index still roughly 15 percent off its previous peak and18 percent higher for the year.
For Mr. Lee and the growing herd of market bulls, these unloved areas of the market offer an opportunity in 2024. A turn in the manufacturing slump, as companies work through the backlog of inventories and begin placing new orders, could help companies that struggled in 2023 catch up.
Mr. Chadha of Deutsche Bank noted that economists had consistently underappreciated the amount of growth in the economy this year. He thinks it’s likely to happen again.
“We think we will get positive-growth surprises that will propel equities higher,” he said.
Those who are more bearish say that a manufacturing recovery is far from assured and that the slide in those sectors of the market in 2023 could be a warning that if it weren’t for a few behemoth technology stocks that lifted the S&P 500 higher, the stock rally would look very different.
These tech stocks have been so dominant, they even earned themselves the nickname the Magnificent Seven. It’s a group that boasts some of the biggest companies in the market: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla. Without them, the S&P 500 would have risen around 10 percent this year.

“If average companies don’t see an improvement, that to me is the risk of a hard landing,” Mr. Wilson of Morgan Stanley said. “If we are going to have a recession, it’ll be when these businesses decide to start letting people go.”
For Mr. Lee, history suggests a different outcome. When the S&P 500 has risen by at least 15 percent for the year, which has happened 28 times back to 1950, the index has risen by another 10 percent the next year half the time, and is positive over 70 percent of the time, he said. And when interest rates have previously been between 3 and 5 percent, the valuation of the stock market has been similar to what it is now, suggesting the rally isn’t overdone.
“People are trying to be too theoretical about the stock market,” Mr. Lee said. “The acceptance of chaos is a more correct way to approach the market.”"

Chinese spies rise to meet the U.S.
China’s Ministry of State Security is deploying artificial intelligence and other advanced technology to compete with the C.I.A. At the same time, the C.I.A. is pouring resources into monitoring Chinese companies that are developing A.I., quantum computing and other such tools.
The ministry’s main source of information was once gossip at embassy dinner parties. But it has built itself up through wider recruitment, including of U.S. citizens. It has also sharpened itself through better training, a bigger budget and the use of advanced technologies.
A.I. is key to its goals. The M.S.S. has technology that creates instant dossiers of people of interest in Beijing, including American spies and others. It has intensified its intelligence collection on U.S. companies developing technology with both military and civilian uses.
The C.I.A.’s spending on China has doubled since the start of the Biden administration. Gathering detailed information on commercial trade secrets was once the kind of espionage the U.S. avoided, but now information about China’s development of emerging technologies is now considered as important as divining its conventional military might or the machinations of its leaders.

The Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft
The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement yesterday, opening a new front in the legal battle over the unauthorized use of published work to train artificial intelligence technologies.
The lawsuit contends that millions of Times articles were used to train automated chatbots, which now compete with the news outlet. The complaint cites several examples in which a chatbot provided users with near-verbatim excerpts from Times articles that would otherwise require a paid subscription to view.

It apparently follows an impasse in negotiations involving The Times, Microsoft and OpenAI. The Times is the first major U.S. media organization to sue the companies, which made ChatGPT, over copyright issues associated with its written works.
Explanation: Chatbots can generate answers that rely on journalism by The Times to answer questions about events or the news. The Times said that readers might be satisfied with the response and decline to visit The Times’s website, reducing web traffic and revenue.

How will we eat in 2024?
Each year, my colleague Kim Severson tries to anticipate the coming food trends. She sifts through predictions from big food companies, PR firms, restaurant groups and more to prognosticate next year’s plate. Here’s some of what she has found:
Meals are so 2023. Next year will be all about snacks, which one forecaster called “the ultimate lowbrow cool.”
But meal-flavored cocktails are coming. Brace yourself for umami-heavy drinks tasting of chicken or caprese.
Water and hydration are still en vogue. Look for “wearable hydration sensors,” flavored syrups and water stewardship for conservation-conscious consumers.
Buckwheat is a rising star. It’s rich in protein and fiber — and is showing up in everything from foie gras to hot chocolate to monkfish.
There’s more, including soup, florals, A.I. and natural fermentation. Read Kim’s full review here.

2023-12-29,"For months, some of the biggest players in the U.S. media industry have been in confidential talks with OpenAI on a tricky issue: the price and terms of licensing their content to the artificial intelligence company.
The curtain on those negotiations was pulled back this week when The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, alleging that the companies used its content without permission to build artificial intelligence products.
The Times said that before suing, it had been talking with the companies for months about a deal. And it was not alone. Other news organizations — including Gannett, the largest U.S. newspaper company; News Corp, the owner of The Wall Street Journal; and IAC, the digital colossus behind The Daily Beast and the magazine publisher Dotdash Meredith — have been in talks with OpenAI, said three people familiar with the negotiations, who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential talks.
The News/Media Alliance, which represents more than 2,200 news organizations in North America, has also been talking with OpenAI about coming up with a framework for a deal that would suit its members, a person familiar with the talks said.

Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s biggest investor and is incorporating OpenAI’s technology into its products, has held talks as well. “We’ve had thoughtful conversations with a number of publishers, and look forward to future discussions,” said Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft.
Companies like OpenAI and Microsoft have sought licensing deals with news organizations to train A.I. systems that can produce humanlike prose. Those systems in turn power applications like chatbots, from which the companies can gain revenue.
Nearly a dozen publishing executives and media business experts say the talks have been complicated by the rapid development of artificial intelligence applications in the marketplace, which has raised thorny issues for the future of the media industry.
In a statement, OpenAI said that it respected the rights of content creators and owners and that it believed they should benefit from A.I. technology, citing its deals with The Associated Press and the German publishing conglomerate Axel Springer.
“We’re continuing to have productive conversations with many of them around the world to discuss their questions about A.I.,” Kayla Wood, a spokeswoman for OpenAI, said in a statement. “We’re optimistic we will continue to find mutually beneficial ways to work together in support of a rich news ecosystem.”

News publishers have had precarious relations with tech companies since losing much of their traditional advertising businesses to newcomers like Google and Facebook more than a decade ago, and publishing executives are wary of selling their content too cheaply.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
“I think part of the reason news organizations are now looking so carefully at OpenAI is because they have 20 years of history indicating that if we’re not careful, we’ll give away the keys to the kingdom,” said Andrew Morse, the publisher of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the flagship newspaper of Cox Media Group, which is not in talks with OpenAI.
There is also fear that artificial intelligence applications may provide inaccurate information citing their articles, damaging the companies’ credibility.
“We’ve been through a period of a decade of misinformation and disinformation, and that was pre-A.I.,” said Ken Doctor, a media analyst and entrepreneur. “Now with A.I. on the scene, we are just at the dawn of the age where anyone has the ability to further and multiply misinformation and disinformation. And that, of course, terrifies news publishers.”
Still, some news organizations have struck deals. The agreement with The Associated Press, announced in July, allows OpenAI to license The A.P.’s archive of news articles. The financial terms were not disclosed.

Axel Springer, whose holdings include Politico and Business Insider, went further: This month, it struck a multiyear deal that gave OpenAI access to its news archive and allowed the artificial intelligence firm to use newly published articles in apps like ChatGPT. The deal, which includes a “performance fee” based on how much OpenAI uses its content, is worth more than $10 million per year, a person familiar with the agreement said.
Some media companies have decided not to prioritize commercial deals with OpenAI. Bloomberg, which has a vast data terminal business that uses artificial intelligence, is focusing on furthering its own A.I. efforts, according to a person familiar with the company’s strategy. The Washington Post has also not been in negotiations with OpenAI in recent months, a person familiar with the company’s efforts said.
Despite the tension between the news industry and OpenAI, some publishing executives struck a measured note on the potential upsides of A.I. Jim Friedlich, the chief executive of the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, the nonprofit owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said news organizations and artificial intelligence firms were “increasingly co-dependent,” since users wanted A.I. technology with reliable information.
“It’s important to all parties to achieve a settlement, and if possible that it be done quickly,” he said. “Whether that takes months or years is anyone’s guess.”"
2023-12-30,"The boom in artificial intelligence tools that draw on troves of content from across the internet has begun to test the bounds of copyright law.
Authors and a leading photo agency have brought suit over the past year, contending that their intellectual property was illegally used to train A.I. systems, which can produce humanlike prose and power applications like chatbots.
Now they have been joined in the spotlight by the news industry. The New York Times filed a lawsuit on Wednesday accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of copyright infringement, the first such challenge by a major American news organization over the use of artificial intelligence.
The lawsuit contends that OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing Chat can produce content nearly identical to Times articles, allowing the companies to “free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products without permission or payment.”

OpenAI and Microsoft have not had an opportunity to respond in court. But after the lawsuit was filed, those companies noted that they were in discussions with a number of news organizations on using their content — and, in the case of OpenAI, had begun to sign deals.
Without such agreements, the limits may be worked out in the courts, with significant repercussions. Data is crucial to developing generative A.I. technologies — which can generate text, images and other media on their own — and to the business models of companies doing that work.
“Copyright will be one of the key points that shapes the generative A.I. industry,” said Fred Havemeyer, an analyst at the financial research firm Macquarie.
A central consideration is the “fair use” doctrine in intellectual property law, which allows creators to build upon copyrighted work. Among other factors, defendants in copyright cases need to prove that they transformed the content substantially and are not competing in the same market as a substitute for the work of the original creator.
A review quoting passages from a book, for example, could be considered fair use because it builds on that content to create new, unique work. Selling extended excerpts from the book, on the other hand, may violate the doctrine.

SKIP ADVERTISEMENT
Courts have not weighed in on how those standards apply to A.I. tools.
“There isn’t a clear answer to whether or not in the United States that is copyright infringement or whether it’s fair use,” said Ryan Abbott, a lawyer at Brown Neri Smith & Khan who handles intellectual property cases. “In the meantime, we have lots of lawsuits moving forward with potentially billions of dollars at stake.”

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
It could be a while before the industry gets definitive answers.
The lawsuits posing these questions are in early stages of litigation. If they don’t produce settlements (as most litigation does), it could be years until a Federal District Court rules on the matter. Those rulings would probably be appealed, and appellate decisions could vary by circuit, which could potentially elevate the question to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Getting there could take about a decade, Mr. Abbott said. “A decade is an eternity in the market that we’re currently living through,” he said.
The Times said in its suit that it had been in talks with Microsoft and OpenAI about terms for resolving the dispute, possibly including a license. The Associated Press and Axel Springer, the German owner of outlets like Politico and Business Insider, have recently reached data licensing agreements with OpenAI.
Taking cases to trial could answer vital questions about what copyrighted data A.I. developers are able to use and how. But it could also simply serve as leverage for a plaintiff to secure a more favorable licensing deal through a settlement.

“Ultimately, whether or not this lawsuit ends up shaping copyright law will be determined by whether the suit is really about the future of fair use and copyright, or whether it’s a salvo in a negotiation,” Jane Ginsburg, a professor at Columbia Law School, said of the lawsuit by The Times.
How the legal landscape unfolds could shape the nascent yet heavily capitalized A.I. industry.
Some A.I. companies have been flooded with venture capital in the past year after the public rollout of ChatGPT went viral. A stock plan under consideration could value OpenAI at over $80 billion; Microsoft has invested $13 billion in the company and has incorporated its technology into its own products. But questions about the use of intellectual property to train models have been top of mind for investors, Mr. Havemeyer said.
Competition in the A.I. field may boil down to data haves and have-nots.
Companies with the rights to large quantities of data, such as Adobe and Bloomberg — or that have amassed their own data, such as Meta and Google — have started developing their own A.I. tools. Mr. Havemeyer noted that an established company like Microsoft was well equipped to secure data licensing agreements and tackle legal challenges. But start-ups with less capital may have a harder time obtaining the data they need to compete.
“Generative A.I. begins and ends with data,” Mr. Havemeyer said.
